2020,"Struggling To Make Sense Of It All: The Emotional Process Of Sensemaking In Scrutinized Occupations -- This paper examines the practice world of practitioners working in ‘scrutinized’ occupations through a qualitative study of emergency management practitioners who were involved in a major bushfire incident, participated in the subsequent public inquiry, and were responsible for the implementation of the inquiry’s recommendations. We show how such practitioners engage with their practice world through three different ‘modes of involvement’ as a result of a cycle of scrutiny that flows from the incident, through the inquiry, to implementation. We also explore the different emotions experienced by these practitioners during this process and draw attention to the important role of one particular emotion – anxiety – which takes different forms depending on the particular mode of involvement. Our findings indicate that anxiety helps practitioners deal with scrutiny by facilitating sensemaking and developing knowledge, allowing us to develop a general model of sensemaking and emotion in scrutinized occupations more broadly."
2020,"Breaking Organizational Silence -- It is a common practice in organizations for employees to withhold or distort—“sugarcoat”—some of their opinions, especially when these opinions concern unpleasant news that needs to be communicated to managers. However, sometimes such withholding of information grows into the pervasive silencing of issues and this may have detrimental effects on the business as well as the well-being of organizational members. Therefore, it is important for both practitioners and scholars to understand how organizations might reverse the negative dynamics around such silenced issues. With this paper, we describe one of the ways in which organizations may break the silence and contribute to the theoretical understanding of the process. We draw on a unique ethnographic study dataset, in which, at the time of the observation, employees collaborated with their managers, and attempted to break the silence surrounding a particularly problematic organizational issue. We trace the process of how anxiety around the silenced issue built up in the organization, and how attempts to break the silence culminated in a metaphorical, humorous, and hyperbolized public revelation. These findings show the importance of courage, strategic use of humor and adaptive planning, and contribute to the understanding of socio-organizational practices around the complex issues embedded in organizational cultures."
2020,"Uncertainty as Generated through Social Practices in Biotechnology Entrepreneuring -- In this paper, we extend the research on entrepreneurial uncertainty by applying a practice lens, and analyzing how uncertainty is generated in entrepreneuring practices. Contrary to the established notion of uncertainty as a characteristic of environment or as an individual knowledge problem, we analyze uncertainty as a social phenomenon and a part of social entrepreneuring practices. We draw on the entrepreneurship as practice approach and analyze how practices of creating “proof of concept”—the feasibility of a new technology—generate uncertainty, and how entrepreneurial firms organize in response to this uncertainty in order to break the tension that surrounds the creation of a “proof of concept”. Based on a comprehensive study of a large biotechnology firm and the network of entrepreneurial firms that are their partners or potential collaborators, we demonstrate how uncertainty manifests through contrasting understanding of time and knowing."
2020,"Influences of Top Managers’ Pay Dispersions on Organizational Responses to Performance Shortfalls -- The behavioral theory of the firm has been tested across various organizational change settings. This literature shows that firms pursue change when performance drops below aspirations, but relatively scarce research examines how pay dispersions of the dominant coalition influence this process. Integrating insights from behavioral theory and pay dispersion research and applying them to the business divestiture context, we propose that top executives facing total pay dispersions likely experience team conflicts and dissatisfaction, attenuating divestiture rate in response to performance shortfalls. Managers with distinct time horizons, however, exhibit varying behaviors whereby unexercisable option pay dispersion weakens divestiture rate due to widening pay gap over the long-term whereas exercisable options and stock pay dispersions foster divestiture tendencies to improve short-term performance and close the pay gap."
2020,"Historical Political Ideology and Firm Innovation: Worldwide Evidence of R&D Investments (1982-2016) -- Dominant national political ideology during founding or initial public offering (IPO) shapes a firm’s structures and routines—leaving an organizational ideological imprint—and persistently affects firms’ innovation. I argue that the communist (capitalist) ideological imprint discourages (encourages) firms’ innovation enduringly. To triangulate the theoretical mechanism, I argue that the communist (capitalist) ideological imprint weakens (strengthens) the impact of two determinants of innovation, i.e. competitive aspirations and organizational slack. Meanwhile, I differentiate types of sensitive periods when imprinting processes take place and argue that founding imprint is more powerful than its IPO counterpart. Finally, I suggest that the subsequent IPO imprint modifies the influence of founding imprint, and therefore imprinting is a punctuated process. Empirical analysis of a longitudinal sample of worldwide firms’ research and development (R&D) investment supports my hypotheses. My study contributes to imprinting theory and strategy literature."
2020,"Organization of Production and Labor Income Inequality -- This paper investigates how and why the organization of production (relative sizes of occupational groups, distribution of firm sizes), can be correlated with measures of income inequality (GINI, income in the top 1%) in market economies, where individuals with different skills make occupational choices as employees, solo self-employed, or entrepreneur-managers. We identify the parameters of the production technology, the organizational costs, and the distribution of skills in the population that jointly determine the size of occupational groups and the level of inequality in the distribution of income in the market equilibrium. The comparative static analysis reveals the contribution to income inequality of “market” and “organization”."
2020,"Historical Protestant Influence, Subnational Institutions, and Organizational Structure in the U.S. -- I argue that variation across U.S. states regarding historical Protestant influence leads to discernible subnational institutions. These varying institutional patterns among states in turn lead to differences in organizational structures of firms. I also suggest that Catholic activities tend to reshape the historical Protestant influence. Using a hand-collected longitudinal dataset of states from 1776 to 2017 and a panel dataset of publicly traded firms in the U.S. from 1992 to 2017, I found that historical Protestant influence results in flatter hierarchy and greater gender equality in firms, partly through formal and informal institutions that promote liberalism and equality. This effect is weakened by the role of Catholic immigrants through political contestation. Finally, the Catholic reform in 1960s diminished the Protestantism-Catholicism divide, thereby reducing the dampening effect of Catholic immigrants on the historical Protestant influence. My study contributes to (1) institutional theory by unraveling the emergence and evolution of subnational institutions through a religious lens, (2) imprinting perspective by considering the dynamics introduced by counter-imprinting entities (i.e., the Catholic activities), and (3) literature on organizational structure by revealing overlooked antecedents from the nexus of history, religion, and institution."
2020,"Solidarity All Around: How Spatial Context Influences Perceptions of Organizational Solidarity -- More than seventy years of research in social networks and microgeography have shown that spa- tial proximity offers individuals opportunities to interact and form social ties, aggregating up to a structural influence of the arrangement of space on social networks among organization members. But space has the power to do more than structure opportunities for individuals to interact directly. Spatial design also structures opportunities to observe others’ interactions, an extra-network in- formation channel that may influence social perceptions, and consequently the way individuals relate to their organization. One important way in which individuals relate to their organization is the degree to which they perceive it as a strong ‘community’, where their colleagues are mutually supportive and socially cohesive, best captured by the long-established concept of social solidar- ity. Social solidarity has largely been conceived of as arising from social interactions and social network structures among workers. We present an extra-network information theory of spatial ar- rangement’s influence on individual perceptions of social solidarity in their organization. Testing this theory in the context of a North American financial technology company, our results suggest that there is indeed an influence of spatial arrangements on perceptions of social solidarity. This apparent influence of spatial context is not mediated via the social network among workers, suggesting that spatial design may be able to directly influence the way in which workers relate to their organization."
2020,"The Uncertain and the Unexpected:Pathways to the Evolution of Job Structures in the Throes of Hiring -- In this paper, we examine the evolution of job structures in the throes of the hiring process – how jobs change in the time between making a decision to bring in someone to do a body of work and officially hiring someone. We analyze interviews about startup hiring and find that during hiring tasks are added and removed from jobs, jobs are abandoned, replaced, and moved, and hiring processes are re-launched. There are three pathways for this evolution, each shaped by a form of the uncertain or the unexpected: not knowing about what the job should be; lacking understanding of labor markets; and unexpected events. Not surprisingly, most of the jobs on these pathways are new to their organizations but contrary to common conceptions, these processes are not the product of managers who lack experience or who use lax hiring practices. The pathways differ in their longer-term consequences."
2020,"The Role of Proto-forms in the Emergence of Historic Movie Theaters in Chicago Communities:1896-1962 -- We develop a novel concept of proto-form to understand the “pre-birth” processes of organizational form emergence, which take place between the discovery of a technological or social novelty and the eventual emergence of organizational forms dedicated to exploiting this novelty. We define a proto-form as a provisional organizational form that arises when entrepreneurs and enthusiasts experiment with possible applications of a novelty by using preexisting organizational forms as a basis. Proto-forms are a key step in the emergence of dedicated organizational forms, because they provide audiences with initial understandings of the novelty’s socio-cultural meanings. We theorize that the cultural status of proto-forms can affect how quickly dedicated forms with either similar or dissimilar cultural status emerge in geographic communities. Using data on all historic movie-showing venues in Chicago, Illinois, 1896-1962, we predicted and found that the proliferation of proto-forms with low cultural status in a community accelerated the emergence of dedicated organizational forms with low cultural status and delayed the emergence of dedicated forms with high cultural status. We predicted the opposite for the proliferation of proto-forms with high cultural status and found partial support to this prediction. These results provide initial evidence for the important role of proto-forms in understanding the emergence of new organizational forms."
2020,"Seeing Through the Lens of Event Stigma: Media Evaluations of Referees in the Aftermath of a Scandal -- We study how event stigma can shape the evaluation of the conduct of actors at the field-level. Specifically, we argue that in the aftermath of a traumatic event, event stigma breeds skepticism in a generalized fashion, so that all actors within the field should face more contestation. Moreover, we expect high-status actors to face a larger increase in the contestation levels compared to low-status ones because event stigma is associated with a generalized loss of trust, which is especially damaging to high-status actors. Finally, we argue that event stigma will translate into a stronger preference for monitoring and control; as a result, perceived failures to act (omissions) will face particular contestation, and especially so in the case of high-status actors. A study of media coverage of Italian football referees’ decisions before and after the 2006 Calciopoli scandal provides support for our arguments."
2020,"Shareholder Unrest and Its Influence on CEO Career Outcomes -- We examine the effects of shareholder unrest on CEOs’ career outcomes. Shareholder unrest –the overall scale of shareholder dissatisfaction with company practices, as manifested in support for shareholder resolutions – is a quintessential form of a broader class of performance indicators: stakeholders’ publicly-registered assessments, which are distinct from customary metrics of managerial performance, such as profitability or share price. We theorize that shareholder unrest activates the mechanisms of settling up and executive job demands, with distinct outcomes from each. Drawing on the concept of settling up, we hypothesize that shareholder unrest negatively affects the careers of incumbent CEOs, reducing pay and increasing likelihood of dismissal. Applying executive job demands theory, we hypothesize that new CEOs of unrest-laden firms receive higher initial pay packages to deal with these inherited job demands. Finally, we unpack a distinction typically overlooked by studying two broad types of resolutions, those aimed at wealth maximization and those that are CSR-oriented, theorizing that these two types of unrest exert equal effects on CEOs’ career outcomes. Testing our ideas on a longitudinal sample of U.S. corporations, we find considerable support for our hypotheses."
2020,"Indexical Judgment: The Construction of Valuation Devices for Art and Antiques -- The growth of models, metrics and indicators is a hallmark of the modern economy and contemporary markets. Yet there is little empirical research on how designers balance their goals and beliefs with the constraints and politics faced when developing important valuation devices. The special features of artworks as unique, difficult-to-value, and with a value based on social consensus, make the art market an excellent context to study such processes. Using two pioneering art price indices, the Times-Sotheby and Sotheby Index, we develop a theoretical framework to examine market indicator development. Through interviews with key figures and extensive documentary analysis, we trace the entwined forces of epistemic beliefs about the nature of value and available resources in valuation-producing organizations. The result is a process through which different modes of justification and commensurability interact as designers develop a workable set of valuation practices into systematic valuation devices. Our research contributes to research on organizational and calculative infrastructures underpinning markets, particularly in creating market indicators, and extends a growing literature linking strategy and valuation, particularly since strategic modification of indices is constrained by the need to maintain established methods for longitudinal comparison, a hallmark of many valuation devices."
2020,"Rescripting client action: Emotion work and the boundaries of professional jurisdiction -- This paper addresses a major gap in the study of professions, which is the absence of clients in research on the boundaries of professional jurisdiction. To do so, it shifts the standard analytical focus in two important ways: from inter-profession relations to the professional?client relationship; and from a profession-centered perspective to a client-centered one. Numerous empirical studies of client movements in professionalized fields such as health care, education and religion show that clients organize in many ways to redraw service arrangements and the boundaries of professional jurisdiction. Yet, one wouldn’t learn much about this phenomenon by reading existing organizational research on professionalized fields, which largely explains service arrangements and jurisdictional boundaries as resulting from inter-professional struggles for epistemic control over domains of activity, while all but ignoring client action. Building upon insights from Hirschman’s exit, voice, and loyalty framework, Mannheim’s theory of ideology and utopia, and organizational research informed by Goffman’s idea of an “interaction order”, we develop a six-part typology of client action scripts. We then elucidate how different forms of emotion work carried out in framing contests between ‘incumbent’ professionals and ‘challenger’ clients can evoke distinct felt emotions that, in turn, rescript client action toward different boundary projects."
2020,"Playing Different Games: A Dual Tournament Theory of Executive Promotions -- Despite robust research on CEOs, little is known about the non-CEO executive labor market and the promotion paths of TMT members to CEO. Tournament theory suggests employees will strive to win a promotion tournament if the pay gap is large and has generally assumed there is no relevant difference in external or internal pay gaps as the skills needed for promotion are similar across firms. However, considering the increasing prevalence of external succession in today’s executive labor market, we challenge this theoretical assumption and argue that differences in internal and external pay gaps create two separate but simultaneous tournaments for CEO promotion and propose a dual tournament theory of executive promotions. By arguing that there are two tournaments that TMT members could attend to differently based on their individual characteristics, we highlight how the same motivational theory can suggest dissimilar types of actions across TMT members in the same firm. While traditional tournament theory suggests a large CEO-TMT pay gap can be an effective governance mechanism, our dual tournament theory explains how the actions taken by TMT members pursuing external tournaments may tend towards opportunistic behaviors resulting in increased agency costs and governance issues for firms."
2020,"Stigma Entrepreneurship: Theorizing The Role Of Moral Anger In Entrepreneurship -- Negative emotions are usually described as hindrances, impediments, or discouragements of entrepreneurial action. We contend that this is not always the case, offering a new explanation of how negative emotions associated with stigmatization might spark entrepreneurial action. We argue that stigmatization, as both an individual (i.e., first-person) and collective (i.e., third-person or group) experience, generates negative emotions, particularly moral anger. We explain how moral anger can then spur an individual to start an entrepreneurial venture with the aim of reducing relevant stigma(s). In doing so, we develop a theoretical process model for what we call stigma entrepreneurship, which we define as entrepreneurial efforts primarily directed at stigma reduction. We contribute to the literatures on entrepreneurship and on stigma management by highlighting the overlooked role of entrepreneurship as a tool for stigma reduction that goes beyond individual identity management strategies or collective action. Answering calls for research on the illegitimate, the informal, and the underdog, our exploration of stigma entrepreneurship challenges conventional wisdom and expands understandings of the possibilities within entrepreneurship."
2020,"“Ella says…” How authority in eponymous firms is authored through ventriloquial acts -- This article advances ‘communicative constitution of organization’ (Ashcraft, Kuhn & Cooren, 2009: 7) understandings of how authoring authority organizes daily practice. We show how authority is eponymously authored during ventriloquial acts and produces multidirectional, temporal and fluid organizing patterns. Our ethnography of a cosmetics firm demonstrates how performative, segmented and misfiring authoring impacts quotidian activity in subtle, nuanced and precarious ways. This research also enhances communicative understandings of authority and elevates eponymy’s role within organization and management theorizing."
2020,"Hold your horses: negative anticipatory impression management and its motivations -- An emergent stream of research shows that managers engage in various impression management strategies to manage external perceptions by placing their firms in the best possible light. Drawing from this work, we develop theory around when and why managers may choose to engage in a novel form of preemptive impression management—negative anticipatory impression management (NAIM)—to recalibrate stakeholder expectations. Specifically, we posit that managers use actions and communications that deliberately convey pessimism to reduce the liability of inflated expectations. We then propose two factors—media coverage and the manager’s regulatory focus—that act as moderators. This underscores how managers use negative information to their advantage and further grounds the relevance of executive personality in impression management decision-making."
2020,"Who can start a stock exchange? Silent legitimacy, mundane materiality, and the genesis of markets -- This study presents an account of the genesis and development of two stock markets established in London in 1995. It draws on elite interviews and documentary sources to explore how the founders of these markets sought to legitimize them as stable and durable venues for security trade. The analysis accounts for the success of one market, AIM, which adopted a novel organisation and became a model for growth company markets worldwide, and the failure of the other, OFEX, despite a strategy of isomorphic conformity to the expected norms of market operation. The study uses insights from the STS-inflected study of markets to present an account of legitimacy as embedded in taken-for-granted socio-material structures. We term this phenomenon ‘silent legitimacy’. The successful market was supported by such silent legitimacy, which outweighed the ostensive strategy of isomorphic regulatory and procedural legitimacy followed by its rival. Contributing to a nascent ‘material turn’ in institutional theory, the study argues that the markets-as-institutions literature can be strengthened through theoretical engagement with the market-studies literature and empirical attention to the mundane material dimensions of institutional fields."
2020,"A macro perspective on status dynamics: The hollowing out and hallowing of Haute Couture -- Extant organizational status research has dedicated significant attention to the dynamics underlying status-based market interactions as well as the potential sources of alterations in actors’ status positions. It has, however, provided few insights into the status dynamics of an entire field. In this research, we shed light on the categorical work undertaken to preserve a category’s status over time in the context of an evolving status order. We explore our research question in the field of the French high-end fashion industry, from 1911 until today. This setting is appropriate because high-end fashion is structured by a sophisticated stratified system of categories and key actors who actively contribute to the construction and alteration of these categories. Focusing on the haute couture category, we show how, over time, the field main professional association attempted to juggle two imperatives that became increasingly at odds: maintaining the category status while ensuring its survival. We argue that such status maintenance work can only be understood by taking into account the status order in which the category is embedded, an order contested and remodeled through the joint influence of endogenous and exogenous forces."
2020,"Elaborating on the Abstract: Group Meaning-Making in a Colombian Microsavings Program -- Access to formal financial products like savings and checking accounts constitutes a hallmark feature of economic development. Across the globe, governments and other organizations promote ‘financial inclusion’ among lower-income citizens. Seeking to understand why individuals embrace or resist financial services, scholars focus on institutional, cultural, and material explanations, but pay less attention to organizations and small groups. In this study, we argue that such factors are crucial to understanding the development of financial preferences. We investigate a government-sponsored microsavings program in Colombia and find that participants became less interested in banking services over the course of the program, even as they gained access to appropriate accounts and their savings increased. Turning to qualitative data to understand this curious finding, we show that organizational efforts to disseminate abstract information about banking triggered a process of information ‘elaboration’ among group members, leading many to develop financial preferences at odds with those promoted by the government. This paper integrates insights from economic sociology, organizational theory, and microsociology to advance theories of financial preference. In doing so, it reveals how organizational efforts to compress information, followed by group efforts to personalize and expand upon it, can shape preferences and potentially undermine organizational goals."
2020,"Paradoxical Learning: A Process Study of Firefighting Innovations -- Process research increasingly emphasizes how organizations face tensions from competing demands characterized by multilevel complexity and irrationality. Although such theory development provides valuable advancements to understand paradox phenomena, it also suffers from complexity with regard to pragmatic problem-solving. This paper shows how process research can offer resolutions if feedback is added to the equation of competing demands. In particular, we focus on the complex equation of amplified innovation in knotted tensions across multiple multilevel paradoxes. Analysis of field data from the rescue service sector in Sweden and work to improve firefighting operations serve as illustrative case material. The results uncover how four types of feedback on competing demands (single-level pole, single-level paradox tension, tension-to-pole, and tension-to-tension in the context of multiple multilevel paradoxes) operate as they unfold in concurrent construction. The concurrent construction of the four feedback types triggers, reinforces, and expands learning about paradoxes. We propose that the notion of paradoxical learning captures this process and examine how multiple multilevel tensions are dealt with when innovative work complexity unfolds. Paradoxical learning clarifies how organizational agents can amplify movements in an increasingly richer world of competing demands."
2020,"Reinventing Dominance: Temporal Work in Processes of an Incumbent’s Self-Disruption -- Seminal literature has shown how disruptive technology can be a cause for the demise of established firms and pointed out that new entrants—unencumbered by history—move quickly and disrupt industries, whereas incumbents run out of time because they are pinned down by their past. We examine how history can serve as the basis for temporal work in enduring processes of self-disruption through an in-depth study of how ABB acted as a disruptor in the power transmission systems market by opening a new technology platform enabling cities’ “smart grids”. Findings from this study highlight a process that relies on the incumbent’s past providing alternative uses of history to cope with evolving tensions—which are triggered by external and internal relationships, and synchronizing imaginative sediments and changes in routines. We explicate this process of self-disruption and discuss its implications for research on enduring disruptions by technological change and innovation."
2020,"Frenemies: When Firms and Activists Collaborate -- This paper examines how contentious targeting of firms by movements influences the formation of firm-activist collaborations. I integrate research on social movements and interorganizational collaborations to argue that the symbiosis between contention and collaboration posited by existing theory, privileges firms’ incentives for collaboration and overlooks activists’ risks in collaborating with movement adversaries. I test my arguments using a 25-year panel of contentious and collaborative interactions between 118 activist organizations and 500 firms in the U.S., and network data on movements. Contrary to existing theory, I find that contentious targeting of a firm by a movement reduces the firm’s chances of collaborating with an activist in that movement. Instead, contention catalyzes collaboration only when a firm’s reputation provides assurance it will follow-through on its collaboration commitments, and when the risk of criticism from the movement is reduced. The findings support a view of firm-activist collaborations as socially-contested, highlighting a novel precursor to contention driving collaboration: cooperative ties between contentious and collaborative activists. While intuitively we may expect activists to seek to preserve social bonds by avoiding collaborations with their friends’ adversaries, it is precisely in the absence of pre-existing social bonds that activists and firms fail to transform contention into collaboration."
2020,"Problem Formulation between Organizations -- Although prior research has paid much attention to problem solving, it has overlooked a related but distinctive issue: problem formulation in the case of ill-structured and complex problems between organizations. To understand problem formulation between organizations, I used a case study design to examine the everyday problems experienced by the same client organization and main contractor in two sequential green building projects. Following the comparison of similar problems within and between projects, a core insight emerges about hasty coupling: a generalized process by which elements evoked in the description of a problem’s symptoms prompt managers to turn to specific coordination safeguards (e.g., contracts and professional roles). Through the study of hasty coupling, I generate insights into when managers take the route of formulating the actual problem versus when they seek off-the-shelf formulations. However, each route has distinct implications for the quality of problem formulation and ultimately the project’s time and cost overruns. Although the managers worked together in the first project, prior experience did not enhance problem formulation between them in the second project. The findings bring together research on problem formulation and problem solving and the interorganizational coordination literature under a generalized process of problem formulation between organizations."
2020,"Time and Punishment: How Individuals Respond to Being Sanctioned in Voluntary Organizations -- Although sanctioning is a common feature of social life, researchers hold different expectations about how members respond when sanctioned by their peers. One school of thought suggests that individuals respond to sanctions by becoming more cooperative, or prosocial, towards the group. Another line of research shows that individuals have negative emotional reactions to being punished and become less cooperative. In this study, we offer an avenue for reconciling these seemingly-conflicting viewpoints in the context of voluntary organizations, where cooperation is crucial. We build on theories of dependence and propose that individuals’ responses to sanctions shift over time as they become increasingly dependent on other members to achieve valued outcomes. We draw on unique data from microsavings groups in Colombia to develop and test this proposition, using qualitative data to flesh out the proposed mechanism and longitudinal, quantitative records to test the hypothesis. We find that individuals initially respond to being sanctioned by reducing their prosocial contributions, but that their responses become increasingly cooperative and prosocial over time. Taking social psychological concepts generated in laboratories and extending them to small groups in an economic development program, this study generates a fresh vision of sanctions as temporally- and relationally-dependent, while also revealing how processes of social control can shape inequality in voluntary organizations."
2020,"Socialized to Redistribute? CEO Social Class Background and Corporate Social Responsibility -- Understanding firm investment in CSR is one of the most discussed and contentious topics in strategy research. Yet, there is no clear imperative about investing in CSR. It is thus important to understand: what influences the extent to which CEOs redistribute firm resources to CSR? We draw on the intra-family theoretical model and theorize an inverted U-shaped relationship between CEO social class background and CSR investment. We also theorize that CEO tenure and recent firm performance moderate this effect. The results of our analyses are consistent with our theorizing. This study provides insight about drivers of CSR and contributes to research on CEO attributes by focusing on a CEO attribute—social class background—outside of the traditional focus on workplace experiences and personality."
2020,"The Cost of Forgoing Status Rewards: Major League Baseball Teams and the Free Agent Market -- Status provides organizations with privilege rewards including being able to gain discounts on resources. However, if organizations take advantage of status rewards, there is a risk of status loss based on the external perception of lower quality. The study asks if organizations will seek to take advantage of available status rewards or if the goal of status accumulation will predominate. Using a sample of Major League Baseball (MLB) free-agent contract signings, this study finds that high-status teams pay more for resources than their lower-status counterparts, regardless of the quality or status of the players. Implications for researchers address the cost of status may be ignored based on status goals, while practitioners can understand how the quest social approval may be driving up the cost of their resources."
2020,"Selective (De)coupling and Change in Clinical Outcomes -- Through an in-depth longitudinal study of hospitals’ implementation of quality improvement initiatives within a single jurisdiction, I build on previous empirical findings of heterogenous organizational responses to common institutional pressures. Yet, rather than honing the causes of this heterogeneity, I examine its relationship to desired outcomes. I use Fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (Fs/QCA) to uncover intended and unintended consequences of hospitals’ heterogenous responses and theorize on why some configurations are associated with improved or worsened clinical outcomes. Findings suggest that management and healthcare scholars ought to pay greater attention to the subversive and superficial nature of some responses, as these are associated with a decline in clinical outcomes. Indeed, scholars have recognized that: “In fragmented and rationalized environments, organizations seek to respond to a greater number of external stakeholders; adapting to these external pressures can generate both internal complexity and inconsistency (Bromley & Powell, 2012, p. 20).” I find that coupling to two conflicting pressures, such as pressures to reduce costs while improving the quality of clinical services, creates internal inconsistencies which results in dynamics of subversion. In contrast, implementing clinical standards in the absence of an ambition to improve clinical services leads to the superficial implementation of these standards."
2020,"How community alignment affects bank survival: Institutional legacies and resource dependence -- Despite an increasing academic interest in the interaction between organizations and geographic communities, we know little about how firms strategically align themselves to communities, and when they benefit from such practices. Based on research on resource dependence and institutional legacies, we develop a theory on community alignment by organizations. We propose that organizations can attempt to align by adjusting key organizational elements or fulfilling the community’s social needs. The benefits of such efforts can offset the added costs, particularly at times of financial crisis, through the forging of mutual dependency which offers an informational advantage, access to community social capital and joint actions. Testing our hypotheses using data from the U.S. commercial banking industry, we find that banks with stronger organizational and social community alignment are less likely to fail, especially during economic crises. Our theory and findings contribute to research on organization and community interactions, institutional legacies, and competition between large and small corporations."
2020,"Inter-state Political Risk, Types of Political Ties and International Joint Ventures -- Inter-state political conflict is an importance source of political risks that can deter firms’ cross-border collaborations. While prior research has shown how business leaders’ political ties can help firms access information and state-controlled resources, little is known about whether and how such political ties at home country can help firms cope with inter-state political risk. We differentiate two types of political ties, business leaders’ social ties and family ties with government officials. We argue that social ties can alleviate the negative impact of inter-state political risk by helping the firms to navigate regulatory uncertainties, whereas family ties may worsen the negative impact by associating the firms with the state and tarnishing their legitimacy as viable foreign partners. We find support in the setting of Korean business groups’ entry into China through joint ventures during 1990-2005. Our study contributes to the literature on political risks and corporate political ties by differentiating ties based on the nature of the relationship and revealing their different effects in coping with inter-state political risk."
2020,"Good Fun or Laughing Stock? How CEO Trait Humor Affects Social Approval, Reputation, and Legitimacy -- We theorize how a CEO’s level of trait humor – i.e., the tendency to engage in playful social behavior that establishes incongruent relationship or meaning and, thereby, amuses followers – affects external judgements of the focal organization. Combining the social psychology of humor with research on social evaluations of firms, we argue that CEO humor has differential effects, depending on humor type (positive versus negative, and self-directed versus others-directed) and the category of social evaluations (social approval, legitimacy, and reputation). For instance, we propose that a CEO’s inclination to display affiliative humor engenders positive emotions and perceptions of social closeness and, in turn, social approval. Conversely, self-enhancing humor and aggressive humor convey more negative emotions and decrease social closeness and thus lower social approval. Moreover, as humor oftentimes violates expected norms, higher levels of non-affiliative CEO humor negatively affect perceptions of the firm’s legitimacy. Interestingly, aggressive CEO humor can foster firm reputation, as it demonstrates a CEO’s confidence in future performance and conveys self-beliefs of superior status. We also theorize that the effects of CEO humor differ, depending on the CEO’s celebrity and the type of external evaluators. Our analysis contributes to research on corporate reputation, executive personality, and leader humor."
2020,"Organizational Crises and Potential In-Group Members’ Anticipated Social Identity -- This study examines how potential employers shape potential employees’ social identity before joining the organization. Drawing on social identity theory and signaling theory, we argue that potential in-group members (potential employees) follow a routine similar to that of in-group members (employees) when assessing the value of organizational membership for their self-concepts. Our study uses organizational crises as identity-threatening events to investigate whether and how they influence potential employees’ anticipations about social identity, as well as their perceptions of the organization’s attractiveness. Empirical evidence from our scenario-based experiments with 1,617 individuals conducted in the United Kingdom and the United States shows that identity changes occurring from organizational crises decrease organizational attractiveness and that anticipated self-continuity and anticipated self-esteem mediate this relationship. The effects become stronger with increasing crisis responsibility."
2020,"Necessity is the Mother of Innovation: A Quasi-Experimental Study of Stress-Driven Innovation -- Innovative teams are typically assumed to be successful teams, but little is known about innovation in teams that face stressful conditions. Although necessary to cope with such conditions, innovation or the generation of novel and useful ideas and their implementation to create improvement, may also provoke further stress, leading to negative rather than beneficial outcomes. To study this, we conducted a simulation study of teams simultaneously working on time-critical tasks of physically manufacturing greetings cards in a competitive environment. Our manipulation of the working conditions was such that teams were likely to experience varying degrees of stress during the manufacturing process and face problems and challenges that could be solved by means of innovation. Using a multi-level path analysis on a sample of 43 teams composed of 345 participants our findings revealed an inverted U-shaped relationship between severity of exposure to stressors and team innovation. In turn, team innovation was negatively associated with team performance but positively with individual team member wellbeing in terms of enthusiasm. Our study contributes to the literature on the dark side of innovation by showing how stress-driven innovation is a paradoxical phenomenon that might be both beneficial and dysfunctional."
2020,"When Advice Can Harm -- Strategic decisions can be hard, and when facing hard problems, decision-makers commonly seek others’ advice. But finding a good advisor is tricky: People are biased judges of skill, even more so in the wicked environment that typifies strategic decisions, where data can be incomplete, outcomes ambiguous, and causality foggy. Relying on empirical data, we model when and how person-to-person sharing can cause bad advice (or ideas) to spread, even without conformity pressures or malintent. We begin by reviewing how people systematically misjudge relative skill: misestimating how their own skill compares to others’. We show that if skill misjudgment is assumed away, advice taking is always beneficial. But under realistic assumptions, advice sharing benefits the low-skilled while harms highly skilled decision-makers, degrading collective skill and potentially eliminating top performers. We test an organizational design solution: When decision-makers are clustered, paying more attention to close associates, the range of practices increases. There lies a trade-off: Encouraging advice exchange homogenizes skill whereas discouraging it benefits diversity. For scholars of organizations and knowledge, we offer a novel theoretical mechanism, rooted in extensive evidence. It is distinct from prior concerns about normative conformity, and thus may be resistant to the proposed remedies. For practitioners, we sound a warning against the risks of popular practices that are meant to increase interaction and advice exchange in firms, among entrepreneurs, and in crowds."
2020,"The Other Invisible Hand: How Markets Can Propagate Valuation Errors -- Markets are ubiquitous in modern society, a status often justified by their presumed ability to aggregate bits of incomplete information from many actors into a single, unbiased estimate of value. While acknowledging markets’ unique role, we suggest that they can also be potent in spreading individual valuation errors, thus inflating collective mistakes — price bubbles. We offer a more sociological interpretation of bubbles by advancing the notion that the very ubiquity of markets can cause traders to overweight market signals in a manner that weakens the quality of individual decision-making. We examine this process empirically in laboratory studies of asset trading in experimental markets. We find that even when traders possess and comprehend the information needed to price assets accurately, they remain overly attentive to market signals (i.e., others’ pricing). Thus, they are likely to mimic other traders’ valuations — even if at odds with the asset’s true value. We further predict and find that such overattention is also sensitive to differences in levels of ambiguity, as predicted by a perspective that theorizes markets as institutionalized practices. We conclude by highlighting the relevance of our perspective, empirical approach, and supportive findings for future research on valuation errors, price bubbles, market dynamics, and micro-institutional processes."
2020,"Stigma Types and Directors’ Professional Devaluation from Firm Bankruptcy -- We examine the effects of a stigmatizing event, firm bankruptcy, on board directors’ professional future. We differentiate between directors associated with the origin of the bankruptcy and with bankruptcy filing, and ask how the stigma of incompetence (associated with bankruptcy origination) and stigma by association (or courtesy stigma; associated with bankruptcy filing) impacts directors’ professional devaluation in terms of their board appointments in the post-bankruptcy period. We also examine the impact of layered stigma, which exists when directors carry both the stigma of incompetence and courtesy stigma by being present during the origination and filing of Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Our findings confirm that directors are treated differently by the elite labor market based on the types of stigmas they carry. Moreover, directors likely to be stigmatized as incompetent carried fewer board appointments than those with courtesy stigma or layered stigma."
2020,"Responding to expected rare events: The Civil Aviation Authority’s handling of Monarch's Collapse -- Organisational events are frequently categorised as common and expected or rare and unexpected. This polarisation ignores the existence of events which are rare and yet expected. These expected rare events may be easily definable but, for those which are clouded by uncertainty, developing specific response repertoires is prohibitively complex. Instead, organisations must rely upon generic response repertoires to manage such events, often entailing improvisation, as planning and action coalesce. I explore the link between organisational improvisation and expected rare events by studying the Civil Aviation Authority’s (CAA) handling of Monarch Airlines’ collapse into administration. Grounded in interview and archival data, my analysis reveals the CAA drew on its previous experiences of similar events to build capabilities (relational; resource; cognitive; behavioural) and devise a minimal structure. In order to successfully handle the ambiguities of the event, the organisation planned for improvisation by enabling individuals to draw upon these capabilities. My analysis subsequently reveals that adaptability and, thus, organisational resilience in the face of an expected rare event was enabled by allowing improvisation to occur."
2020,"New Perspectives on Exploration and Exploitation: When Learning Fast Is Superior to Slow Learning -- Many organizations employ algorithms that learn from their members and then shape the way these individuals learn. Nevertheless, decades of research on organizational learning suggests that imperfect learning algorithms could sustain suboptimal beliefs that trap organizations indefinitely. To study potential algorithmic learning traps, we solve the underexplored theoretical properties of the March 1991 mutual learning model and demonstrate the conditions under which individuals should trust learning algorithms' recommendations. Our results show that the received wisdom regarding the benefit of slow learning and diversity does not hold when algorithms cannot identity accurate beliefs but follow the majority. The presence of non-discerning or even manipulated algorithms suggests that individuals should learn fast instead of slow to reduce the chance that algorithms learn the wrong, misleading lessons that would otherwise diffuse and contaminate everyone. Our exploitation of the March model generates novel insights that are increasingly relevant, thus promoting the model's generalization and making its beauty more robust."
2020,"Surviving Bad Business Behavior: Network Stucture and Trust Penalty -- Sanctions against bad behavior vary greatly. Some wrongdoers are regarded as no longer trustworthy; others face only modest consequences. This study investigates how this difference can be explained. Using data on 384 people cited as being “difficult” contacts (“wrongdoers”) within networks of Chinese entrepreneurs who deemed them such (“accusers”), this study shows how social structure influences variation in the penalty in lost trust that wrongdoers pay. Controlling for personal attributes and the substance of the incident that led to the wrongdoer being deemed difficult, we find that trust in the wrongdoer decreases with network closure around the accuser. We also find that highly embedded wrongdoers “survive” the incident with smaller trust penalties. The counterintuitive conclusion is that whereas closed networks have ideal structural properties to detect and sanction malfeasance, closure around the wrongdoer protects the wrongdoer from severe consequences of bad behavior."
2020,"Playing with Trash: How Gamification Contributed to the Bottom-Up Institutionalization of Zero Waste -- The microfoundational turn in institutional theory has focused on how mechanisms of institutionalization at different levels of analysis are intertwined. However, how social actors can more specifically incentivize and motivate individuals to engage in a new practice, ultimately triggering institutionalization, remains to be studied. From individual engagement to institutionalization, trickling-up mechanisms from micro- to macrolevels of practice engagement are not fully understood. To empirically address those questions, we investigate, across eight local communities, how authorities convinced households to adopt innovative waste management practices using gamification—the application of game principles to nongaming contexts. We draw on rich longitudinal qualitative material including interviews, observation, and secondary data, to give voices to multiple stakeholders. Our empirical design includes a variety of stakeholders: from those who promote the practice, to those who engage with it. We inductively build a multilevel model explaining how gamification can lead, from the bottom up, to the institutionalization of new practices. We flesh out the role of game mechanics in pushing individuals to adopt and spread the practice through their groups and communities and become themselves advocates of the emerging institution."
2020,"Learning paradox: Antecedents and mechanisms of paradox mindset development -- As organizations face persistent, contradictory demands, the individual managerial ability to manage such paradoxes is highly relevant for organizational viability. While research in this area is generally scarce, the newly introduced construct of paradox mindset describes lasting interindividual differences in the ability to manage paradoxical tensions. We build on psychological mindset theory to formulate a socio-psychological model of paradox mindset development to clarify the antecedents of this crucial construct for the first time. Based on primary data from 199 employees of two Central European companies, we find strong support for our model: Leadership behaviors in line with our theoretical influence angles predict higher paradox mindset in followers, and this effect is fully mediated through follower`s engagement in paradoxical tasks."
2020,"He's overqualified, she's highly committed: Gender, Qualifications, and Perceptions of Commitment -- Hiring managers make inferences from signals to determine if job candidates are capable and committed to performing the job to which they are applying to work. Building on how prior research has spoken about men in terms of their firm commitment and women in terms of their career commitment, we argue additional qualifications can be helpful for women in the labor market because they help overcome initial biases about women’s reduced career commitment, but hinder men’s outcomes because they heighten concerns about their firm commitment. To test our argument, we take a multi-methods approach combining four experiments and qualitative analysis. Results showed that while overqualified men were perceived to be less committed to the firm, and as a result, less likely to be hired, these same signals boosted women’s perceived firm commitment, career commitment, and hiring outcomes (Studies 1-3a). We provide additional evidence that gendered assumptions about the agency of the job candidate may further explain these differences (Studies 3a-b). This research highlights the importance of distinguishing between perceptions of firm and career commitment and contributes to the growing body of literature on the different challenges facing men and women in the labor market."
2020,"Not On Skid Row: Stigma Reduction In Addiction Treatment Organizations -- We studied the discursive processes through which core stigmatized organizations attempt to reduce their stigma by analyzing the websites of addiction treatment organizations. While it is well accepted that organizational stigma is socially constructed, there has not been much explicit attention to how language contributes to the construction, maintenance, and deconstruction of stigma. We contribute to the nascent literature on organizational destigmatization by focusing on the process through which stigma can be deconstructed through rhetoric. Based on our discursive findings, we theorize four ways that core stigmatized organizations can reduce their stigma: (1) Reconstructing the underlying cause of stigma; (2) Emphasizing similarities with social expectations; (3) Separating from stigma; (4) Collaborating with other actors in the field. In doing so, we contribute to the ongoing discussion of the relationship between stigma and legitimacy by showing how destigmatizing and legitimating tactics were intertwined."
2020,"Corporate Financialization and Executive Interlocks -- The financialization of US corporations has been well studied over the past decade. These accounts describe the accumulation of financial assets as a ubiquitous trend that touched all corners of organization populations. What is unknown, however, is how inter-organizational relations contributed to corporate financialization. Traditional theories afforded by research on board interlocks and isomorphism would suggest that focal firms financialized similarly as their interlocks. But more recent research suggests that a focal firm’s number of executive interlocks and the financial homogeneity of its board also played important roles in its financialization. My examination of S&P 1500 firms from 1996 to 2014 yields three important findings: First, focal firms indeed tended to financialize similarly to their interlocks, but (second) the financial homogeneity of those interlocks exacerbated their effects on the financialization of the focal firm. And third, boards seats filled by a greater proportion of executive directors limited the extent of the focal firm’s financialization."
2020,"Regulatory-Disrupting but Infrastructure-Freeing: Entrepreneurial Financing During the Arab Spring -- How do revolutions affect entrepreneurial financing? Prior studies argue that revolutions generate political uncertainty that decrease financing and that a more absent state breeds greater informality. However, the Arab Spring saw an increase in state financing actually, and these state institutions, rather than their absence, directly allocated such funding to informal firms. Using a novel dataset collected as the Arab Spring was occurring in Tunisia and Egypt, our study argues that prior work has predominantly focused on how revolutions erode state regulatory power (i.e., the degree to which the state can issue rules without consulting its citizenry). However, we argue that revolutions may also free state infrastructural power (i.e., the degree to which citizenry rely on state institutions for goods and services). More specifically, we find that firms founded during the revolution paid less in bribery payments (“regulatory-disrupting”), and informal firms received more of the state funding made available amidst the Arab Spring (“infrastructure-freeing”). In paying greater attention to state infrastructural power, this study brings greater nuance to how we understand the role of revolutions on entrepreneurial activity. More generally, this study heightens engagement of work in entrepreneurship with insights from political sociology."
2020,"Trapped in a community dilemma: The consequences of normalizing private social media use at work -- While previous research in the field of social media studies has primarily focused on enterprise social media and their implications for organizations, this paper examines a neglected and so far narrowly understood phenomenon: the illicit use of private social media in the workplace and its long-term consequences. I use an affordance perspective to explain how the illicit use of private social media became normalized through three interrelated mechanisms: collective rationalizing, team socializing, and individual strategizing. The distinct temporal interplay of these mechanisms produced unintended consequences and eventually trapped organizational members in a community dilemma. The contribution of this study is twofold. First, this paper shifts the debate from enterprise social media to private social media use in the workplace. This is important because the illicit and informal nature of private social media implies different consequences for organizations than enterprise social media use. Second, the findings of this study contribute to a better understanding of the dynamic interplay of affordances. As such, this study advances our knowledge how the affordances of social media can shift over time."
2020,"Exploring Temporality and Time Narratives: A case of UK Pension Funds’ Investment Strategies -- This inductive study of UK pension funds examines how pension fund trustees and their investment experts organize time and attend to the intertemporal tensions between the short- and long-term within investment strategies that are inherent to business and investment sustainability. Grounding our insights in theorization about time through narratives, we use insights from 22 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with pension fund trustees and their investment experts to highlight the significance of embedded legacy and path dependency by revealing how temporal frames of the past become embedded in the present and perpetuated into the future. We also find an intertemporal tension where pension fund trustees separate and favour short-term funding pressures at the expense of the long-term intergenerational equity. We argue that omission of the past and legacy from most strategic management continues to contribute to short-termism, which is the blight of sustainability. We conclude by drawing out some implications for policy and practice, as well as directions for further research."
2020,"The Process of Repairing Organizational Legitimacy -- This paper aims to explain the persistent legitimacy loss of a highly institutionalized organization by analyzing the process of failing legitimacy repair. Therefore, I reconstruct the prominent case of the State Office of Health and Social Affairs (LAGeSo) in Berlin, which became a symbol of authority failure during the ‘German refugee crisis’ in 2015. My findings show that whereas media triggers the organization to take action by attributing a need for change of the legitimacy object, they at the same time perceive the actual effects of these changes as an impediment of legitimacy repair. Using a paradox lens, I argue that these tensions of restructuring, cooperation and communication originate from the duality of legitimacy object and subject and are rendered salient through media’s paradoxical cognition. This contributes to our understanding of legitimacy repair in at least two ways: first, the revelation of a potential paradoxical downward spiral of legitimacy repair challenges the assumption that strategies of legitimacy repair mechanically produce desired outcomes; second, the paper contributes to the process perspective on legitimacy by revealing the fluid nature of the object of legitimacy, demanding for a more complex and dynamic lens when analyzing legitimacy processes."
2020,"Contextualizing Paradox Management: The Political Role of Coaching -- Paradox management is mostly attributed to individual abilities, such as cognitive or emotional abilities. This individual focus draws attention away from the role of context, overlooking how individuals think in relation with others and their environment. In particular, the political context of paradox management deserves more attention. Our research engages with this void by exploring how the political context of paradox management is shaped by coaching, a holding environment that potentially soothes tensions and facilitates paradox management. We conducted an inductive study of 57 semi-structured interviews with executive coaches using the critical incident technique. Our study shows that coaching shapes three different political contexts for paradox management, with distinctive holding units and holding functions. In doing so, it provides a dynamic approach to paradox management."
2020,"Towards an Untrepreneurial economy: The Entrepreneurship Industry and the Veblenian Entrepreneur -- What is driving the declining quality of innovation-driven entrepreneur-ship? In this paper, we argue the growing entrepreneurship industry is an important yet overlooked explanation. This rapidly growing industry has transformed the nature of entrepreneurship and encouraged a particular form of low-quality entrepreneurship. It has done so by leveraging the Ide-ology of Entrepreneurialism to mass-produce and mass-market products that make possible what we term Veblenian Entrepreneurship. This is en-trepreneurship pursued primarily as a form of conspicuous consumption. Aside from lowering average entrepreneurial quality, Veblenian Entrepre-neurship has a range of (short-run) positive and (medium and long-run) negative effects for both individuals and society at large. We argue that the rise of the Veblenian Entrepreneur has contributed to creating an increas-ingly Untrepreneurial Economy. That is an economy which superficially appears innovation-driven and dynamic, but is actually rife with ineffi-ciencies and unable to generate economically meaningful growth through innovation."
2020,"The Conceptual Future of Foresight: Rethinking Foresight as an Emergent Process -- Strategic foresight, as the capacity to recognize emerging environmental changes, is increasingly viewed as a distributed capability comprising multiple internal as well as external agents on different organizational levels. This recent turn towards more distributed and open approaches of strategic foresight, however, lacks a common theoretical foundation as scholars draw on different perspectives in their explanations. In light of this, the current paper conceptualizes the notion of foresight-as-emergence by drawing on and synthesizing insights from a practice lens and complexity theory. The integrative framework of foresight-as-emergence unpacks the concept of foresight space, linking the dynamics of how new insights into the future evolve from organization members’ everyday situated practices (i.e., local emergence) with the processes of how they become dispersed and adjusted throughout the organization (i.e., global emergence). In doing so, the framework provides a theoretical foundation for strategic foresight in high-velocity environments comprising both micro and macro levels."
2020,"From fringe to focal: How framing facilitates sustained increases in issue salience -- Why do some social issues remain salient over long periods while others fail to do so? We explore this question through a longitudinal qualitative study of the issue of economic inequality in discourse about capitalism. We find that an issue’s salience is impacted by the interplay of three key framing dimensions—axiological, causal, and ontological. We demonstrate how framing contests and their resolution related to these three dimensions unfold over time, and show how each provides a key link towards shaping how the issue is perceived, thereby facilitating changes in salience. Further, we show how the resolution of framing contests is informed by discursive resources in the broader cultural and political context that make some framings more resonant than others. In delineating this process, our study advances research on the dynamics of issues in organizational fields, interactional perspectives on framing, and social movements."
2020,"Does Nationalist Rhetoric Help Politicians Raise Campaign Contributions? -- Although research has paid significant attention to organizational reactions to formal political pressures, it remains to be understood how organizations react to political influence that is wielded through informal institutions. We argue that regulatory constraints on formal institutions increase political attention to informal institutions: social norms that facilitate the trading of favors. Politicians elicit informal favors from organizations through the use of nationalistic rhetoric. However, the social nature of informal institutions makes political influence more critical for firms that are strongly embedded in the local environment, yielding a distinction between the responses of domestic and foreign firms. A longitudinal state-wise examination of 476 firms in India showed that when institutional formalization encouraged political contests, there was an increase in corporate campaign contributions. This increase corresponded to politicians’ use of nationalistic rhetoric. While the rhetoric contributed to domestic firm contributions, foreign firms that were politically more engaged in the past became relatively insignificant. These findings highlight how informal institutions facilitate political influence on organizations, and in turn, how organizations inadvertently reinforce social fractures that redefine those very institutions."
2020,"Strangers at the Bedside: Subaltern Solidarities and New Form Institutionalization -- In this study, we examine how socially subordinated — or subaltern— actors may organize with dominant actors to create and institutionalize a new organizational form that addresses a complex social problem. Drawing on an in-depth qualitative study of the emergence and subsequent institutionalization of a community form for palliative care in Kerala, a southern Indian state, we delineate subaltern solidarity-making as a generative mechanism underpinning new form institutionalization. Specifically, dominant and subaltern actors constituted mutual recognition, reconfigured spatial relations, and built accountability into communities to institutionalize the new form. These relational and spatial processes of solidarity-making shift theorizing from prevailing accounts that emphasize conflict and contestation in political processes, to a generative engagement with heterogeneity in form institutionalization. We discuss contributions to research on new organizational forms addressing complex social problems and subaltern tactics in institutional processes."
2020,"From sonnets to statistics: How open scientists leverage occupational heterogeneity for change -- Occupations and their transformation have received only little attention in research on open organizing. To address this shortcoming, we advance a vernacular view on openness and use it to empirically examine how the open science community in Germany addresses a typical challenge of occupational change: occupational heterogeneity. We deepen current understandings of open organizing by theorizing the vernacular lens as a complement to the programmatic and constitutive views. It allows us to analyze openness as a practical resource for organizing rather than as a mandated principle or an imprinted value. We further theorize identity inception work as a set of activities that facilitate peer-driven change in heterogeneous occupations. Identity inception work creates a supplementary and versatile “add-on” identity that can be easily attached on top of a primary identity as specialist in a sub-discipline of academia, but in subtle ways commits its carriers to an increasing number of open practices."
2020,"Responsible Leadership: An Emergentist Perspective -- We studied the situated nature of the emergence of responsible leadership. Drawing on an emergentist perspective (Elder-Vass, 2005, 2008; Lawson, 2012), our analysis of observational and interview data in three organizations shows how responsible leadership emerges as participants’ ‘shared concerns’, which are embedded in existing relations that give meaning to what is responsible and possible. In contrast to previous research, we show how relationality, in addition to individual moral duty, shape the emergence of responsible leadership. Our qualitative study shows how practical forms of responsible leadership emerge from four distinct types of shared and nested concerns of the study participants. We contribute to the theory on the emergence of responsible leadership by unpacking how the socio- relational context shapes leadership responsibility."
2020,"Becoming an Institutional Entrepreneur: How Identity Shapes Change Agents' Ability and Motivation -- Institutional entrepreneurs are actors who play a leading role in establishing or changing institutions. They gather support for a vision of change when ambiguous field characteristics are prevalent, such as during institutional contradictions. Existing research conceptualizes institutional entrepreneurs as heroes who appear from nowhere to change the world, and sheds little light on the formative factors in their identity. Therefore, I applied a phenomenological methodology to study the experiences of select institutional entrepreneurs and compared these with that of actors who did not act as institutional entrepreneurs in similar situations. I found that institutional entrepreneurs had developed an identity with certain values as a reaction to crucial experiences during their first socialization. In line with their values, they had embraced various institutional contradictions throughout their lives and thus developed skills that enabled them to initiate institutional entrepreneurship. Additionally, their early established identities influenced their motivation to respond to prevalent institutional contradictions by realizing their key values during opportunities for change. The findings reveal that institutional entrepreneurs are disembedded actors only when seen from the outside: from their own perspective, they legitimize their behavior vis-à-vis their past experiences. This insight contributes to the debate on the paradox of embedded agency."
2020,"Contested Ideological Imprinting: State, Family Reading, and Entrepreneurship in Post-Mao China -- We theorize the contested process of ideological imprinting. We argue that ideological imprinting tends to be both hierarchical and sequential, and whether organizational imprinters can effectively buffer against the penetration of societal imprinters depends on the temporal order of the latter. Empirically, we study how family books reading at adolescence buffers the pre-Mao cohort and Mao cohort against the communist ideological imprinting during the Mao China (1949-1978), and subsequently shapes their entry into private entrepreneurship in the post-1978 reform era. We find that family reading atmosphere at adolescence was more effective in mitigating the negative effect of the communist state ideology on the pre-Mao cohort’s than the Mao cohort’s post-1978 entrepreneurial entry. Our study shows that incongruent alternative values of individuals—once successfully imprinted—mitigate the effect of a dominant societal ideology, generating heterogeneous effects on organizational behavior. Implications for research on imprinting analysis, values and entrepreneurship, and entrepreneurship in post-communist societies are outlined."
2020,"Digital Curation as a Catalyst for Open Organizing: Brokering Meaning, Relationships, and Emotion -- While a rich body of scholarship illuminates the inherent conflict and paradoxes of open organizing and open strategy processes, how low-power actors might advance open organizing to exert control over their organization’s strategic decisions remains a black box. In this paper, I present findings from an inductive study of 40,000 social media posts and comments from the Save Market Basket Facebook page to develop a theory of digital curation—how actors leverage their brokerage role to select and interpret digital material (e.g., digital videos, online news reports, others’ social media contribution, emails, etc.) to shape meaning, relationships, and emotion among disconnected parties. My paper 1) contributes to scholarship on open organizing and brokering by illuminating how digital curation of meaning, relationships, and emotion enables low-power individuals to advance open organizing and exert control over strategic decisions affecting their organizations; 2) illuminates how contests over meaning and control in open organizing are navigated through digital curation; and 3) provides insight to the role of emotion in both the brokerage and open organizing literatures."
2020,"Serendipity and Framing in the emergence of a platform for responsible innovation -- Why would an academic research project turn into a platform for responsible innovation despite incentives to focus on publishing research papers? To address this puzzle, we draw on the case of Patient Innovation, a non-profit medical platform, focusing on innovations by patients and caretakers to find affordable solutions for rare and chronic diseases by creating a ‘knowledge commons’. Initially set up as a ‘research platform’ aimed at generating scientific publications, it turned into a ‘help-society platform’ to create a wider social impact, despite not initially targeting such a goal. Using a framing lens, we explore the role of moral emotions and serendipitous inspiration in the creation of this medical platform. We examine how the reframing towards socially responsible innovation occurred despite strong institutional pressure to focus on publishing scientific research. In doing so, we develop a model illustrating how interactional framing in situations lead actors to shift towards responsible innovation. We explain how actors frame and reframe situations in which they interact and transcend their immediate self-interests in order to serve collective interests."
2020,"From taking to shaping – Why temporal tensions matter for organizations -- In this paper, we advance the notion of temporal tensions by building on three time-related constructs that address how individuals perceive and think about time: temporal depth, temporal focus, and urgency. Our focus lies on how actors shape and embrace temporal tensions on multiple levels within and outside the organization. Embracing such temporal tensions enables actors to understand the nestedness of conflicting goals, change temporal structures, and to focus their attention on urgent issues in the organization and in the social, ecological, and economic environment. We inform research on time in organizations by advancing the notion of temporal tensions and by emphasizing their multi- and cross-level nature. We contribute to research on tensions and paradoxes in organizations by conceptualizing tensions as the result of different stimuli and of an actor’s cognition. Lastly, we also contribute to research on temporality by bridging the subjective and objective notion of time in temporal tensions."
2020,"Orchestrating Interstitial Networks: Dynamics of High-potential, Low-expectation Collaboration -- Network orchestrators try to mobilize value for and from networks by recruiting network members and purposefully shaping their interactions to foster collaborative outcomes. While the activities of such actors have been assessed in dynamic settings in which network members participate on a full-time basis, orchestrators may find themselves in networks where members are engaged as a low-commitment side activity, which, nevertheless, might turn out to be highly important for them. We introduce the concept of interstitial networks to denote such settings and explore how orchestrators in these networks perform their role. We find specific dilemmas orchestrators face in these settings, as well as three orchestrating practices for navigating them: 1) probing themes and partners, 2) adapting orchestration timelines and activities, and 3) experimenting with interaction formats. Our findings highlight the mutually reinforcing relationship between orchestrating practices and the manifestation of interstitial elements in networks. Moreover, we show the experimental and collective character of orchestrating interstitial networks."
2020,"Knowing Your Place: Place-claiming, -reimagining, and Institutional Change -- Drawing from the theories of institutional work and place, we investigate how community organisations react to the loss of place meaning during incremental institutional change. Situating our inquiry in 41 community organisations in the United Kingdom that formerly were financially supported by a central organisation but now are expected to generate their own income, this novel context enabled us to investigate how community organisations seek to invoke and preserve tangible and intangible dimensions of place at the same time as diversifying place-based activities. We introduce the construct of place-claiming to explain how community organisations imbue place with prior physical, cultural, personal, and sensory attachments; and reimagining place to describe the influence of place-claiming on place change. Since reimagining place is layered onto place-claiming, our analysis also comments on institutional layering."
2020,"Truly Trustworthy or Simply Strategic? An Examination of Strategic Generosity in the Trust Game -- The importance of trust and reciprocity in facilitating mutually beneficial exchange has long been recognized. However, research suggests that the development of trust and reciprocity may be challenging if the actions are considered to be strategically rather than intrinsically motivated. This paper investigates whether initial acts of generosity impact the emergence of trust and reciprocity across strategic and non-strategic settings. Results suggest that when generosity can be perceived as being strategic it induces less trust. As a result, our research suggests that strategic considerations can have a detrimental effect on welfare: earnings within equivalent trust games are lower in the strategic than in the non-strategic condition. Importantly, the observed generosity does not appear to have been strategic. Rather, it appears that simply the perception of strategic motivation is enough to reduce subsequent trust. On the other hand, we also observe that those subjects who acted more selfishly display significantly more reciprocity in the non-strategic relative to the strategic setting. This behavior appears consistent with moral balancing."
2020,"“Category Thickness”: Descriptive and Evaluative Ambiguities as Determinants of Strategic Category -- Research in market categories and in social evaluations underline that market actors use categories as strategic tools and that strategic categorization implies a certain degree of categorical ambiguity. While research on categories have mostly focused on the ambiguity regarding the category’s meaning, or the “descriptive ambiguity”, an overlooked dimension explaining strategic categorization is the ambiguity regarding the category’s valence, or the “evaluative ambiguity”. In philosophy, the categories that mix descriptive and evaluative ambiguities are called “thick”, as opposed to “thin” that are either purely descriptive or purely evaluative. This conceptual paper studies how the combination of descriptive and evaluative ambiguities explains producers’ strategic category affiliation. In doing so, it offers contributions in research on market categories and social evaluations."
2020,"Two Faces of Cultural Products: A Behavioral Understanding of Artistic and Commercial Success -- How organizations, including project-based organizations (PBOs), pursue multiple goals is a central theme in research on the behavioral theory of decision making. We develop two competing approaches, balanced and imbalanced, to understand the responses of PBOs. The balanced approach suggests that PBOs may simultaneously achieve multiple performance goals, whereas the imbalanced approach contends that organizations can only focus on one goal at the expense of the other. We then identify a series of boundary conditions, including individual factors (i.e., leadership capacity) and organizational factors (i.e., interorganizational collaboration and resources), which may help organizations balance multiple goals. We examined our theory in the context of the Chinese film industry, where artistic acclaim and commercial success are both important performance goals. We found negative relationships between artistic acclaim and commercial success of films, supporting the imbalanced approach. Our three boundary conditions under which PBOs may pursue the balanced approach are also largely supported. Our study contributes to the behavioral theory of decision making and provides important implications for managers."
2020,"Firms of Endearment: Organizational Imprinting in Business Ecosystems -- Business ecosystems have been advanced as an analytical lens for studying multilateral arrangements of firms that span industries and in which the boundaries between competition and collaboration are unclear. A key construct in the ecosystem literature is the complementor. These are firms that, while not formally connected to a focal firm, provide services that are necessary for the focal firm’s value to be realized by consumers. While the literature has emphasized the tensions faced by a focal firm as it attempts to align the efforts of its complementors to its value proposition, however, these studies have tended to take a static view of this phenomenon: they haven’t considered how a focal firm’s past decisions of which complementor firms to engage impact their ability to engage with successive complementors in the future. Moreover, the literature on ecosystems has viewed complementors as fungible. As a result, we still lack an understanding of how a focal firm’s choices of complementors over time impact the evolution of an ecosystem. This paper contributes to the ecosystems literature by building theory that foregrounds the role of complementors in the development of business ecosystems and by responding to calls for an inter-temporal perspective on ecosystem evolution."
2020,"Paradox Intensification: Navigating coopetition in industry-wide alliance formation -- Organizations increasingly collaborate with competitors to advance technology, build industry ecosystems and address grand challenges. However, the tensions between cooperation and competition foster ongoing challenges that thwart the success of these important initiatives. We offer new insights to unpack the nature and management of coopetition challenges by applying paradox theory to rich data from the formation of a cooperative alliance addressing industry threats by environmental activists in one of the most competitive industries, the Alberta oil sands. Our in-depth analysis of the formation of this industry alliance over three years reveals a model of paradox intensification. Whereas scholars have described how challenges of navigating such paradoxical tensions diminish over time, we find the opposite. As the collaboration grew in scale and in specificity, the tensions between collaborating and competing grew in quantity and challenge. We find that in addition to requiring formal structures, effectively addressing such intensifying paradoxical tensions required informal interactions by individuals, who we describe as champions, who built the alliance through fostering personal relationships and trust. This model of paradoxical intensification advances the growing literature on the paradoxes of coopetition by unpacking the challenges and responses to navigating the tensions between cooperation and competition over time."
2020,"How Constituents Evaluate Configurations of Status and Conformity -- Recent management research on institutional pluralism has surfaced that today’s organizations typically face multiple – oftentimes competing - institutional expectations. Despite this recognition, research on institutional pluralism remains circumscribed in two important ways: First, the existing literature typically assumes that pluralistic organizations straddle two sets of competing expectations, rarely more. Second, competing expectations are represented and evaluated by discrete sets of constituents with unidimensional expectations, for example when investors only evaluate financial aspects, and environmentalists only environmental aspects of firms. Examples that challenge these two assumptions abound, for instance when impact investors evaluate firms holistically based on their financial, environmental, and social performance. Where individual constituents have those multidimensional expectations, we argue, they holistically evaluate how organizations conform with multiple, interdependent expectations. Yet, such configurational approaches to evaluating pluralist organizations are currently absent from the literature. To address this gap, we conducted a fuzzy-set configurational analysis of 117 international business schools to uncover the configurations through which prospective students evaluate how MBA programmes conform with their expectations. Based on our analysis, we make three contributions to the literature on institutional pluralism. First, we explain how organizations are evaluated holistically as configurations of multiple interdependent, rather than independent expectations represented by individual constituents. Second, by doing so we add to current accounts of institutional outcomes. We extend current, binary accounts of the existence or demise of pluralist organizations to consider social evaluations as a more nuanced outcome of pluralism. Third, we provide new insights about how configurations of conformity and status interact in producing holistic evaluations in the context of institutional pluralism."
2020,"Nexus Theory as a New Perspective of the Management Norm -- It was recently argued that an ethically-complete normative theory of the firm requires a vision of a “nexus of imperfect duty” that complements the contractual vision of Coase, i.e. the latter being a nexus of perfect duty. It is shown here that this complete normative vision provides the foundation for an insightful explanation of the evolutionary development of the management team. This evolution is founded on an extension of the “unity theory” of virtue ethics as applied to the management team in the form of a “balanced development” theory. The impetus for this managerial team evolution is the maintenance of a type of balance in the nexus of dispositions towards imperfect duty (or virtues) as the unity theory suggests for the virtues of individuals. Methods for reinforcing this balanced evolution are also reviewed here. This nexus of imperfect duty approach poses an ethical norm for management that offers a fresh vision for managerial theory and analysis. It organizes insights into the interrelatedness of management functions, and the development of the managerial team. In this imperfect duty context, firm development is shown to be built upon efforts that “go beyond” expectations of management creativity."
2020,"When Institutional Factors Matter Most: Cross-National Variation in Disaster Risk Reduction Planning -- In this study, we show that institutional influences are stronger than technical ones in predicting the cross-national diffusion of standards on disaster preparedness. We examine the adoption of the first global disaster risk reduction standard, the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA), in 186 countries from 2005-2015. Although practical accounts emphasize the technical benefits of the framework in mitigating potential harm and damage, surprisingly, these explanations do little to explain country-level adoption – even when a nation has recently experienced a disaster. Thus, we test and find strong support for an alternative explanation, which draws on the influence of organizational sociology: that institutional influences are the primary driver diffusion of global standards. Specifically, the enduring effects of historical legacies play a particularly important role in adoption. Taken together, our results suggest that preparedness against natural disasters is a culturally mediated practice. A practical implication of our work is that many of the countries most in need of disaster preparedness may, at present, be the least prepared."
2020,"A Contingency Model of The Effectiveness of Impression Management Tactics -- This paper proposes a contingency model showing the effectiveness of two types of impression management tactics when implemented in market categories with differing degrees of categorical stigma. Specifically, we investigate ego centric tactics (those that center on member specific information) and alter centric tactics (those that use information about others), and explore the mechanisms – related to the risk of perceived manipulation – that determine their effectiveness under environments characterized by different levels of stigma. Using a large dataset covering the US food retail industry between 2006 and 2015, we find that ego centric tactics are more effective when implemented in categories that exhibit low rather than high levels of stigma. Conversely, we find that alter centric tactics are more effective in highly stigmatized categories, as opposed to categories displaying low levels of stigma. Our study highlights the strategic role of impression management in aiding category members to instrumentally position themselves in the competitive space and contributes to the research debates on impression management in contested settings and stigma management strategies."
2020,"Falling down or bouncing back:a two-stage, dual-path organizational learning process after failure -- Research demonstrates that experiences of failure can have positive and negative effects on a firm’s subsequent behavior and performance. This contradictory finding necessitates in-depth exploration on the mechanisms behind failure-related performance change. The purpose of this study is to fill this gap by disaggregating the postfailure learning process into “falling down” and “bouncing back” paths and addressing their relative effects on organizational performance in an integrated framework. We test our arguments in the context of a computer-based strategic business simulation. We repeatedly collect survey data from 144 teams in an executive education program during 2016-2018. Our study contributes to the literature on organizational learning from failure in three dimensions. First, we develop a comprehensive model by integrating macro and micro perspectives. Specifically, we advance our understanding of a firm’s subsequent reactions to failure through its micro-foundation rooted in top management team (TMT) dynamics. Second, our findings indicate that organizational learning from failure involves two stages, namely chaos stage and reassembly stages. Finally, we reveal that the severity of failure amplifies both falling down and bouncing back effects on organizational performance change. From our findings, we draw implications for organizations to facilitate effective learning from failure."
2020,"A New Look at Occupational Learning and Socialization in Contemporary Careers -- As the traditional employment relationship has deteriorated in the U.S. and in much of the world, the nature of careers has been changing. Workers today need to continually navigate an external labor market, construct their careers out of a series of jobs or short-term gigs, and take responsibility for training and retraining themselves to remain employable over time. Despite the burgeoning literature examining workers’ efforts at navigating the new economy, we know relatively little about how workers attempt to reskill themselves in the course of their careers. This paper utilizes a unique setting—coding bootcamps—to examine how workers attempt to enter a skilled occupation without traditional organizations serving as the backdrop for their efforts. I argue that bootcamps resembled learning collectives where learning from peers and near-peers figured more prominently than expert instruction. Under conditions of minimal expert instruction and obstacles to legitimate peripheral participation, I show how aspiring software developers sought out an occupational community in virtual spaces, learned asynchronously from unknown others, developed their practice through mock-work among themselves and managed to get hired into junior developer roles."
2020,"Organizational response to shortfalls: The role of decision makers’ self-confidence and time slack -- The behavioral theory of the firm (BTOF) states that performance shortfalls trigger organizational responses seeking to restore performance above the aspiration level. However, previous research has shown weak support for this proposition. One explanation for this lack of support is optimistic performance assessments: Performance shortfalls might not be perceived as problematic by decision makers, which leads them to underestimate the need for a response. In this paper, I argue that decision makers’ self-confidence promotes optimistic interpretations of performance assessments when performance is ambiguous enough. However, when performance shortfalls are unambiguous, I predict that decision makers’ self-confidence leads to the opposite consequence, strong organizational responses, due to risk-seeking behavior. In addition, in this paper I propose that organizational slack is a source of ambiguity in performance assessments allowing for favorable interpretations. Particularly, I propose that decision makers prone to make optimistic performance assessments overestimate the value they can extract from slack, which leads them to underestimate the need for a response to performance shortfalls. I find support for my hypotheses by analyzing 101,146 first down decisions from the National Football League (NFL) between seasons 2009 and 2016."
2020,"Evaluator Status and its Effect on Gender Bias in Evaluations -- There is consistent evidence that women are disadvantaged in evaluations, with women receiving worse evaluations than similar men. However, there has been less discussion and evidence regarding the mechanisms that attenuate or exacerbate this bias. We draw on status theory to discuss whether evaluators who gain status will exhibit less gender bias in their evaluations. Specifically, we argue that status attainment has a disciplining effect thus reducing observed gender bias in evaluations. We use the presence of close-to-random allocation of servers to customers in the restaurant industry and evaluations on the digital platform Yelp to test this theory. In aggregate, we find a systemic gender bias in restaurant reviews: When evaluators report having a female (versus male) server they rate the restaurant significantly lower than its average rating to date, however, this gap is reduced by more than half after an evaluator gains status."
2020,"Entrepreneurial Clustering and the Development of Positive Psychological Capital -- In this paper, I explore the core idea that geographical clustering may provide entrepreneurs with psychological benefits - a type of benefit that is not yet recognized in the literature on clusters. Specifically, I develop a theoretical model along with testable propositions where I argue that entrepreneurial clusters have the potential to develop into ‘communities’ which provide clustered entrepreneurs with varying degrees of psychological sense of community. A strong psychological sense of community in turn helps entrepreneurs develop positive psychological capital through processes of social comparison, social influence, perceived social support, increased participation inside the cluster community, and emotional sustenance. Higher levels of positive psychological capital helps entrepreneurs deal with the psychological pressures associated with starting and managing a small business and thereby leads to improved venture performance, albeit up to a threshold level of psychological capital after which higher levels of psychological capital may hurt venture performance. Contributions to the literatures on clusters, entrepreneurship, and psychological capital are discussed."
2020,"The Perception and Evaluation of Founder Experience by Hiring Firms: A Field Experiment -- Founding one’s own venture is often seen as desirable; however, most entrepreneurs must subsequently enter wage employment. Although a transition to wage employment is common, it remains unclear how founder experience is perceived and evaluated by recruiters at hiring firms. We argue that current theory can be used to make a strong case for founder experience as an asset as well as a liability to hiring firms. We first discuss the advantages and disadvantages of founder experience for wage employment and then test these theories through a field experiment, namely a resume audit study. Specifically, we test how those who started their career as founders fare relative to those who started their career as wage employees at the initial evaluation stage of the hiring process: receiving a callback for an interview. We find that former founders receive fewer callbacks than non-founders; however, all founders are not disadvantaged similarly. Former founders of successful ventures receive even fewer callbacks than former founders of failed ventures. Through 20 interviews with technical recruiters we highlight the mechanisms driving this founder experience discount: concerns related to the applicant's capability and ability to fit into and remain committed to the wage employment and the hiring firm. We also investigate three sources of heterogeneity: applicant gender, hiring firm age, and job location."
2020,"Can I Survive or Will I Survive: Mechanisms Linking Network Structures of Managers & Store Survival -- In the existing survival literature, a fundamental and important question is why some firms survive but others fail. By integrating a motivation-ability perspective and social network theory, we develop a novel model to examine the process mechanisms of the job satisfaction and creativity of store managers in linking relationships between their network advantages, namely, centrality and brokerage, and store survival. Our findings suggest that the centrality of store managers exerts a positive effect on their job satisfaction; brokerage, their creativity. The job satisfaction and creativity of store managers are important mediators. Job satisfaction mediates the relationship between the centrality of store managers and store survival, and creativity mediates that between the brokerage of store managers and store survival. Our study provides meaningful theoretical contributions and managerial implications."
2020,"Mind and Matter: The Coevolution of Technology and Institutional Logic in Field Transformation -- Research examining field level transformation is generally fragmented into literature either focusing on patterns of change in the socio-cognitive evolution of institutional logic or in the materiality of technological innovations. We seek to bridge these growing, but largely independent streams of inquiry by developing a co-evolutionary model where logic construction and technological innovation interact to escalate or constrain field level transformation. We first synthesize institutional logic and technological transition literatures into a compatible framework with complementary stages across de-institutionalization and re-institutionalization. Drawing on several historical examples, we then build propositions to explain how socio-cognitive and technological change pathways interact with each other enable or constrain field transformation. Our co-evolutionary theory of field transformation bridges disparate literatures examining a common phenomenon and advances understanding of factors driving the pace and scope of field transformation."
2020,"The Exchange, Formalization, and Implementation of Meaning in Sensemaking Conflicts -- This paper draws on previous sensemaking and sensegiving research in an attempt to explain how repeated situations of competing understandings around issues could lead to a catastrophic outcome. We provide insights to this question by drawing on qualitative data from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster. We analyze four critical events (i.e., sensemaking conflicts) that took place during the months leading up to the disaster. These events have in common that 1) multiple understandings existed as to how the event should be dealt with; and, 2) action was required to overcome the event and proceed with the operations. Our findings suggest that these sensemaking conflicts were solved through a three-stage sensegiving process consisting of meaning exchange, meaning formalization, and meaning implementation, where organizational systems and procedures were used as devices to strengthen the effectiveness of sensegiving. We also suggest that access to such devices varied between organizational members, thereby creating a disadvantage for some of the members to successfully transmit their understanding to others. We propose that the recurrence of these sensemaking conflicts and their interconnectedness led the decision-makers to vastly underestimate the riskiness of the situation, thereby contributing to the occurrence of the disaster."
2020,"Temporal Distinction of Multiple Goals and Effects on Strategic Risk-Taking -- Organizational goals play a central role in driving firm decision making. The behavioral theory of the firm conceptualizes goals as situational aspirations that guide organizational adaptation through performance feedback. However, this aspiration-directed logic implicitly assumes the short-term orientation of decision makers, while the effect of long-term strategic goals on firm decision making is less explored. Our study focuses on long-term strategic goals, which, we argue, influence firm decision making through decision makers’ commitment. Borrowing insights from strategic communication research, we conceptualize strategy specificity to capture decision makers’ commitment to strategic goals and theorize its implications for firm strategic risk-taking. Additionally, we examine the interactive effects of strategy specificity and performance feedback on strategic risk-taking, with contingencies of managerial discretion and board shareholding. Using panel data on 1,074 Chinese listed firms in manufacturing industries, we find that firms with higher strategy specificity engage in more strategic risk-taking. However, this behavioral tendency is weakened when firms receive strong negative or positive performance feedback. Moreover, we find that the moderating effect of performance feedback on strategy specificity is enhanced by managerial discretion but mitigated by board shareholding."
2020,"Public Enemies: Reputation, Celebrity, and Scandalizing Organizational Misconduct -- Considering that scandals result from the disruptive publicity of transgressions, we examine how social evaluations such as reputation and celebrity influence why some transgressions are publicized and not others. Extending current knowledge about the effects of social evaluations on publicity, we argue that while reputation and celebrity burden firms by directing media attention to their transgressions, the sociocognitive content of these evaluations further provides nuances into how different transgressions are scandalized differently. Because of audiences’ tendencies towards rational and deliberate information processing when evaluating high-reputation firms, reputation attracts significant publicity to a transgression due to the transgression’s high relevance to firms’ value creation potentials. In contrast, while celebrity also attracts publicity due to its emotion-laden sociocognitive content calling for the media’s attention to the emotionally devastating nature of transgressions, it also interferes with the media’s processing of transgression characteristics (e.g., severity and recency) as to amplify the impact of the characteristics when they fit the emotional frame of celebrity, and attenuate when not, on the media’s publicizing decision. We tested our arguments in the context of data breaches involving publicly traded U.S. companies."
2020,"A theory of non-hierarchical organizational growth -- We propose a theory that explains when an organization can grow in size without increasing the extent of managerial hierarchy. We formulate a computational model in which the number of layers of managers required for a given number of producers depends critically on how production is organized. However, the distinctive feature of our approach is that we conceptually separate the organization design of production activities from the shape of the managerial hierarchy. The central insight is that, the localization of conflicts between teams is an effective approach to keeping managerial hierarchies flat than modularizing work within teams or creating non-hierarchical teams per-se. Our model also offers insights about how the initial decisions of division of labor that founders make impact the scalability of managerial hierarchy."
2020,"Attention Disorders and Attention Mismanagement in Organizations -- Advancing the attention-based view (ABV) of the firm, we examine the four attention disorders (ADs) in organizations: cognitive myopia, cognitive hyperopia, cognitive astigmatism, and cognitive presbyopia and their effect on attention mismanagement: focal, situational and structural. We also investigate ADs’ temporal, spatial, effectual and directional dimensions. Finally, we propose how organizations could combat ADs and their harmful effects."
2020,"Organizational Event Stigma: Typology, Processes, Stickiness -- What do events such as scandals, industrial accidents, activist threats, and mass shootings have in common? They can all potentially stigmatize the organization involved. Despite the prevalence of these stigma-causing events, management research has provided little conceptual work to characterize the nature and dimensions of organizational event stigma. This article takes the perspective of the audience to unpack the audience evaluation process that is triggered by these events, identify critical dimensions for categorizing types of event stigma, and explore the role of the stigmatizers, the stigmatized, and the bystanders in producing what we call “sticky stigmas.” We postulate that volitional and collateral event stigma are likely to lead to stigma stickiness. Our conceptual framework clarifies the antecedents and consequences of the different types of event stigma, highlights the importance of emotional evaluation, and opens avenues for further research into the role of diverse audiences in the stigmatization process."
2020,"You Jump, I Jump: A Bundle-based Perspective of Category Membership -- Extant studies in category research has increasingly focused on the horizontal structure of the category system and incorporated the interconnectedness between categories into their analyses. However, we know relatively little on different types of connections a category can build with other categories and to what extent different types of connections will affect a category’s usage in products. We argue that categories bundle together and form different clusters. We refer to a group of aggregated categories as “category bundle” in this paper. We argue that market participants (i.e., producers, audiences, and market intermediaries) are aware of category bundles, and they utilize the bundle-based approach in their evaluation of products. In this sense, not only the overall position of a category in the category system, but also a category’s fitness in the category bundle, affects its chances of appearing in the description of a product. We find support for the bundle-based perspective in our empirical analysis of feature films produced in Canada and the U.S. Our study enriches the understanding of the structure of category system and its impacts on the product market. We also provide a novel explanation on why category spanning remains ubiquitous although existing studies propose that category-straddling products are prone to be punished harshly."
2020,"Organizational redesign, knowledge transfer, and the formation of new boundary-spanning ties -- In this study we examine the interplay between change in formal structure and informal social networks within organizations. Drawing on social capital and social exchange theories, we derive hypotheses about how interaction between cohesion and diversity in personal advice networks that organizational participants maintain before an organizational redesign affects their propensity to form boundary-spanning ties after it. We test our hypotheses using new data that we have collected within a large healthcare organization that has recently experienced a major organizational redesign and change. The results indicate that both cohesion and diversity of personal advice networks significantly affect the propensity of organizational participants to access knowledge across boundaries after a change in internal organizational structures and processes. In line with our hypotheses, the results also suggest that cohesion and diversity have opposite effects on the propensity of organizational participants to access knowledge across boundaries after the change depending on their dominant network role (sender or recipient) in the network of informal advice relations before the change. We discuss the implications of these findings for research on organizational change, knowledge transfer, and intra-organizational networks."
2020,"The Persistent Specialist Advantage: Typecasting Dynamics in Feature Films -- Whether to be a specialist or generalist is a long-standing question for job candidates. The extant literature argues that the excess returns to labor market specialization exists, and the returns will decrease as job market candidates climb the career ladder. Should the aforementioned argument be valid, a job candidate with a long tenure will avoid being specialized. This argument, nevertheless, is contradictory to an observation in the feature film labor market that the ratio of specialists is stable among job candidates across different career stages. We argue that considering the effects of external audiences on hiring decisions can help reconcile the classic argument with the observation. Specifically, we argue that specialist advantage may sustain among the specialists whose skills and ability are highly matched with their image among audiences. We use rich longitudinal data from 1990 to 2015 on the careers of 21,914 actors and actresses in English-speaking films to test our hypotheses. We find that the moderating effects of actors’ tenure on specialist advantage is contingent on their public image among audiences. For actors whose skills and public image are highly matched, a long tenure will not decrease, but enlarge their specialist advantage. Our research contributes to the labor market identity research by presenting hiring decisions as dual-matching processes in which both the hiring firms and external audiences are involved."
2020,"Organizing the Wisdom of Crowds: How Wikipedia Helps to Theorize and Legitimize the Blockchain -- Many new community-based organizations rely on the assumption that platform technology can aggregate judgements of their members into results which are better than individual judgements. This “wisdom of crowds” effect is typically explained by stochastic effects which erase individual psychological biases. We deviate from this psychic-stochastic explanation by highlighting the relevance of organizing and technology: When applying a sociological institutionalism perspective on knowledge production, it becomes clear that institutionalized processes like typification, abstraction, legitimation, and objectification are mechanisms of organizing everyday knowledge in communities that go beyond stochastic effects. When distinguishing technological layers of platforms, the relevance of organizing principles for specialization, variation, and generalization becomes visible. How everyday knowledge production and technological layers are intertwined is demonstrated by analyzing Wikipedia in general and the development of “Blockchain” on Wikipedia in particular. We reconstruct how a dynamic semantic network of legitimizing and de-legitimizing concepts evolves around Blockchain. There we observe how Bitcoin, which is surrounded by stigmatizing concepts, is generalized to Blockchain, which is free of stigma and becomes embedded into various knowledge domains. The empirical example demonstrates that platforms which support theorization processes can aggregate individual judgements to “wiser” results. With this research, we deepen the understanding of relational theorizing by highlighting the importance of legitimation and stigmatization within institutional analysis. Additionally, we revive the application of institutional analyses in the domain of technology studies."
2020,"Two Faces of Mental Representation And the Adaptive Implication of Their Joint Development -- Extant studies on the impact of mental representation on firms’ adaptation tend to emphasize either sensing or responding role of mental representation. The difference in the perspectives on mental representation gives rise to the puzzling effects of pursuing a representation that recognizes a wide range of factors and their interactions on the firm’s adaptiveness. This study addresses the puzzle by demonstrating the joint development of sensing and responding representations and articulating its adaptive implications. I employ a neural network model of a firm’s mental representation that consists of the sensing layer that reduces a given situation to decision factors and the responding layer that formulates the firm’s response to the decision factors. The results suggest a temporal trade-off of cultivating a complex sensing layer. Firms pursuing multiple objectives cultivate a complex sensing layer, which promotes their adaptation in the short run. However, in the long run, the complex sensing layer impedes the firms from formulating a proper rule to respond to the observed situation. This study extends our understanding of the role of mental representation in firms’ adaptation. Also, this study sheds light on the interdependence among firm objectives, which emerges and resides in firms’ cognition."
2020,"Value Co-Creation and Distribution: A Contingency View on the Effects of Financial Slack -- This study develops a theoretical perspective on inclusive processes of value co-creation and distribution contingent on the financial slack in the organizational system. By focusing on the economic and institutional costs of slack, as well as on its benefits to support economic exchanges with social dimensions, we propose an inverted U-shaped relationship between slack and the co-created value. We preview our argument by analyzing how slack sustained a collective decision-making process to plan a new national railway, albeit the dubitable social gains of the solutions achieved by consensus. We then draw on organization governance literature using new institutional economics to theorize empirical observables, and probe the slack-value relationship with a game theoretic model that holds constant the essence of the governance arrangement. We show the value-slack relationship is moderated by the accrual of benefits from a negotiated settlement: if the benefits are low, the co-created value is maximized by increasing slack up to the point that maximizes the capital provider’s share of value. If the benefits are high, the co-created value is maximized by increasing slack even more so as to maximize the enfranchised stakeholders’ share of value. We also show that, up to a point, increased slack widens the space of mutually acceptable solutions. Also, the effect of slack is steeper if the costs of slack can be reduced by making credible commitments today to mobilize more resources tomorrow."
2020,"Why so few? The gender representation gap in academic STEM fields, a system dynamics approach -- We use a simulation approach to study what factors influence the under-representation of women in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). In particular, we focus on understanding why, despite the increased representation of women in graduate programs and assistant professorship positions, we still observe a small proportion of women in tenured positions. To do so, we build a dynamic feedback model of women representation. According to the model, the gender representation gap – i.e., the lack of women in tenured professorship positions - is driven by gender bias and women’s perceptions of the workplace. We show that the behavior of this model is consistent with previous studies focusing on persistent gender gaps in knowledge-based organizations. Finally, we explore the behavior of the model under different experimental conditions."
2020,"The Doctor Will See You Elsewhere: Enterprise IS and the Changing Control of Firm Activities -- In this work, we examine how the adoption of enterprise information systems affects the ability of high agency organizational actors to control the activities performed by firms, including both what those activities are and where they are done. While extant research highlights the ability of managers to more carefully manipulate the activities performed by the firm when enterprise IT is adopted, work has yet to examine whether high agency subordinates will use such technology to appropriate rents. Empirically, we investigate whether surgeons reallocate patients to ambulatory care settings for treatment after the adoption of electronic health records (EHR). Findings suggest that while the adoption of basic EHR technology has limited effect, the adoption of advanced EHRs dramatically increases the number of patients treated in an ambulatory care setting. Interestingly, these relationships are strongly moderated by both the financial incentives of the physician and the profit motives of the hospital. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed within."
2020,"Communities of Practice as Bridges between Institutional Entrepreneurs and Frontline Practitioners -- This paper seeks to understand how new practices that challenge established norms and values become institutionalized by studying the development of corporate philanthropy in France over three decades (1979-2011). Our inductive qualitative study uncovers the processes that enable actors at both field and organizational levels to enhance a new practice’s internal and external legitimacy, ultimately leading to its institutionalization. In particular, we identify the central role of a community of practice as a bridge between the field-level, purposive interventions (theorizing, influencing policy) of an institutional entrepreneur and the organizational level, emergent interventions (mobilizing, embedding) of frontline practitioners experimenting with the new divergent practice, thereby enabling its legitimation and, ultimately, its institutionalization. As such, our findings contribute to refine our understanding of institutionalization processes as inherently distributed and to uncover communities of practice as the missing link between “heroic” entrepreneurs’ interventions and the hidden work of frontline practitioners implementing the new practice."
2020,"Org. Legitimation in a Polarized Media Landscape: The Role of Robust Org. Impression Management -- We conducted a longitudinal case study about the United States (U.S.) electronic vehicle manufacturer Tesla and its spokesperson Elon Musk to investigate how organizations can maintain organizational legitimacy through organizational impression management among a heterogeneous audience, as exemplified by the ideologically polarized U.S. media landscape. We uncovered that Tesla’s spokesperson, Elon Musk, mobilized two different types of what we refer to as ‘robust organizational impression management’ (i.e., chameleon and diplomacy strategies). The ‘chameleon strategy’ portrays Tesla as ideologically open and appeals to different, highly polarized audience demands, while the ‘diplomacy stratgy’ places Tesla in a diplomatic role that serves to de-polarize how the audience views the organization. Together, these strategies enabled Musk to both retain Tesla’s good relations with the leftwing media and to simultaneously reduce its illegitimacy among the rightwing media outlets. In this way, Tesla maintained its legitimacy among a highly heterogeneous audience. Our study contributes to the literatures on organizational legitimation, organizational impression management, robust action, and political ideology."
2020,"Network Structure, Actor Attributes, and Intraorganizational Knowledge Sharing -- How do the relational and structural characteristics of interpersonal networks affect knowledge sharing within organizations? And how are these effects, in turn, influenced by the personal attributes of the individual network members? To answer these questions, we focus on intraorganizational inventor networks and investigate how tie strength and structural holes influence two major dimensions of knowledge sharing, i.e., knowledge absorption and knowledge transfer. Then we consider the moderating effect of a crucial attribute of inventors, i.e., their status of star inventors. Drawing on patent data from 33 of the largest firms operating in the pharmaceutical industry worldwide during a 34-year time period, we show that both the average tie strength and the proportion of structural holes which characterize inventor networks exert an inverted U-shaped effect on both intraorganizational knowledge absorption and transfer by inventors, and that these four curves become flatten in the case of star inventors, when compared to inventors in general."
2020,"Sexy Work Not Sex Work: How Dirty Work Gets Clean -- Research on stigma is often divided between areas focusing on organizational stigma and job-based stigma, also known as dirty work. The dirty work literature has made strides in outlining the various ways in which dirty workers cope with stigma, but, unlike the organization stigma literature, has not elaborated de-stigmatization strategies. Drawing on interviews with 33 women working in the burlesque and stripping segments of the exotic dance industry, we explore how dirty work can get clean. Our findings reveal the ways in which the stigma of dirty work is not only attached to the work and workers, as existing literature suggests, but to the organizations it takes place in, and the associated audiences and scripts linked to these organizations. We show that by shifting out of stigmatized organizations, finding new audiences, and developing new scripts, actors without resources or power can shed the stigma of their work. Our findings thus enable us to link the dirty work literature to organizational stigma literature by pointing out the important ways in which they are related, and how dirty workers can clean their work without changing the primary elements of it."
2020,"How organizational change emerges from everyday work. The role of temporal nexus -- We address the puzzle of why some events of everyday activity in organizations generate organizational change, whereas others do not. Our study of ship design and construction company contributes to the understanding of how certain events of activity have a temporal orientation that enables them to be generative of organizational change. When comparing the temporal orientations of activities at different events we found that change was generated when the event (1) formed synergetic nexus between past and future activities; (2) combined a long temporal reach into past activities with immediate future application of ideas, which enabled actors to (3) project future activities that differed markedly from on-going activity. We develop the concept of “temporal nexus events” to explain how organizational change emerges through connecting dynamics at such events. We then extend our contribution further by showing how everyday activity at other events becomes vital support for the change process. We develop a model to explain how the two types of events of everyday activity interact in change processes."
2020,"Enduring Effects of Nationalistic Ideology on Strategy Formation Process: The Case of Nippon Gakki -- The enduring effect of the intense ideological experience of key organizational actors—top executives—on their subsequent strategic decisions is explored through a longitudinal archival case study of Nippon Gakki Ltd. (present-day Yamaha Corporation), a Japanese musical instrument manufacturer that pursued the motorcycle industry in the 1950s. An intense nationalistic ideology during WWII imprinted future top executives of Nippon Gakki, who, in the Post-WWII era, sought to expand their businesses driven by their imperative to pursue national prosperity and prestige. The ideology influenced three dimensions—organizational identity, organizational memory, and values—affecting managerial cognition and facilitated breaking out of their prior strategic frame to enable Nippon Gakki to explore a wide variety of strategic options unfettered by its extant product classes, industry affiliations, and technological competency. These findings invite further studies of the effects of political ideology on managerial cognition, their organizational mechanisms, and the managerial use of nationalistic ideologies."
2020,"Follow Him or Her? CEO Gender and Inter-organizational Imitation of Strategic Investments -- Research suggests that organizations within an industry tend to imitate each other’s actions to alleviate uncertainty around strategic investments, and, in this process, focal firms are likelier to imitate some referent firms rather than others based on the social structural attributes of the referent firm. We extend this prior research to argue that the imitability of referent firms’ strategic actions will also be determined by the gender of the CEOs leading those firms. Based on significant domains in gender research, we formulate competing predictions about the role of CEO gender in driving inter-organizational imitation: gender serves as either a discounting or distinctiveness-based cue. We further posit focal CEO’s political ideology – on the conservatism-liberalism continuum – as the reconciliatory boundary condition for resolving these two competing predictions. We test these ideas using a large, longitudinal sample of S&P 1500 firms during 1994-2017. Our findings provide generalized support for the discounting-based mechanism in focal firms’ imitation of referent firms’ advertising and R&D investments, suggesting that, all else equal, male CEOs’ actions are imitated at higher rates, but also indicate that liberal-leaning focal CEOs may tend toward distinctiveness-cue, imitating female CEO-led firms at higher rates than their conservative-leaning counterparts."
2020,"Founder Cognitions and New Venture Outcomes -- How do entrepreneurs’ cognitions shape their ventures? While research has established that founders’ backgrounds and prior experiences shape their firms and firm outcomes with long-lasting consequences, these studies have largely taken for granted the underlying founder cognitions that transfer individual-level variation to the firm level. Little is known about how entrepreneurs think, and how their cognitions affect firm-level outcomes such as revenue. To uncover entrepreneurial cognition, this study uses a mixed methods approach. Using applications submitted online by entrepreneurs seeking funding from a large, nonprofit foundation, an inductive grounded theory analysis reveals two diverging cognitions – an “exchange construal” and an “organization construal” – that reflect differences in how entrepreneurs think about themselves and their ventures. These findings are then scaled across 139,806 applications, using a supervised machine learning method, to test whether and how these construals influence firm-level outcomes. The results indicate that entrepreneurs’ construals are significantly associated with differences in firm revenue. These findings suggest that entrepreneurial cognition is imprinted into the firm and impacts firm outcomes, illuminating a contributing factor to heterogeneity in new venture outcomes."
2020,"Identity Consistency as a Signal of Resource Autonomy in Acquisitions -- Drawing on market signaling theory, this paper examines whether the market positively reacts to acquisitions when firms express a consistent organizational identity. We theorize that identity consistency signals a firm’s autonomy in utilizing resources to pursue economic profits. Such a market signal reduces investor perceived uncertainty in management activities and boosts market confidence in the capitalization of acquired resources. The signaling effect is also found to be stronger under a positive earnings surprise and a stable industry environment."
2020,"Tertius Dominans and the Persistence of Structural Holes among K-Pop Songwriters -- This paper explores how inequality between successful artists—who can access to a wealth of opportunities—and unsuccessful artists—who face daunting challenges even to survive in their career—provides unique insight into the persistence of structural holes in collaboration networks. The author proposes that when two unsuccessful artists who never collaborated before share a tertius dominans, that is, a common collaborator who is more successful, the unsuccessful artists are less likely to initiate a new collaboration that excludes the tertius dominans. This allows structural holes of the successful artists to persist. Studying the careers and collaboration network of K-Pop (Korean popular music) songwriters, the author argues that daunting career challenges make unsuccessful artists yield brokerage opportunities to their successful collaborator who can bring them better career prospects. Using several empirical designs, including case-control design, songwriter fixed effects, and difference-in-differences, the author estimates the hazard of exclusive closure, where the disconnected collaborators initiate a new collaboration without the broker, and finds supporting evidence. Implications to studies on the instability of structural holes, inequality and networks, and the careers of cultural production are discussed."
2020,"Breaking Out Without Selling Out -- Based on a theoretical framework that addresses the “motive inference problem,” I identify when and why expansion may be interpreted as betrayal by original customers and when original customers may accept and even welcome expansion. In particular, insofar as the available market size in the original market segment seems too small for survival and sustaining services valued by original customers, expansion to new segments will appear justified as a way to serve original customers. By contrast, when the available market size in the original market segment seems sufficiently large, expansion will raise suspicion of betrayal. This theory is tested in two studies. Study 1 shows that expansion of a microbrewery beyond its home state is associated with lower online ratings from home-state reviewers when the available market size in the home state is large but the same action is associated with higher ratings when the home state’s available market size is small. Study 2, an online experiment on a simulated consumer goods startup, shows that the key driver of the effect is the consumer’s perception of how expansion undermines or augments a startup’s perceived commitment to its original customers."
2020,"Unpacking Stigmatization: Labeling, Audience Heterogeneity, and Market-Based Sanctioning -- Existing research on organizational stigma has predominantly focused on its origins, as well as for the consequences of stigma for the organizations that are subjected to it. By contrast, the stigmatization process has remained relatively unexplored from an empirical standpoint. In this paper, therefore, we theorize about the stigmatization process and we suggest that its effectiveness in eliciting market-based sanctions will be a function of: 1) the labels used in framing stigmatizing judgments; 2) the audiences using those labels; 3) the “fit” between vilifying labels and the audiences using them. Through an analysis of cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) in the wake of stigmatizing judgments formulated by various audiences and targeting firms active in the defense industry between 1998 and 2016, we find broad support for our arguments."
2020,"Anchored Differentiation: The Role of Temporal Distance in the Comparison and Evaluation of New Pro -- A new design can be compared with its contemporaries or older designs. In this study, we argue that the temporal distance between the new design and its comparison play an important role in understanding how a new design’s similarity with other designs contributes to its market valuation. Construing the value of designs as a combination of their informational value and their expressive value, we propose the anchored differentiation hypothesis. Specifically, we argue that the market audience weighs the expressive value (which enhances with how much the new design appears different from others) more than the informational value (which enhances with how much the new design appears similar to others) when the comparison is made to contemporary designs. However, the market weighs informational value more than expressive value when the comparison is made against designs from the past. From a data set that combines US design patents and stock market reactions in the days subsequent to such a patent being granted, we explore how a new design’s degree of similarity vis-à-vis contemporaries or predecessors affect its market value. We find that the market value for a new design decreases with its similarities to contemporary new designs (contemporary differentiation) but increases with its similarities to prior designs (past anchoring). Furthermore, we find that the value of contemporary differentiation is enhanced with increased product visibility, whereas the value of past anchoring is enhanced with increased product technological lifespan. Hence, we contribute to the growing literature on optimal distinctiveness and design innovation by offering a dynamic perspective that helps resolve the tension between similarities and differences in evaluating new designs."
2020,"Feedback in creative processes: Toward a communicative action perspective -- Research on creativity highlights the role of feedback as a contextual factor that fosters creative performance. However, it advances a rather mechanistic understanding of communication that obscures the specific practices in feedback interactions and their constitutive power in shaping creative performance. In this paper, we develop a framework that conceptualizes how organizational actors interact in communicative feedback processes on creative ideas. By drawing on the theory of communicative action by Jürgen Habermas and Hans Joas’ theory of creative action, we make the case for a more complex and nuanced understanding of organizational creativity as constituted in communication processes. In doing so, we highlight the important but underresearched role of recipients when confronted with creative ideas by delineating the communicative struggles that these actors face in this process. We extend the literature on creativity by introducing a theory of communicative action as a suitable lens to better understand communication processes through which creativity does or does not come into being."
2020,"Organizational Resilience: A model and Future Research Agenda -- In the face of challenging conditions, resilience capabilities are essential for organizational survival and sustainability. Despite significant academic interest and practical utility of this construct, a lack of theoretical foundation, definitional inconsistencies, and an apparent operational muddle predominates. Extant reviews of this topic comprise an amalgam of frameworks, conceptualizations, and empirical findings from disparate perspectives such as supply chain, strategic, and operational management. Frames of reference from an organizational level are rare. We extend past reviews by deconstructing management-related definitions and measures of organizational resilience through a series of in-depth and broad-based text mining exercises using Leximancer. We found five distinctive research streams, suggesting that organizational resilience is comprised of cognitive, behavioral, and micro-foundational components. We conclude with a unifying definition that can bring coherence and clarity for future research. The central role of contextual contingencies such as the environmental conditions, time, and timing is highlighted."
2020,"Broadening Vision Around Values: An Integrative Two-Factor Theory of Workplace Value Congruence -- Value congruence is an important determinant of human behavior in organizations. It influences positive states for workers (e.g., a sense of belonging, job satisfaction, and positive affect) and is beneficial for organizational work practices (e.g., commitment, citizenship behaviors, and tenure). Conversely, value incongruence leads to negative states (e.g., out-groups, organizational exit, and depressive symptoms). To date, values have been conceptualized context-free (e.g., human or personal values) or disaggregatedly in the work environment (e.g., work values, political values, leadership values, and cultural values) and value congruence has been viewed almost exclusively as a positive construct. Based on the underlying theories of variation theory, salient value similarity hypothesis, self-categorization theory, and signaling theory, and adopting the ‘similarity leads to attraction’ and ‘dissimilarity leads to repulsion’ hypotheses, we develop an integrative two-factor theory of value congruence. This model integrates work, political, cultural, and leadership values, and conceptualizes the impact of congruency and incongruency as two separate psychological processes. We conclude with a discussion of directions for future research."
2020,"Exploring Routine Interdependence: Fluid Boundaries and Adaptive Patterning -- This paper advances theorizing on routine interdependencies and related methodological challenges. We aim to challenge the implicit assumption within cluster or ecology-based conceptualizations of routine interdependence that routines are clearly distinguishable pro-cesses interrelated via interfaces and/or people. Building on an ethnographic longitudinal case study of routine change within a manufacturing firm, we develop a framework that explains routine interdependence beyond clusters or ecologies. Thereby we contribute to routine inter-dependence research in three ways: First, routine boundaries are blurry and dynamically shift-ing rendering it difficult to identify them ex-ante and ex-post. Second, as a result the coordination of routine interdependence occurs between dynamically, reciprocally interrelated action steps rather than at the interface between routines. Third, these insights raise important methodological questions of granularity, which have significant implications for our interpretation and study of routine stability and/or change. Stability and/or change thus become a matter of different levels of analysis which need to be taken into account when comparing routine inter-relations as either clusters or ecologies."
2020,"Granularity Matters! Towards a Methodological Framework for Routine Studies -- This paper introduces the concept of granularity into routine dynamics studies. To establish levels of granularity we develop a phenomenological perspective on action, the central category of routine dynamics studies. By conducting an extensive literature review we show that routine dynamics scholars have at least unconsciously applied diverging levels of granularity in their empirical studies. We argue that side-stepping questions of explicitly addressing granularity significantly impedes the comparability of studies since different levels of granularity bring different aspects of performing and patterning processes into focus. Following this, we develop a methodological framework that allows scholars to establish and report on the level of granularity in their study. Finally, we sketch out some implications of taking granularity seriously for writing up research on routine dynamics."
2020,"Managerial Interpretations of Performance Feedback -- Organizational performance feedback theory, derived from the Behavioral Theory of the Firm, is one of the most utilized theories to explain strategic behavior of organizations. This theory argues that when performance relative to aspiration levels decreases, problemistic search increases. However, empirical evidence is not as unequivocal. We propose that one way to resolve the contradicting empirical evidence is to identify and study in-depth factors that explain the coalescence between the process of performance-aspiration comparison and managers’ interpretations of performance feedback. In this conceptual paper, we extend the performance assessment component of performance feedback theory. We do so by arguing for a more refined and elaborated behavioral model of responses to performance feedback, based not only on whether performance surpasses the aspiration level or not, but also accounting for managers’ assessment of reliability and for their level of satisfaction. To facilitate future research on responsiveness to performance feedback we provide testable propositions."
2020,"Cross-pollinating in the beehive: embracing hybridity at a social entrepreneurship coworking space -- How does participating in a coworking space enable entrepreneurs to embrace plural institutional logics and engage in “hybrid venturing”? To explore this question, our research draws on a longitudinal study of a French coworking space gathering entrepreneurs who seek to reconcile social and commercial logics in the context of a socially entrepreneurial project. As social entrepreneurs generally lack pre-established patterns specific to this “hybrid” venturing mode, we show that the interactions at the coworking space help them embrace hybridity through (1) identifying with a community of peer, like-minded entrepreneurs; (2) collectively learning about and experimenting with this venturing mode, through their own projects but also through the coworking space as a hybrid venture in itself; and (3) connecting with and contributing to building the emerging ecosystem around hybrid venturing. The perception of the coworking experience, however, varies depending on the previous background of the entrepreneurs and in particular their familiarity with each of the logics at play. These findings contribute to the literatures on hybrid venturing and organizing, coworking spaces, and social entrepreneurship."
2020,"Reframing Sequences And Revising Spaces -- We study how corporate innovators develop their frames over time to legitimize their innovations for internal and external audiences. Existing literature has focused on either internally or externally legitimizing innovations but not on how these processes interact. This interaction is important, however, as innovators often depend on diverse audiences simultaneously. By following four corporate ventures at a healthcare incumbent firm, we find that the initial frame and the sequence of frames determine whether internal and external legitimacy is gained and maintained over time. We found that it was particularly effective to initially emphasize novelty by framing an innovation as distinctive, because that created the most space for revising frames in the future. Familiarity frames, instead, constrained innovators because they inhibited innovators’ space to reframe their innovations and address emerging legitimacy threats. This illuminates that framing to gain and maintain internal and external legitimacy depended not only on innovators’ initial frames but also on the subsequent sequence of frames over time. For corporate innovators this indicates that they mostly benefit from emphasizing the novelty of their innovations as this enables them to address emerging legitimacy crises over time and maintain the legitimacy they previously acquired. We discuss implications for literature on framing and legitimacy."
2020,"Making the Impossible Possible: Paradoxical Processes of Reconstructing a Grand Challenge -- Advancing the promise of paradox theory to address large-scale complex social problems, or grand challenges, necessitates focus on paradox at the interorganizational level. We contribute to this by developing an empirically-grounded framework explaining how distributed organizational actors work through multiple paradoxes to address a grand challenge. We draw on a global qualitative study of a grand challenge: how to improve the speed of low and middle-income countries’ financial response in the immediate aftermath of natural disasters. We focus specifically on initiatives that bring together government, market and development actors to ensure rapid capital flows for immediate disaster response. Three paradoxes permeate our grand challenge: whole-part; long-short; and developmental-financial. By focusing on critical incidents, we show how: (a) distributed actors work through paradoxes by situated focusing: foregrounding one pole in order to achieve the other; (b) paradoxical poles are entangled in a process of situated knotting; (c) localized actions arising from situated focusing and situated knotting contribute to an expanding repertoire of possible actions for addressing the grand challenge globally. We advance paradox theorizing on paradox salience, multiplicity, and the dynamics of shaping paradox equilibrium. We also further understanding of how grand challenges evolve within the fragmented interests of distributed actors."
2020,"The role of translation in the formation of a field: the case of a startup ecosystem -- How does the process of translation shape the formation of a field? While previous studies focused on the influence of top-down forces shaping the process of translation, few studies highlighted how translation processes shape the formation of institutions. By studying the emergence of a startup ecosystem, a manifestation of an institutional field; this paper theorizes the micro-processes and dynamics of field formation. We pay particular heed to, and advance the process of translation as the formation of a field is marked by a lack of stability, clearly defined roles and rules. This paper extends the translation literature, by elaborating on different types of ‘translation work’ and how these shift as the field forms and develops. Lastly, this paper contributes a better understanding of the roles of carriers in the translation processes, an area that is understudied to date."
2020,"Orchestrating for Performative Resource and Capability Configurations -- Value-adding orchestrations of resources and capabilities are at the heart of Penrose’s resource-base-view (RBV). However, while the management literature unanimously agrees on the importance of such resources and capabilities orchestrations for performance at the level of the firm, little research has investigated how performative firms, those firms leading their respective industries, orchestrate their resources and capabilities. This paper has two significant contributions: Theoretically, it takes a performative lens to the RBV and thereby focuses on specifically on the resource-capability orchestrations of firms with performative outputs. Empirically, the paper is one of the first to apply a configurational methodology to identify these performative resource-capability orchestrations by investigating 124 performative Danish manufacturing firms and their investments and deployments of innovative technology resources and human-centred capabilities. The paper finds that there are differences in the orchestration of resources and capabilities based on the innovativeness of the firm’s outputs. Performative firms make heavy investments into and deployment of technologies, but only the configurations of the most performative firms additionally include investments into and deployments of specific human-centred capabilities. Important implications emerge in relation to what performativity theory can add to the original RBV and how a configurational methodology can operationalize this theory."
2020,"The Interplay between Institutional and Individual Determinants of Organizational Transparency -- This paper develops organizational transparency theory by exploring the determinants of transparency. A typology-based model explores the interplay between the institutional and the individual determinants of organizational transparency. The typology explains the mechanisms and outcomes of different combinations of the determinants of transparency, which lead to four archetypes of transparency: Complete transparency, Symbolic transparency, Illusionary transparency, and Residual transparency. This multilevel approach provides a new perspective, which helps to interpret the conflicting results of past studies of the determinants of transparency. It reveals the conditions under which the unintended consequences of transparency initiatives—such as information decoupling or the transparency paradox—may occur. The practical implications of ways of making organizations more transparent are considered with a view to avoiding the negative consequences of transparency initiatives."
2020,"The (relative) effects of typicality on volatility: A study using word embeddings -- Studies on typical firms – firms which are aligned with the prototype of their industry – have focused on whether typicality leads to superior or inferior valuations by audiences. They largely ignore the impact that typicality may have on the stability of audiences’ valuations over time. This paper proposes that typical firms experience lower volatility in stock prices as investors can make meaningful inferences based on the information encoded in industry prototypes to value them. This effect is weaker in ambiguous industry categories, as the information encoded in prototypes is of lower quality. I test these hypotheses in the setting of publicly listed firms in the U.S. I measure typicality using a new method that relies on word embeddings and a corpus of over 80,000 annual reports to represent firms in a shared semantic space. Results largely support the proposed hypotheses. This has implications for the literature on market categories, for the literature on organizational approaches to financial markets, and for computational approaches to organizational phenomena."
2020,"Broadening our Sight of Leadership Relationships. Moving from Dyads to Triads. -- In studying social relations, going from dyads to triads has the greatest impact on relational dynamics than any other change in group size. Yet triads are an underutilized unit of analysis in the appraisal of leadership relationships. This paper proposes that triads are a leadership configuration on their own right, which magnifies three leadership relational dynamics otherwise under-emphasized in dyads, groups or networks. These triadic leadership phenomena are: the role co-enactment (where the same person is concurrently a leader and a follower); the mediation of leadership (where one individual brokers leadership across triad constituents); and the skip-level relationships (where two constituents can form coalitions cutting through reporting lines). By utilizing main triadic theories and research this paper analyses these phenomena and their relevance for organizations, proposing four theoretical types of triads, along the assumptions of formality (vertical vs horizontal), and symmetry of relationships (between leader and follower). The contribution to leadership theory is multiple because the triadic phenomena and the triads typology broaden our understanding of leadership away from heroic views onto more pragmatic and context-dependent ones. This paper offers practical insights of leadership as an adaptive activity, where the roles of leader and follower are interconnected, and effectiveness is centered on the capacity to shift roles according to the flow of influence."
2020,"Business models as artefacts driving temporal segmentation and logic consolidation -- We investigated coexistence of alternative business logics by studying business model differences as manifestations of the underlying logic. We build on institutional complexity by studying the ways in which existing and entering actors rationalize the external and internal drivers of change and turn these into business models. Our results show the close connection between business model and the underlying logic that confines the available business model options for institutionalized actors. The study contributes to the institutional logic theory by illustrating the institutional foundation of a business model, identifying key characteristics of competing business logics, and suggests novel mechanisms of temporal segmentation and logic consolidation for managing the co-existence of the alternative logics."
2020,"Lone Geniuses Or Collaborative Pairs? Formal Role Separation to Enhance Organizational Creativity -- Drawing from the literature on formal roles and organizational creativity, we tested whether formal role separation between creative and business functions at the top of organizations enhances their creativity and under which conditions such separation has a significant impact. While the “role as resource” approach sees in functional separation a way to combine diverse claims and access various forms of capital, we investigate its link with the generation of novel and useful outcomes. In the setting of high-end fashion houses, we found that when two distinct individuals filled the formal roles of creative director and CEO, organizational creativity was significantly higher. Organizational creativity is especially enhanced in cases of formal role separation when the creative director works on multiple projects because this improves specialization and gives more freedom to creative directors to experiment with novelty. Besides, companies, whose creative director and CEO started working for them at the same time, show superior creativity results. We found no evidence that formal role separation is beneficial for the focal firm’s creativity when its creative director works for multiple companies. Our findings suggest that when companies face multiple goals, like creative organizations, having a clear formal role configuration is beneficial to organizational creativity."
2020,"Saying hello and waving goodbye: intra-organizational tie formation when brokers leave -- Brokers, who serve as indirect ties between others, can play an important role in the formation of new collaborative relationships. Yet we know little about how the mobility of such individuals changes the role that they play. In this paper, I explore the how the organizational exit of individuals in brokerage positions influences tie formation between previously unconnected workers. Whereas these exiting individuals may be expected to play a lesser role in the formation of new collaborative relationships, I argue that they may in fact play a greater role as their exit will both stimulate demand for such helpful brokering among the workers they will leave behind and alter the costs of this type of brokering. I explore the impact of brokers on tie formation using data on employees engaged in scientific research within a single organization. Using journal article co-authorship to identify collaborative ties, I find support for my argument. Furthermore, I show how the role of exiting brokers varies depending upon the nature of their exit, tie strength, and the relative status of the brokers. In so doing, this paper illuminates how new tie formation is shaped by the mobility of brokers, extending our understanding of the dynamics of collaborative networks within organizational settings, brokerage, and the effects of employee mobility."
2020,"Ecological perspective on organizational resilience: Ethnography of Korean Buddhist temple -- Organization scholars tend to conceptualize the notion of resilience as recovery capacity. The concept is often operationalized by return time, i.e., a measure of how quickly an organization bounces back to an initial state from an external shock. Such conceptualization and operationalization reflect an engineering perspective on resilience. This tendency, however, omits a much richer framework for understanding resilience—an ecological perspective that focuses more on adaptive capacity of organizational system. Drawing upon ecological perspective, we aim to unpack internal mechanisms that shed more light on the adaptive aspects of resilience. We conducted three-month ethnography in one of the most revered Buddhist temples in Korea. Korean Buddhist temples are situated to adapt to rapidly changing socio-economic environment in Korea over the last decades, yet they also hope to protect historical tradition against change. Our real-time participant observation and inductive analysis show how a Korean Buddhist temple has maintained its core historical identity while adapting to changing environment. We theorize two contradicting elements of the mechanism ‘pushing’ and ‘pulling’ that enable an organization to simultaneously balance change and tradition in the midst of environmental change."
2020,"The Effect of Sustainability Manager’s Field Engagement on Organizational Adoption of Sustainability -- Social activists are often successful in their disputes with target organizations, as is evident from the concessions targeted organizations often make. However, concessions do not necessarily result in substantive changes. This is because over a longer period of time, activists are not fully capable of monitoring and maintaining direct pressure on targets or continuing to generate negative publicity. This paper contributes to research at the intersection of movements and organizations by investigating if, and if so, how individuals that are formally tasked with instituting movement-aligned changes, termed “insider allies,” achieve subsequent and substantive changes in their organization. Using data on U.S. higher education organizations, we examine the effect of field-level engagement from sustainability managers—the insider allies, in our case—on adopting a voluntary sustainability reporting tool which is an indicator of change beyond initial commitments. The results of a longitudinal quantitative analysis of 622 schools demonstrate that the more sustainability managers have participated in field interactions, the greater the likelihood that their school adopts the voluntary reporting tool. Our findings indicate that engagement in field-level interactions with a range of actors around central issues that are pertinent to the movement enables insider allies to mobilize resources and craft identities as change agents that enable them to drive substantive change within their organizations."
2020,"Queens of Drag: A Multidimensional Perspective on Core Stigma -- This paper critically assesses RuPaul’s Drag Race as a stigmatized organization which has built its success on the active spectacularization of its core stigma, through the showcasing of specific organizational discourses and transgressions. Drag Race is an interesting case as the organization does not conceal stigma; on the contrary, it leverages the transgressions associated with the social deviance of drag queens, enhancing success and acceptance with wider audiences over time. We focus on how audiences generate discourses that trigger this acceptance and how the organization fuels these discourses, using them as strategic resources for organizational performance. We adopt a performativity perspective to analyze discourses generated by the audiences and by the organization itself, primarily focusing on online discourses. We contribute to a better understanding of how organizations can leverage the factors that lead to their stigmatization and make them acceptable for different audiences."
2020,"Identity work orientation: unpacking divergent identity construction processes of police newcomers -- Through a longitudinal ethnographic study of new recruits into an English police service we explain how different ‘identity work orientations’ (i.e. legitimacy, authenticity and competence seeking) direct different patterns of identity work and produce different work identities within the same socialization processes. In so doing, we make a three-fold contribution. First, departing from mainstream research of newcomers’ identity construction, our study highlights the fragmentation and diversity of externally provided work identities and the important influences of newcomers’ own orientations in their identity formation. Second, by illustrating three distinct identity work processes, we challenge the monolithic portrait of identity work and theoretical disconnection in the identity work literature. Third, we offer identity work orientation as an analytical lens that transcends theoretical boundaries and sensitizes researchers to diverse identity work. Key words: Identity construction, identity work, newcomer socialization, police."
2020,"Risky Business: Status and Costs in the Market for Audit Services -- A large body of research in sociology and management presumes that lower costs are one of the most significant advantages that high-status firms enjoy. Although prior research provides some support for this argument, the evidence is limited and largely indirect. In order to better understand the relationship between a firm’s status and the costs it incurs, we analyze fees paid by clients in the $60 billion U.S. market for audit services. Contrary to the predictions of existing theory, we find that high-status firms tend to pay more than their peers, even after controlling for the complexity and riskiness of the audit. Our analyses suggest that the most likely explanation centers around the role of status in attracting disproportionate attention; auditors seem to charge their high-status firms more in anticipation of the increased attention that they suspect such firms will garner in cases of misconduct."
2020,"Converging Tides Lift All Boats -- This paper investigates the consequences of an understudied yet prevalent phenomenon in emerging technology fields: consensus/disagreement among experts on the proper criteria to use in evaluating firms’ technologies. While previous studies show that the emergence of evaluation criteria for a technology improves the life chances of well-performing firms in the new sector, we theorize that consensus in evaluation criteria increases investments to all firms and found supportive evidence from an experiment with 80 Chinese investors (Study 1). We further argue and found, in a second experiment with 412 U.S. participants (Study 2), that evaluation criteria consensus increases investments because it induces investors to view all firms in the new sector as technologically competent and to predict positive evaluations from others. Analyses of archival data on investment in U.S. (Study 3a) and Chinese firms (Study 3b) in artificial intelligence technology fields also lend support to our arguments. By exploring the social-cognitive processes that link technology evaluation criteria consensus to investments in emerging technology fields, this paper advances scholarly understanding of the micro-foundations of the institutionalization processes in new market sectors."
2020,"Enhancing Linguistic Inclusiveness in Organizations: A Russophone Bank in Post-Soviet Kazakhstan -- With the growing demand for linguistic inclusiveness in society – a condition where different languages are respected – organizations often face pressure from stakeholders (e.g., governments, customers) to incorporate multiple languages into their operations. Nevertheless, organizations often pursue linguistic homogenization (e.g., using a single dominant language) to achieve greater efficiency or to enter the global market, excluding other languages from their core activities. Reflecting this phenomenon, organizational scholars largely focus on the selective use of languages and its exclusionary effects on intra-organizational dynamics. As a result, little is known on how organizations can embrace low-status languages and enhance linguistic inclusiveness over time. Our qualitative study of a Russophone bank in Kazakhstan shows how monolingual employees gradually changed their linguistic practices in a context where incorporating a low-status language (Kazakh) into business operations was a very low priority for the organization. We found that a small group of language workers, initially hired to help the organization maintain monolingual practices, could behave outside the boundaries of what they are originally hired to do, and sparked changes in the organization’s linguistic dynamics. Our analysis shows the ways in which language workers demanded respect and contributed to the creation of a linguistically more inclusive environment. By theorizing a process through which previously marginalized languages can gain recognition and become part of everyday organizational practices, we provide important insights on multilingualism and linguistic inclusiveness in organizations."
2020,"The evolutionary paths of competence and integrity trust violation processes -- We explore trust violation as a diagnostic process. Based on the in-depth analysis of four cases, we present trust violation diagnosis as a path-dependent process in which the initial labeling of a transgression (competence-based or integrity-based) has an important bearing on the process. Understanding this process forms the basis for suggestions of how early interventions could prevent the breakdown of trust."
2020,"Direct versus Indirect Vendor Channels and the Scaling of Worker Voice Around Digital Technologies -- In this longitudinal, qualitative study, I follow the use of a digital production monitoring system in a manufacturing firm to study mechanisms for worker voice in the context of digital, networked technologies. As a complement to studies that situate mechanisms for worker voice in the relationship between workers and employers, I draw four conclusions regarding worker voice around these new technologies sometimes referred to as “Industry 4.0.” First, worker voice can meaningfully occur long after the initial design and deployment phases of new technologies. Second, the effectiveness of worker voice may depend on the type of channel that exists between workers and third-party vendors. In particular, direct versus indirect vendor channels for worker voice can shape the practices by which workers draw attention to problems between the technology and the workflow, speak for the benefit of a key user, and pose technology solutions. Third, when workers have direct vendor channels, they can more effectively use voice practices to achieve worker-centric technological capabilities—improvements that expand the control of workers, including reducing surveillance and increasing worker access to data. Finally, new worker-centric technological capabilities can be quickly and broadly distributed by the vendor across the field of firms using the technology."
2020,"Work-Life Postures for Organizations: Organizational Structural and Cultural Responses to Employees -- We propose an organizational perspective for work-life balance (WLB) policies and work-personal conflict (WPC) accommodations derived from the macro, organizational and job environments. To explain our theoretical model, we draw from institutional theory (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983) and signaling theory (Spence, 1974; Spence, 1973) and recognize job demands to explicate drivers for the implementation of WLB polices and WPC accommodations. Conceptually we differentiate between work-life balance and work-personal conflict and clarify the meaning of these constructs using a structural and cultural framework for WLB policies and WPC accommodations. Further, we discuss levels of deployment in WLB policies and WPC accommodations and how such levels can have differential implications for organizations and its employees. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed."
2020,"Tweet Storms as Social Movements? Managing Stakeholders in the Social Media Era -- The manner in which social movements influence firms has garnered significant research among organizational scholars. This research has suggested that secondary stakeholders, lacking direct access or power, influence firms through enlisting the support of elites such as the media to increase the salience and urgency of collective actions. However, social media provide secondary stakeholders additional tools to bypass traditional media elites in pressing their agenda. We first develop new theory to describe how collective actions organized using social media influence firms through multiple paths. Specifically, collective actions (e.g., email campaigns, petitions, threats of boycotts) can influence managers directly through reputation threats on social media and indirectly through primary stakeholders who can pressure managers to address the social media propagated issues. We then introduce a new model for firms to manage social movements emanating from social media. The theoretical and practical implications of our model are also discussed."
2020,"Bottled up or Poured out: How Product Name Emotions Affect Appeal and Authenticity -- Although we know that product names influence audience evaluations of producers and their offerings, mechanisms behind the effect remain undertheorized. We propose that a classic psychological stimulus-and-response process is at play. Emotional contagion – ego’s propensity to experience emotions triggered by contact with alters or objects – suggests that product names that convey certain emotions to the consumers of these products will influence their evaluations. While the process is psychological, social context shapes the strength and valence in the stimulus-and-response relationship. We predict that the anti-mass production ideology and oppositional identity of contemporary craft markets (rooted in avid rejection of pecuniary motivation, template marketing, serial production and the like) produce reverse emotional contagion: Positively charged product names lead to negative evaluations of products and negatively charged ones lead to positive evaluations. We also predict a second-order effect of product name emotionality on appeal by way of perceived product authenticity which itself drives appeal in craft markets: Positive emotionality decreases authenticity perceptions and negative emotionality elevates them. We find empirical support for our conjectures in analyses of the U.S. craft beer industry between 1996 and 2012."
2020,"Knowledge Leakage and Institutional Legitimacy in Competitive Dynamics -- Interorganizational ties are ubiquitous and connect businesses to other organizations within their field as well as up- or downstream organizations such as patent prosecutors. In interacting with such parties, companies often must provide knowledge that lies at the core of their competitive advantage to receive the best service possible. Organizations might, thus, be inclined to avoid working with service providers via which indirect links to competitors are created, out of fear of knowledge leakage. However, we argue that forces of legitimation by association with reputable service providers, or even competitors, can counteract fear of knowledge leakage. At higher levels of connectedness to competitors, the selecting organization's fear of knowledge leakage starts taking over and attenuates the probability of choice again. We test our theory studying patent prosecution in the field of computer technologies and find initial support for our proposition"
2020,"The Role of Confucian Moral Virtues in Transforming the Stigma-inducing Moral System -- This study builds theory on the role of traditional moral virtues in enabling actors to transform the stigma-inducing dominant moral system. Drawing on a longitudinal, qualitative study of early private entrepreneurship in China, the findings suggest that stigmatized actors’ continuous moral work involving both rhetoric and enactment of moral virtues can be effective in influencing the dominant moral system, which has been utilized to stigmatize them. Further, the moral work generates feeling of solidarity amongst stigmatized and elicits positive sentiments from the stigmatizers, deepening existing knowledge of audience dynamics in the stigma literature. We discuss the implication of connecting morality with stigma for the study of stigma and social progress. Key words: stigma, morality, moral virtues, qualitative research"
2020,"Agency in network signaling: When do biotech firms signal their alliance formation in press releases -- Social network research suggests that actors are strategic in forming and activating social structures. Actors strategically manage their networks in order to reap the direct benefits of networks such as access to information or resource. Yet, network research has not fully investigated the extent to which agency exists in reaping the indirect benefits of networks. I examine whether agency extends beyond formation and activation to also apply to the signals organizations send to audiences about the status of the partners with which they affiliate. I address the following research question: to what extent does partner’s relative status influence the organization’s choices of sending signals about their networks? In an analysis of press releases about strategic alliance formation by biotechnology firms, I find support for the claim that firms are strategic in sending signals to audiences about their alliance partner. This paper contributes to social network research by connecting research on agency in networks and signaling benefits of networks. The key implication advanced by the paper is that signals about partners constitute another source of network benefit, in addition to the direct materials resources derived from actors’ relations and positions within a social structure."
2020,"Integrating Multiple Sustainability Objectives through Deliberation: The Case of Degrowth Businesses -- In times of pressing global sustainability challenges, companies need to find ways to integrate economic, environmental and social aspects into all their business activities in order to address all sustainability dimensions simultaneously without emphasizing one dimension over another. Degrowth businesses are considered to combine multiple sustainability objectives to an intense degree, while implementing elements of deliberative democracy by enabling and empowering affected people to participate in and actively shape the value creation process. Although recent hybrid organizing research points to the potential of deliberative democracy to support the integration of multiple (contradicting) objectives in organizational contexts, we lack research into the underlying processes and mechanisms. This paper addresses this research gap by investigating how degrowth businesses manage the integration of multiple sustainability objectives. Based on a qualitative-inductive analysis of in-depth interview data, a dynamic model of deliberative objective integration is developed elucidating the dynamic and iterative process of objective integration as a process of steady readjustment in order to achieve stability in the sense that all objectives are achieved simultaneously over time. This model shows that deliberation in organizational contexts represents an effective mechanism that fosters a high degree of objective integration and hence ensures the successful simultaneous pursuit of multiple sustainability objectives over time."
2020,"Organizational Routines and Adaptability: The Effects of Routines in Building TMS -- Organizational routines are ubiquitous stores of knowledge in organizations. Although routines enable consistent performance on tasks over time, routines might hinder adaptability by promoting inertia and rigidity. In this dissertation, I develop how routines could facilitate adaptation in organizations and foster successful performance on novel tasks. I argue that teams are changed in the process of using routines. I develop and test theory arguing that routines can facilitate the development of transactive memory systems (TMS), collective systems for encoding, storing, and sharing knowledge. I propose that routines provide a structure within which team members can learn about one another’s skills. Thus, routines can build a team’s TMS, which can improve performance on novel tasks. I use a mixed-methods design to both develop and to test theory. In Study 1, I performed 30 semi-structured interviews with United States Marine Corps officers. Based on interview findings, I hypothesize that teams that use routines will develop stronger transactive memory systems than teams that do not. Consequently, I hypothesize that teams that use routines will perform better on novel tasks due to the TMS they have developed. In Study 2, I developed a laboratory study in the cybersecurity context to test the hypotheses. Two hundred and thirteen participants in 71 teams were randomly assigned to perform a task with a routine or without a routine, and then perform a novel task. Results provide evidence to support the hypotheses."
2020,"DYNAMIC INERTIA: How organizations avoid adapting to changes in the environment -- What prevents organizations from adapting to substantial environmental changes? Research from a performative perspective has challenged traditional accounts of cognitive and structural inertia by highlighting how organizational actors dynamically enact routines in a manner that engenders change or stability. However, a puzzle remains: When responding to substantial changes in the environment, how do organizational actors generate inertia? We investigate this question by conducting an inductive, historical study of the credit rating routine of Moody’s, an organization that failed to adapt to substantial changes in its environment in the run up to the financial crisis of 2008. Our analysis of the actions associated with the re-designing of central artifacts and the enactment of the routine reveals six mechanisms by which organizational actors generate inertia. First, when re-designing artifacts, actors generate inertia through bounded retheorizing of the model, the sedimentation of assumptions, and mythical modeling of the unknown. Second, when enacting routines, organizational actors generate inertia by justifying their response to environmental changes through maintaining comprehensibility, appeasing prevailing stakeholders, and exercising professional discretion. Our historical case study contributes to our understanding of organizational inertia, routine dynamics, and the financial crisis of 2008."
2020,"Maintaining a Mandate of Meaningfulness: The Occupation of Career Advisers in Business Schools -- Every occupation requires an occupational mandate to uphold its legitimacy. The mandates literature focuses on nascent occupations constructing mandates through the enactment of occupational values. However, even for mature occupations, mandates require maintenance, and this maintenance might be challenged when the occupation exists in an organization whose values misalign with occupational values. We examine career advisers in undergraduate business schools, a mature occupation whose values around helping students achieve purpose and fit in careers misalign with organizational values held among business school students around wealth or prestige and conformity. We conduct an ethnography of career advisers at an undergraduate business school, combined with an interview study of such advisers throughout the U.S. We find that advisers maintain their mandate through several practices, differentiated by interactional setting and audience. In one-on-one advising sessions, career advisers discerned the alignment between the student’s ambitions and advisers’ values. Advisers enacted value-moderating practices when they perceived student misalignment with advisers’ values, and they engaged in value-magnifying practices when they perceived alignment or openness. In group settings where assessing value congruence was infeasible, advisers engaged in value-masking practices, where they obfuscated values that could conflict with values of students, students’ parents, or business school administrators. Overall, this study shows how members of a mature occupation—whose values misalign with organizational values—actively maintain their mandate by discerning between audiences and occasionally concealing rather than revealing their values."
2020,"Wage Stagnation and the Rise of Merit Pay, 1974-1991 -- In the 1970s, US workers' wages stopped growing and steadily declined through the mid-1990s. During this time, employers experimented with employment practices, like merit pay, that seemed likely to raise pay and productivity. We argue on the contrary that the introduction of merit pay actually weakened organizational constraints that previously boosted pay. First, merit pay practices loosen pay fairness constraints justifying pay gaps on the basis of performance differences. Second, merit pay substitutes for efficiency wages, by providing an alternative mechanism through which employers can elicit worker effort. To test these ideas, we introduce new establishment-by-occupation microdata covering the critical early period of wage stagnation. We show that when establishments adopt merit pay, wages decline. These effects are concentrated on the lowest-paid workers within a job; the lower paid jobs within a workplace; and in the highest-paying blue collar workplaces. The spread of merit-based pay explains one sixth to one third of wage stagnation for low-skilled workers during this period. Organizational practices aggregate up to affect societal trends in inequality and wage growth."
2020,"Soft power strategies: the non-market interactions of corporations and governments -- Resource dependence theory and the field of strategy have drawn attention to corporations use of political action—attempts to shape government decision making in ways favorable to the firm. Yet scant attention has been paid to political action as a process, through which both corporations and governments participate and interact. Utilising recently declassified archival files, we develop an historical case study of how the U.K. government interacted with Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s to secure the highest possible credit rating in 1978, despite receiving an International Monetary Fund bailout two years earlier. Drawing on this case, we develop a process model to offer the first explanation of why and how governments pursue political action to influence corporations. By attending to how corporations and governments interact, we elaborate the unobtrusive function of soft power that has received limited attention in resource dependence theory and been overlooked in corporate political action."
2020,"Two Popes: Religion and Conflicting Institutional Logics Influence on Social Movement Outcomes -- In this paper we aim to understand the relationship between religion, institutional logics, and social movements outcomes. Empirically, we look at the Solidarity Economy Movement (SEM) in Brazil where the Catholic Church had a prominent role in disseminating solidarity economy enterprises. Using a mixed-method approach, we analyze and test how conflicting logics of the Catholic Church influence the work of Caritas (a social movement organization). Our results contribute to the social movement and institutional logics literature."
2020,"Interpersonal, intergroup, and interspecies identity as antecedents of resistance to change -- In light of increasing digitization and the so-called ‘4th industrial revolution’, managers and scholars alike strive to better understand employees’ resistance to organizational change (RTC)—in particular technology-related change—and its antecedents. We explore whether, and if so, how employees’ identities at the interpersonal, intergroup, and interspecies level influence resistance to technology-related organizational change. Based on self-categorization theory, we develop a conceptual framework with an individual’s perception of threat by recent technological advances as mediator. We test our model based on a mixed method design (interviews, pilot survey, field study). Analyses of the main field study show a mediated hampering effect of technological identity (interpersonal level) and a mediated boosting effect of (local) socio-linguistic identity in relation to management (intergroup level), and human identity (interspecies level) on RTC. We derive practical and theoretical implications for research on organizational change, on employee identity, and on change-related communication and foreign language in business."
2020,"Protests As A Double-Edged Sword In Emerging Industries: Evidence From The Commercial Drone Industry -- Although emerging industries are increasingly seen as the outcome of social movement processes, protests have seldom been studied as sources of the liabilities of newness. We find that that anti-technology protests exert two effects: on the one hand, they amplify perceptions of risk about the new technology and impede entrepreneurial entry, but on the other hand, protests create a demand for regulation, and in turn, regulations authorize a new technology and facilitate entrepreneurial entry. Thus, protests are a double-edged sword in emerging industries; they produce liabilities of newness by constructing risk, but attenuate the liabilities of newness due to their effects on regulation. We discuss the implications for social movements, entrepreneurship, and science and technology studies."
2020,"Venturing with Caution: Insights into the Investment Strategy of Venture Capital Firms -- The literature on portfolio diversification in venture capital contrasts industry specialization as a strategy that helps venture capital firms leverage accumulated industry expertise to diversification as strategy that spreads risk and allows venture capital firms to select riskier, higher-ceiling ventures within each industry. These strategies are generally treated as mutually exclusive and focus on firms' internal expertise. We introduce a social perspective to this literature to argue that firms at different positions in the inter-firm status hierarchy have varying strategic incentives for diversifying their portfolios and also to resolve the trade-off between diversification and specialization. For venture capital firms at the bottom of the status hierarchy, diversification provides a means to seek out riskier ventures that offsets accessing relatively worse equity positions within syndicated investments. For firms with moderate status, specialization provides a means to improve confidence in their credibility to manage investments successfully, improving their ability to gain better equity positions. Firms at the top of the status hierarchy leverage their social influence to coordinate closely related external expertise of syndicate co-investors when the diversify and spread their risk across industry categories while still leveraging specialized knowledge to manage ventures successfully. Analysis of investments made by venture capital firms from 1990 to 2018 reveals that firms low and high in the status hierarchy diversify their portfolios more than firms in the middle of the status hierarchy. When firms higher in the status hierarchy diversify their portfolios, their syndicated investments involving other co-investing firms reflect domain expertise more closely related to the venture company's industry category."
2020,"Communicating sense: The role of inference in joint sensemaking in equivocal contexts -- In this paper, we build a conceptual framework that elaborates the communicative mechanisms by which individuals in high reliability organizations (HROs) jointly make sense in order to coordinate in equivocal contexts. We build on past work in cognitive and discursive sensemaking, while also highlighting that past research tends to conflate cognition and discourse by presupposing cognitive effects of discourse. Instead, we submit that sensemaking research would benefit from a focus on how organizational actors make inferences and build shared understanding in context. We provide this analytical focus on inference by borrowing theoretical principles and assumptions from relevance theory, a theory in the neighboring field of pragmatic linguistics, and illustrating these principles with examples from seminal past cases of sensemaking under pressure. Our conceptual framework exposes the communicative processes of ostension and inference by which actors build a mutual cognitive environment. Crucially, our paper underscores the importance of investigating how failed inferences hinder coordinated action. We elaborate the contributions of our conceptual framework to sensemaking research, reexamining the concepts of equivocality, requisite variety, and double interacts from a communication standpoint."
2020,"Entrepreneurship as a Response to Labor Market Discrimination for Formerly Incarcerated People -- This paper examines entrepreneurship as a way to overcome labor market discrimination. Specifically, we examine entrepreneurship as a career choice for formerly incarcerated individuals, a group of individuals who face substantial discrimination in the labor market. Using the United States National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 data, we find that formerly incarcerated people are more likely to become entrepreneurs compared to individuals without a criminal record. We take advantage of an exogenous state and county level policy shock “Ban-the-Box” in the United States to further disentangle the underlying mechanism of how labor market discrimination affects formerly incarcerated individuals in their entrepreneurial choices. The findings suggest that entrepreneurship is a viable alternative career choice for formerly incarcerated people, yielding both higher income and lower recidivism rates. In addition to reporting robustness checks and addressing alternative explanations, we discuss theoretical, empirical, and policy implications."
2020,"Collective rage, power, and institutions: Examining institutional disruption, defense and reaction -- Abstract: In this paper we explore the role of the collective emotion rage in institutional disruption and change. While rage is considered a form of anger, the unique and intense experience of collective rage and potential for disruption deserves focused attention. We argue that rage can be experienced collectively as well as can be collectively suppressed or can be expressed in a number of ways. When such collective rage is expressed, various forms of collective institutional disruption may occur. We also argue that institutional guardians are likely to resist that disruption and engage in defensive and reactionary behaviors to defend existing institutional structures."
2020,"What does it take to engage with paradoxes: the challenge of persistence -- This paper explores how actors engage with persistent paradoxes over time. Drawing on a two-year participant observation of institutional investors involved in developing a framework for ESG investing, we identify four efforts actors engage in: anchoring, experimenting, ordering and creating a safe zone. Actors do not constantly engage in those four efforts but alternate between moments of active engagement and moments of indirect engagement. This alternation enable them to engage with the paradox over a long period of time, by varying the depth of their engagement. Our study concludes that saliency is not a stable and single state but that there are different manifestations of saliency along a spectrum, contributing in making the paradoxes livable and manageable. Difficult emotions and a sense of purpose and urgency trigger oscillations between direct and indirect engagement with paradoxes."
2020,"Start-up Templates and Nascent Entrepreneurship among Women -- In under-developed contexts, women’s choice of engaging in entrepreneurial activity is constrained due to limited access to knowledge about entrepreneurship processes. We find that start-up templates, defined as codified series of prototypical founding tasks, can provide such knowledge and motivate women to initiate pre-entry activities. In a field experiment design in rural India, we randomly selected a sample of unemployed women for exposure to customized start-up templates, and then observed their decision to initiate pre-entry activity through their sign-ups for a paid enterprise training program. We find that 50% more women sign up when they are exposed to start-up templates as compared to the control group. We further investigate whether this effect is influenced by the template’s description of actions and resources for carrying out the founding tasks. We find that the rate of sign-ups is 24% higher when the start-up templates emphasize the use of social connections, as compared to relying on individual selves. This paper provides causal empirical evidence of how templates can provide entrepreneurial knowledge required for reducing uncertainty and increasing the likelihood of entrepreneurship."
2020,"Your Secrets are Safe with Me? Audience Response to the Exit of Partners with Brokerage Advantage -- The choice of a firm’s exchange partner is an important decision that affects the quality of resources a firm gets. These partners generate social capital by acting as conduits of information flow between a firm and the market. The position where these exchange partners are situated within the organizational network enables access to valuable proprietary information about firms. Hence, the exit of such an exchange partner holding information advantage is expected to invoke a response from the market participants. We tested this by exploiting a unique natural experiment in India where the government made it mandatory for firms to change their auditors at least once every 10 years. We observe a positive response when firms lose an exchange partner holding diverse network positions. However, the response to losing the same is negative when firms associated with the partner are tainted with earnings management or corporate illegality. It is observed that the market is keen to let go of exchange partners with an informational advantage. However, if an exchange partner with information advantage is exiting a tainted entity then the market reacts negatively due to possible fear of unearthing potentially harmful information about the firm in future."
2020,"Framing and complexity: Evidence from the Federal Reserve -- This paper investigates the role of cognitive framing in decision makers’ ability to perceive complexity. Qualitatively studying the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy making committee, the FOMC, and conceptualizing its policy as a complex set of separate but interdependent choices, the paper finds that framing both enables committee members to attend complexity and hinders their ability to do so. By focusing a decision maker’s attention on a few features of the environment, a cognitive frame can effectively push her to perceive interdependencies not visible without that focus. However, by screening out many other features of the environment, interdependencies amongst these are ignored. A (single) frame therefore helps one to perceive low-levels of complexity but hinders the attainment of higher-levels of complexity. In highly complex environments, decision makers should thus exhibit frame heterogeneity, allowing them to attend the problem at hand through multiple frames. The paper has practical implications to the design of a broad range of decision making groups: it is argued that if the group is confronted with complex problems, individual members ought to exhibit sufficiently varied frames on their own: heterogeneity at the group-level is not enough. Finally, the paper complements recent research on frames in the FOMC."
2020,"Perceived Differentiation and Audience Support to Institutional Change in British Politics -- Previous research suggests that insufficient differentiation of organizations occupying central positions in an organizational field increases the possibility of a status quo threatening institutional change. Directly testing the relationship, the present study reveals a more complex picture of the linkages between organizational differentiation and institutional change. Drawing on developments in British politics, our study demonstrates that when the differentiation dimension of left-right politics was on decline, perceived differentiation of the major parties, instead of decreasing, increased audience support to a status quo threatening- electoral institutional change from FPPS (First Past the Post System) to PR (Proportional Representation). We further observe in a counter-intuitive manner that the increase in audience support to the electoral institutional change from FPPS to PR, however, weakened with the passage of time. We use both qualitative and quantitative evidence from the context of British politics to support and test our theoretical arguments. In particular, we found support for our theoretical hypotheses in analyses of data from British Election Surveys during the period from 1987 to 2001, which enabled direct measurement of the perceived differentiation of the two central parties (i.e., the Conservatives and the Labour) in British politics along the differentiating dimension of left-right politics and the voter support for an electoral institutional change from FPPS to PR."
2020,"Material identity work and reinforcement of collective identity in times of loss -- The death of a central figure, like a charismatic founder, can dilute the sense of collective identity among the various stakeholders of a local community. Maintenance of collective identity can be a difficult task, because the organization needs to then simultaneously deal with multiple identity drifts. We conducted an inductive study of Finnish company Ponsse, the founder recently passed away. The second-generation chairman took the lead to articulate the values that implicitly prevailed during the leadership of the founder. Our findings show that organizations that experience a loss can maintain and strengthen their collective identity after the passing of a charismatic leader by engaging in material identity work. Our study highlights two phases underlying the process of reinforcing the collective identity: creating the material environment and enacting material experiences. We contribute to deepen current understanding of how collective identities can be reinforced after a major loss by illuminating the material underpinnings of identity work."
2020,"Multivocality in the emergence of impact investing in Spain: Creating new roles and responsibilities -- Interstitial issue fields offer important opportunities for collaboration across sectors, but they also pose significant challenges because field members come with diverse and often opposed value systems and evaluative criteria. Recent research has shown that multivocality can enable collaboration in such contexts, as it promotes coordination without the need for consensus. We explore these issues in the context of the emergence of impact investing in Spain, where we have carried out a field-level study based on interviews and continued participant observation, with especial emphasis on the case of social impact bonds. We find that multivocality is indeed relevant in the process of field emergence, but that it is through its interplay with calculability – reaching consensus over new calculative practices – that field members acquire new roles and responsibilities. We hence contribute to the literature on field emergence by showing the complementarity between multivocality and calculability, and to the literature on impact investing by suggesting how impact measurement and social impact bonds can drive significant changes in actors’ roles and accountability."
2020,"Does Collective always mean Cohesive? Collective Institutional Entrepreneurship and Radical Flanks -- Despite an expanding literature on collective institutional entrepreneurship, we know little about the mechanics and internal dynamics between different and potentially divergent entrepreneurial paths, the responses from actors outside the collective, and the effects that divergent entrepreneurial paths have on the outcome of the institutional change project. In this paper, we set out to explore how diverse paths in collective institutional entrepreneurship can contribute to institutional change. Informed by literature on collective institutional entrepreneurship and radical flank effects and relying on qualitative processual data on a collective attempt to change the standards in Type-1 diabetes healthcare, we show how multiple and diverse entrepreneurial paths interweave in the pursuit of a common institutional change project. We contribute to literature on collective institutional entrepreneurship by detailing the mechanisms that yield synergetic and dynamic relationships between entrepreneurial actors (creating urgency, creating the network and creating the cohesion) and by detailing how different types of institutional work undertaken by the different groups contribute to institutional change over time. We also contribute to literature on radical flank effects by demonstrating how emotional cohesion functions as a social glue that connects discrepant entrepreneurial paths in a common institutional change project."
2020,"Influence of different types of Reputation on Art investments: an Experimental Study -- In this paper we investigate how different types of reputation influence on the perceived investment potential of an artwork. To address this question, we conduct a 2x2x2 between-subjects anonymous online experiment. We examine the effects of expert, marker, and peer reputations of the perceived investment potential of an artwork. Moreover, we examine whether these effects depend on the visual attractiveness of an artwork. The results of our study extend our knowledge on the influence of social evaluations on art investments. We combine economic perspective on art markets (Campbell, 2009; Lovo, Spaenjers, 2018; Renneboog, Spaenjers, 2013; Worthington, Higgs, 2004) with research on social evaluations (Lange, Lee, Dai, 2011; Pollock et al., 2019; Rindova et al., 2005) by showing the importance of social evaluations for the investments decisions. Moreover, we extent research on multiplicity of reputations (Boutinot et al., 2017; Ertug et al., 2016; Fini et al., 2018; Jensen, Kim, Kim, 2011; Kim, Jensen, 2014) by clarifying the influence of different audience-specific reputations and showing that they can have both positive and negative effects on investment potential perceptions within art markets. Our study also contributes to the growing stream of literature on the commercialization of culture and commodification of art objects (Beckert, Rössel, 2013; Velthuis, 2007)."
2020,"Varieties of Moral Agency: Overcoming Moral Paralysis in Organizations -- In this paper, we introduce the concept of moral paralysis to explain a tendency to give priority to avoiding harm over doing good in particular organizational contexts. The discussion starts from an example from a nursing home, where a depressed resident is invited on a motorcycle trip to give her a positive and energizing experience. It illustrates an initiative to prioritize moral agency aiming to benefit another person over moral agency geared towards avoidance of harm. Informants to this study have indicated that moral agency of this kind is rare, since it involves a risk of causing harm, and a risk of professional repercussions if the outcome is negative. Moral paralysis occurs when decision-makers are reluctant to engage in prescriptive moral agency, due to a perceived lack of protection against negative consequences. We argue that previous theories have conflated prescriptive and proscriptive moral agency on the one hand, with action and inaction on the other, and propose a model that combines these two dimensions of moral agency. We also apply the concept of moral luck to explain the emergence of moral paralysis."
2020,"Sometimes More: The Effect of Preference Diversity on Exploration -- This study investigates how preference diversity affects the amount of exploration a prototypical organization – a majority voting triad – perform while learning in an uncertain environment. We employ a multi-agent-based model to study this question as an extension of the prior models on learning under uncertainty. We find that preference diversity (i.e. how different are the preferences of the least similar agents in the triad) can increase (+15%) or decrease exploration (-50%) when compared to triads with homogenous preferences. We find that when the diverse preferences are balanced (i.e., the median agent is equidistant to the other two agents) then exploration is higher. Conversely, exploration decreases when the preferences are imbalanced (i.e., two agents have preference close together). The paper explores further aspects that affect exploration, as organization size, preference polarization in larger organizations, and the type of environment. All further analyses maintain the general finding of the paper, namely: Preference diversity on its own does not explain the amount of exploration done by an organization."
2020,"The Cultural and Commercial Production of Leadership -- Scholars have long criticized the commercialization of leadership, leadership education, and leadership development—some to distinguish what they consider legitimate research and practice from mass-market “bullshit,” others to characterize the whole notion of leadership as an ideological ruse or empty signifier. But neither critique rests on an adequate foundation of theory or empirical research regarding the actors, institutions, and industries that drive and profit from the commercialization of leadership. We therefore draw from the production of culture literature, Pierre Bourdieu’s sociology of cultural fields, Roger Friedland’s critique of Bourdieu, and our own work on leadership fashions to develop a theoretical framework fit to explore the cultural and commercial production of concepts, discourses, products and services via the leadership industries. A deeper understanding of the competitive and industrial dynamics behind these industries promises to contribute fresh perspectives on the proliferation of so many approaches to leadership; on the industrialized production rather than just the social construction of those approaches; on the continued predominance of romanticized and individualized prescriptions over against more sociologically nuanced theories of relational and collective leadership; and on the central role that scholars themselves play in the leadership industries, and in the production and reproduction of leadership."
2020,"Cooperation and Competition within Organizations: A Multi-Level View -- In this article we examine simultaneous cooperation and competition within organizations, with a specific focus on teams and their members. We extend theory on how the different levels involved with ‘coopetition’ interact; how activity at one level influences activity at another level. Our approach of simulation-assisted theory building unpacks our overall contribution to understanding the multi-leveled nature of coopetition by illustrating three main insights. First, competition between two - or more - teams, encourages cooperation between team members who also compete with each other. Second, the relationship between value creation and appropriation is bidirectional; that is, creation at the level of the team influences appropriation at the level of the individual, and vice versa. Third, there are specific conditions under which selfishness, or ‘non-cooperation’, is optimal at the individual level, including the comparative extent of altruism at the team level, and the point in time at which such a strategy is leveraged. We primarily contribute to the coopetition literature. However, such theory also has implications for practice, as it informs managers how best to organize their teams for optimal value creation and performance."
2020,"Engaging with Institutional Voids in Contexts of Poverty: The African Wildlife Foundation in Kenya -- Drawing on a historical case study of the African Wildlife Foundation from 1960 to 2015, we propose a dynamic model of institutional void experience, enactment and theorization as guided by an evolving constellation of institutional logics. We show that micro-level practices embedded in particular institutional logics can collide with social reality and hamper the organization in achieving its mission (void experience), which prompts organizations to experiment with novel solutions embedded in seemingly opposite logics (void enactment) and leverage their organizational identity to legitimate these novel solutions (void theorization) in a cyclical manner. By adopting a social constructivist lens in studying voids, we provide a fresh perspective on institutional voids and address scholarly calls for a synthesis of international business and institutional theory. We also shed light on the role of agency in the emergence of logic constellations at the organizational field-level and emphasize the role of organizational identity as an enabling mechanism in this process."
2020,"How Do We Find Meaningfulness in Work? A Process Theory Based on the Dialogic Practice -- Experiencing work as meaningful is a central desire for individuals in organizations, but scholars face three challenges that together hinder research progress. Current works on work meaningfulness (WM) fall short in: (1) conceptualizing the inherently processual nature of WM; (2) accounting for the social, other-oriented dimension in WM process; and (3) addressing the tensional and paradoxical nature of WM. We argue that these are interrelated issues arising from the dominance of representational ontology in WM research, and propose the adoption of relational ontology in addressing them. Blending practice approach and dialogic perspective, we develop a dialogic practice theory of WM and generate three central insights. We theorize that, firstly, a person’s WM emerges in the purposive engagement in practices and changes in his/her becoming aware of the inherent tensions and contradictions in such engagement. Secondly, this awareness prompts the person to re-evaluate his/her purposive engagement and justification. Thirdly, this re-evaluation leads to the differential positioning of the self in relation with and in contrast to others through inquiring, selecting, and crafting the self-other dialogues. In sum, this cycle of purposive engagement, awareness, re-evaluation, and differential positioning suggests a theoretical model that captures the social, processual, and tensional nature of WM."
2020,"The Impact of Peer and Industry Characteristics on Peer Failure Experience and Investment Intensity -- Most studies on learning from failure have focused on the strategic incentives of a focal firm. We examine the relationship between peer failure and investment intensity from external actors’ point of view and argue that peer failure can be a negative signal to external actors due to a harm spill-over effect, restricting a firm’s actions. Our analysis of the U.S. movie industry shows that peer failure leads to a decrease in investment intensity, the relationship attenuated by peer recognition and industry growth. Our study highlights the role of external actors that shape a firm’s ability to learn and take action."
2020,"Reproduction by decoupled innovation -- This paper analyzes how new ideas imported to an institutional field in crisis as solutions to efficiency demands can sustain organizational conformity. Studying the exemplary case of a highly acclaimed innovation project in a leading legacy newspaper, my findings suggest that, even in conditions of decreasing organizational efficiency and apparent institutional failure, the transposition of new ideas can reproduce existing institutional arrangements. The process model I propose explains how this happens in a process of empty translation that removes diverging meaning from imported ideas, decoupling the transposed policy from actual practice. The suggested theoretical model provides insights to translation and decoupling micro-level dynamics and their effect on isomorphism."
2020,"How to learn from the man in the mirror: Navigating paradoxes through self-reflexivity -- In the light of increased organizational and environmental complexity, research turns ever more often to the notion of paradox to investigate how managers can navigate conflicting demands. However, the internal dynamics of paradox remain unclear, making it difficult to understand what exactly is meant by the concept, and how it can be managed in practice. This article notes that the full potential of paradox as an analytical tool for understanding complex situations of organizational life has not been reached, and reveals instances of organizational complexity that appear even more radical than current definitions of paradox posit. Using the sociologist Niklas Luhmann’s concepts of distinction and re-entry, we unfold the complexity of such situations and develop a typology that includes a novel type of paradox that appears underexplored. Illustrating several different ways that opposites can appear interdependent, interwoven, persistent, and synergistic, we contribute to theory-building within paradox research. Finally, we discuss our findings and managerial implications and point towards future research."
2020,"With Frenemies Like These: Social Networks Ties and Interpersonal Citizenship Behaviors -- This study examines the relationship between the type of social network tie shared between two individuals—positive, negative, or ambivalent multiplex (both positive and negative tie components)—and the performance of interpersonal citizenship behavior (ICB), a form of individually-targeted organizational citizenship behavior. Drawing from ego depletion theory, social exchange theory, and the social functions of emotions perspective, we argue that dyadic relational qualities influence the individual’s decision to perform ICBs. Further, based on social categorization theory and social information processing theory, we posit that the number of positive alters a dyad shares increases the probability of ICB. We test the theoretical model in a study including 48 employees of a supplier organization for large retailers and food service companies using exponential random graph models (ERGMs). Results offer support for the hypothesized relationships, and the practical implications, as well as future research questions, are addressed."
2020,"Buffering and bridging under institutional complexity - A configurational approach towards CVC -- Corporate Venture Capital (CVC) units are hybrid organizations facing multiple institutional demands and inconsistent organizational goals. By employing a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) of 23 CVC units, we empirically explore how these hybrids configure and design their organizational structure to respond to institutional complexity and sustain hybridity over time. We identify two contextual variables - maturity and strategic focus - that influence how these hybrid organizations organize for high strategic performance. We find that successful responses of organizations facing institutional complexity are multifaceted, dynamic, and change over time as strategy and stakeholder demands vary. We contribute to institutional theory by introducing the concept of buffering and bridging to explain how successful hybrid organizations distance themselves from the institutional logic they originate when they become more mature (buffering). At the same time, they increase their efforts to maintain connections to representatives of the logic they stem from (bridging)."
2020,"Product Experience and Learning to Identify Opportunities: Evidence from Mobile App Developers -- This paper examines how firms identify opportunities from their product development experience and how such learning affects the launch of subsequent products. I develop a theoretical framework that focuses on how the breadth and depth of experience provides information on opportunities in uncertain environments. Specifically, I created the concept of functionality that captures what purposes firms’ products provide for the customers. I predict that product experience allows firms to learn about the underlying functionalities and they use such information to guide subsequent product launches. Using fine-grained data on mobile application developers in the US Apple Store ecosystem, I find that firms with greater functionality breadth in their prior product experience are more likely to launch new product, and the effect is largely in firms’ core functionalities rather than peripheral and new ones. In particular, these new product launches tend to highlight more of these core functionalities as opposed to recombining with new functionalities. These findings suggest that in uncertain environments, experience breadth has the surprising merit of enabling firms to gain greater clarity in their core functionalities through establishing the boundaries and connections of different functionalities."
2020,"How to Stay Weird – The Normative Subordination of Profits in a Firm Striving for Sustainability -- Humanity faces an unprecedented urgency to act in order to achieve sustainable development. Against this background, firms play an ambivalent role, since they have great potential to contribute to sustainable development, but their common normative focus on profit maximization leads to increasing rather than decreasing sustainability problems. Whereas integrative and paradox research on sustainability breaks away from the instrumentalism underlying profit maximization, research still lacks a theoretical account of firms enacting sustainability more radically, even at the expense of economic success. With an in-depth ethnographic study, this paper investigates a natural cosmetic producing firm that normatively superordinates ecological and social considerations over profits in its practices. We take a practice-based approach and unearth how firms are able to maintain a radical focus on sustainability in several practices through a recursive, tension-mitigating mechanism spiraled by highly sustainability-oriented selling and supplier management practices. This paper contributes to research on sustainability in organization and management studies by discovering approaches that enable firms to superordinate ecological and social ends over profits in multiple practices and thereby contribute to the urgent radical shift towards sustainability."
2020,"Category-Featuring Names and Analyst Reactions to Corporate Environmental Actions -- In this study, we develop a novel mechanism through which nonconforming organizations can survive and thrive. Building on recent developments in categories literature, we propose that audiences’ category taken-for-grantedness, evoked by firms’ category-featuring names, opens strategic opportunities for firms to escape from audiences’ illegitimate discounts and even retain audiences’ enhanced valuation. We test our predictions using security analysts’ reactions to Chinese public firms’ environmental actions between 2008 and 2014. Our findings demonstrate that a firm’s explicit feature in its name that shaped by historical categorization can have profound impacts on analysts’ legitimacy and value judgments of contemporary corporate behaviors."
2020,"Why informal firms formalize: A strategic decision-making perspective -- We offer a behavioural framework to explain informal firms’ decision to formalize. We argue that aspirations for which firms skirt formal regulation to operate in the informal economy serve as reference points in interpreting and evaluating the prospect of formalization. We differentiate between the influences of firms expected performance relative to aspired performance and the influence of different form of aspiration being pursued (aspirations related to subsistence, exploitation, legacy, and resistance). In conclusion, we contribute to extant research emphasizing formalization as a quasi-rational calculation by recognizing how formalization can be seen as a complex decisions-making process surrounded by severe information incompleteness and uncertainty."
2020,"Making paradoxical tensions salient: changing information not people -- Many firms are confronted with paradoxical tensions. For firms to recognize tensions these have to become salient. Prior research suggests that environmental and cognitive factors render latent tensions salient and argues implicitly that where environmental factors are complex, paradoxical cognition is required. In this paper we present the general model of rendering paradoxical tensions salient where developing cognition is only one of three possible strategies. We argue that information must fit both a described situation and actors’ cognition for latent tensions to become salient. Based on this condition we introduce the other two alternative ways to make tensions salient, i.e. simplification of the information and simplification of the situation, that have been overlooked by scholars. Using the doubly complex application of coopetition for sustainability we show how the strategy of simplification of the information can help to recognize and systemize paradoxical tensions."
2020,"Integration of Competing Logics through Anchoring and Recontextualization -- Integration of organizational elements from competing institutional logic archetypes can provide tremendous value for society through the hybrid organization. Despite these potential benefits, most work on hybrid integration stops at inclusion of elements within the organization with subsequent isolation or leaves the relationships within and between organizational elements under-explored. Within two social enterprises striving to attain social and financial objectives in the context of resource-poor solar energy markets, we show that integration within the hybrid organization is facilitated through anchoring on a logic archetype, empowerment of the non-anchor logic, and recontextualization of each of the non-anchor elements included. Recontextualization within the anchored organizational configuration enabled using the non-anchor elements in ways that shifted from independent contentious trade-offs to supportive interdependent complements. The emergence and supporting evidence are given along with a discussion of theoretical and practical implications"
2020,"Learning What They Think vs. Learning What They Do: Two Mechanisms of Vicarious Learning -- Vicarious learning is a vital component of organizational learning. However, as new technologies emerge that have the potential to improve vicarious learning among individuals and between humans and algorithms, our lack of conceptual clarity about it’s underlying mechanisms may impede our ability to benefit from them. We theorize and model two fundamental processes underlying vicarious learning: observation of actions (learning what they do) vs. belief sharing (learning what they think). The analysis of our model points to two key insights. First, vicarious learning through belief sharing is not universally better than simple mutual observation of actions and outcomes. Specifically, enabling mutual observability of actions and outcomes is superior to sharing of beliefs when the task environment features few alternatives with large differences in their value and there are no time pressures. Second, the superiority of vicarious learning through belief sharing in more complex task environments with time constraints does not require any differential wisdom ex ante among the learners. Both results are shown to be the consequence of a key mechanism – how vicarious learning affects self-confirming biases."
2020,"Some Organizational Antecedents of Evil -- Employees sometimes engage in acts of evil, particularly towards people under their care or control. Using a situationist perspective, we examine the sadistic abuse of vulnerable patients by care home staff. Our theory links organizational control to pathways to abuse. Observations on 14,000 care homes between 2006-2014 show that the neglect of patients, minor rule breaches, and physical restraint escalate into active sadistic behavior. A lack of both informal and formal monitoring mechanisms gives rise to these gradual pathways, although forms of formal supervision – both by managers and team leaders – largely fail to curtail the abuse. Whereas prior research focused on how organizational measures around control, rules, and monitoring can unleash positive employee behaviors such as creativity, our findings indicate that organizational context can also unleash the darker inclinations in human behavior."
2020,"Coordination of Search: A Processual Approach -- Coordination of search by several agents when interdependencies and uncertainty characterize the environment is a difficult yet critical task. The core difficulty, compared to search by a single agent, is for each agent to take into account the other’s actions and choices in her own learning process. A well-known solution to this problem is building a common knowledge. Common knowledge provides a complete framework in which each agent can make sense of the problem at hand and of the other’s actions. Yet, several recent case studies evidence that coordination of search is possible even when building common knowledge is impossible. These studies show that adopting a processual approach to coordination, i.e. varying the behavior of agents over time, permits efficient search without common knowledge. We resort to a computational model to investigate the conditions under which a processual coordination of search can be successful. We vary over time two key dimensions: the nature of agents’ cognitive effort (i.e. whether they explore or try to converge towards a common solution) and interactions (i.e. the extent to which they are tolerant to errors). Our results show that a processual coordination of search is efficient when agents first only explore with a maximum tolerance to errors and then purely converge towards a common solution while progressively reducing their tolerance to errors. The key to the success of the multiagent search is that, from one agent perspective, the others’ behaviors are stabilized so that they can be handled in conducting one’s own learning process."
2020,"Working with the ‘Enemy’: Free Space in Facilitating Cold War Space Collaboration -- Although collaboration between competing organizations is one of the most challenging tasks in management, our knowledge about social-cognitive mechanisms that facilitate the collaborative interaction between members of competing organizations is rather limited. We conducted an inductive, interpretive historical case study of the collaboration between the US and USSR space programs during the Cold War. Our study uncovers a process by which individuals used a “free space,” i.e., social space in which organizational members cognitively severed themselves from the higher-level ideological/political tension by initiating and maintaining informal and isolated interactions with their collaborative counterparts. The concept of “free space” has profound implications for analyzing effective collaboration between competing organizations in both market and nonmarket contexts."
2020,"Configuration of Institutional Entrepreneurial Opportunities -- The paper develops a middle-range theory - rooted in the ‘configuration’ principles of sociology and organization theory - to explain how the different configurations of macro institutional and micro individual conditions trigger different actions that begin distinct IEO creation processes. It is theorized that during the opportunity creation process, micro and macro conditions may change, giving rise to new configurations. Our conceptualization of multiple types of configurations that trigger individual actions in parallel and in sequence that, when successful, together lead to the creation of the demand and/or solution(s) for institutional change advances a granular understanding of the triggering of the moving forward of institutional change. In particular, this theorization provides a framework to fulfill our knowledge gap to systematically study the heterogeneity in the triggering of actions and their evolution in the institutional entrepreneurial opportunity creation process."
2020,"Organizational learning of cultures: The spawned culture effects in the U.S. IT industry -- Scholars often compare new ventures to babies, but most founders are experienced and enculturated even if their startups are young—a paradox of new ventures. New ventures start in a cultural void, but their founders are often already encultured to the parent organization’s cultural codes. This study investigates whether founders fill the cultural void with the cultural repertoires of their parent organization. Founders enculturated in prior employment are more likely to adopt familiar cultural repertoires, resulting in a spawned startup becoming culturally similar to its parent. This spawned culture effect is stronger when founders are more socialized (have longer tenure), when the parent culture is more legitimate (less atypical) and coherent (has high cultural congruency). Finally, this study explores which cultural repertoires predict better performance and whether those are more likely to be inherited by spawned startups. If less likely to be inherited, this implies that organizational culture can be a source of a firm’s competitive advantage. These ideas are examined in a longitudinal analysis of 3,570 startups in the U.S. IT industry from 2008 through 2019. Implications for the study of organizational learning, organizational culture, and entrepreneurship are discussed."
2020,"Antecedents of general manager successions in multinational enterprise subsidiaries -- This study examines the dynamics of general manager (GM) succession in the foreign subsidiaries of multinational enterprises (MNEs). First, drawing on insights from evolutionary theory and the organizational learning literature, we argue that MNEs are adaptive organizations such that prior subsidiary GM changes at the “intra” regional level decrease the probability of further GM change in the focal subsidiary. Our logic is that the accumulated context-specific knowledge may allow MNEs to further develop extant succession routines. Second, in the context at the “inter” regional level, given the high spatial transaction costs, what are more likely to be applied to the focal subsidiary are standardized succession processes, which are less likely to accommodate the situations specific to the focal subsidiary. Due to the reduced marginal costs of making similar changes, prior GM successions that occurred outside the region where the focal subsidiary operates accelerate the momentum for further GM change in this subsidiary. Third, we propose that when changing from a parent-country national to a host-country national GM, succession routines may be refined in order to accommodate particular candidates or particular search committees, which in turn decelerates the momentum for further subsidiary GM change. A fixed effects longitudinal analysis of 1,169 Japanese subsidiary firms between 1995 and 2013 provides empirical evidence to support these arguments."
2020,"Innovating beyond: Social innovation as extra-organizational innovation -- Today’s grand challenges call for innovations that enhance societal problem solving. Such innovations unlike conventional “organizational innovation” are not exclusively meant to improve innovators’ position in the marketplace through increasing customer satisfaction. Instead, the innovations need to (1) incorporate action on different levels of society, including policy or public discourse, and (2) address and involve a broader range of actors to lead to improved social outcomes. Social innovation is a prototype of such “extra-organizational innovation”. I use microfinance as a prime example of social innovation to theorize it as extra-organizational innovation by means of Giddens’ structuration theory. I develop a theoretical model and research propositions on innovation (a) mechanisms, (b) actors, and (c) effects that highlight how social innovation is systematically different from organizational innovation. I extend my theorizing to how structuration can help understand other new types of innovation that can be considered extra-organizational on at least one of the two accounts, the magnitude of actors or the multitude of levels of action involved. These types include open innovation, entrepreneurship as method and institutional innovation."
2020,"A Strategy-as-Practice Perspective on Stakeholder Management -- Stakeholder management is part of the day-to-day activities of managers. Yet, we currently know much more about stakeholder management outcomes than how managers actually consider and balance stakeholder needs. Drawing on an inductive analysis of mixed-methods data from 353 Dutch philanthropic organizations, this paper unpacks the practice of stakeholder management. Informed by a strategy-as-practice lens, which has fruitfully advanced other branches of strategy research, it unpacks what stakeholder management practices look like, how and why managers enact them, and the consequences for stakeholders in terms of prioritization versus harmonization of their needs. We contribute to stakeholder theory by developing a new descriptive and empirically informed understanding of how managers deal with stakeholder demands. By identifying distinct ways in which managers deal with stakeholders, while moving beyond opposite cultural or moral pre-configurations as the foundational explanation, we take important steps towards explaining variation within as well as across stakeholder management approaches."
2020,"Burning the Bridges: Authenticity, Innovation and Transgression in Norwegian Black Metal -- This study explores the dark side of an inherently positive construct - authenticity. Posing conformity (reproducing essential features) and differentiation (asserting distinctive features) as alternative routes to achieving authenticity, we document the escalation of the latter into normative violation. Escalation is the refusal of compromise as a way of reducing the gap between private self and public display. The research context is Norwegian black metal, unprecedented in music history in elevating extremity to a core principle of construction of artistic and collective identities. We examine two forms of escalation - as innovation in music and transgression (i.e. church burnings). Escalation was mediated through the exclusion and self-exclusion of actors with lower tolerance for extremity. Its substantive importance is in adding a layer of complexity to evaluation. That black metal’s connection to crime has contributed to its endurance suggests that escalating action defying normative scripts can be attributed authenticity when interpreted as sincere and consistent embodiment of alternative values. We paint a large canvass of the escalation process by drawing on examples in history, fiction and politics."
2020,"Off the Beaten Path: Asocial Exploration in Managerial Decision-making -- The process of search focuses on identifying new solutions. When we define a new solution as a choice that an individual has not yet identified as a viable alternative, novelty may be derived from two fundamentally distinct processes: either from search undertaken in isolation from others or from the adoption of solutions that others have already explored. We refer to the former process of search as asocial exploration and to the latter as social exploration. In our experimental study, we examine the behavior of individuals who are given the opportunity to choose between social and asocial exploration, in the face of failure. After reporting on the relative levels of these two forms of search, we seek to identify conditions within the social environment that can elevate individuals’ propensity to engage in asocial exploration. Our focus is on evaluations of choices that result in negative outcomes. We find that, under conditions of failure, asocial exploration is greater when individuals receive positive evaluations of past choices. We also find that this pattern is particularly pronounced among highly narcissistic managers."
2020,"Standing on the shoulders of giants: How star scientists influence their co-authors -- Despite prior research that supports the link between collaborations with star scientists and their co-workers’ productivity, empirical findings on this relationship are surprisingly mixed. To address this, we theorize and empirically disentangle two mechanisms through which star peer effects can occur: a collaboration can convey a direct peer effect by acting as a pipe, through which ideas and knowledge are conveyed from a star to her co-workers, or an indirect peer effect by acting as a prism, meaning that a collaboration with a star signals the quality of her collaborators’ work to others. To investigate this, we examine the effect of collaborating on scientific publications with a star who either won, or was nominated for but did not win, the Nobel Prize in Physics. We use the death of a star to isolate pipes and do not find that the co-authors of Nobel Prize winners publish fewer articles than the co-authors of Nobel Prize nominees. Isolating prisms, we find that the articles of the co-authors of Nobel Prize winners that were published prior to the focal co-author’s first collaboration with the winner receive a citation boost after the Nobel Prize is awarded, relative to the co-authors of Nobel Prize nominees. Using an innovative measure of the recognition of pioneering research, we find that this difference in citations causes articles written by the co-authors of Nobel Prize nominees to experience a delay in recognition. Our results clarify how stars contribute to their co-workers’ productivity and provide evidence of the benefits that can arise from indirect peer effects."
2020,"Social Attribution of Collaborative Outcomes: A Study of Status Dynamics in Jazz Music Industry -- This study examines how social recognition of collaborative outcomes affects status gain of actors. While research on status dynamics suggests that actors may enhance their status by producing desirable outcomes or by collaborating with high-status actors, understanding the influence of collaborative outcomes is problematic because actors in a collaborative relationship take varying status positions and gain only partial credit for their collaborative outcomes. Drawing from attribution theory, we suggest that while desirable outcomes and collaborating with higher-status actors tend to increase a focal actor’s status individually, collaborations with higher-status actors result in gaining less credit for the desirable outcomes because audiences tend to attribute the desirable outcomes more to the higher-status collaborators and less to the lower-status actor. Analyzing collaboration networks among jazz musicians between 1950 and 2004, we found the negative moderation effect of collaborator status on gaining status from desirable collaborative outcomes; musicians gain less status from receiving positive ratings from critics and from creating novel repertoires when they collaborate with actors who have higher status than them. This finding highlights the audiences’ credit allocation to the contributors in status evaluation and reveals underexplored processes in status dynamics."
2020,"Toward a Dynamic Perspective on Organizational Authenticity -- Prior research has investigated organizational authenticity by considering the underlying consistency between internal values and external expressions as persistent and static, thus neglecting its temporal dimension. In this study, we provide a richer consideration of the processual nature of organizational authenticity, through an empirical investigation of how it evolves over time. We do so by conducting an in-depth qualitative case study of Masi Agricola, a seventh-generation family-owned Italian wine producer. Our analysis revealed that, when facing episodes of authenticity struggle, the organization experienced a first phase of authenticity drifting, including those actions that underpinned the perception of inconsistency between values and practices and the organization displaying such discrepancy. This was critical to facilitate the organizational reaction, ensuing a new phase of authenticity grafting to establish new links of consistency. Our findings and theoretical insights advance the current understanding of the temporal dimension of organizational authenticity, challenging the prevailing view of a linear process of authenticity restoration, and providing new insights on the dichotomy between consistency and inconsistency as an instrumental dynamic in connecting values with practices."
2020,"Deliberate vs. spontaneous networking behaviors and information search: An interactive experiment -- While networking is frequently characterized in terms of dichotomous sets of behaviors, little is known about how individuals find a balance between them. This omission is especially striking in contexts where these dichotomies present themselves as trade-offs, forcing networking individuals to choose between opposing types of behaviors. Networking events are a prime example of such a context, as participants are concurrently searching for information and act as targets of others’ search efforts. We focus on two of the dichotomies that are most relevant in such social context – deliberate versus spontaneous as well as selfish versus altruistic networking – to examine how and why individuals respond differently to these trade-offs, and to evaluate the effectiveness of the observed approaches. We do so by way of an interactive networking experiment, which includes random assignment into treatment groups of varying levels of background knowledge, as well as real-time tracking of participants’ movement using sociometric badges. Our results allow us to differentiate between two routes taken by networking participants: a direct, deliberate and selfish one of information exploitation, and an indirect, spontaneous and altruistic one of information gathering, both of which may be understood as integral parts of the same cyclical process. We conclude by discussing the theoretical implications of our study."
2020,"Trust can blind and distrust can aid: Watchful blindness under interpartner uncertainty -- Although studies on trust as an organizing principle have advanced our understanding of organizing in the context of interdependency and uncertainty, research has not yet explored the distinct roles of trust and distrust, and how they simultaneously, and synergistically affect interorganizational interactions under interpartner uncertainty. We enrich the theorizing based on a case study of the Swedish robotics and automation ecosystem where interpartner uncertainty—due to complex interdependencies, frequent coopetitive interactions, and temporal alignment of actors in multiple projects—is a key organizing challenge. We identify distinct orienting and enabling mechanisms of trust and distrust respectively, which both individually and synergistically support firms in maintaining fruitful interactions in the face of uncertainty. Furthermore, we integrate the mechanisms of trust and distrust into a model explaining how trust and distrust as organizing principles interact to give rise to watchful blindness."
2020,"Inception point: Combining institutional complexity and strategy-as-practice for strategizing -- This paper examines the intersection between institutional theory and strategy, and more specifically, institutional complexity and strategy-as-practice, to further our understanding of how organizations can effectively respond to multiple, and often conflicting, institutional pressures. We present an in-depth case study of a UK-headquartered commercial law firm, documenting how the firm has navigated the ongoing shift from a once traditional legal field dominated by the professional logic, to a more fluid situation, characterized by the increasing encroachment of the market logic. Our study brings together the macro approach of institutional complexity and the micro processes of strategy to offer multiple contributions. In particular, we further current literature on organizational strategic responses by showing that multiple strategies can co-exist within one firm at a given time, and we highlight the potential of talk as a medium through which organizational response strategies are initially brought into being."
2020,"Filling the Void: How Occupational Authority Emerges from Curating Learning Algorithms -- The data-driven, statistical, and opaque nature of learning algorithms makes them distinct from previous technologies. They are speculated to be consequential for work and organizing, but how they are reconfiguring work practices is not yet fully understood. Building on a 31-month ethnographic study of predictive policing, a learning algorithm to predict crime chances, we find that its implementation was associated with the unexpected growth in authority of an occupational group (“intelligence officers”). Our process analysis finds that this change in authority was triggered by the knowledge gap that emerged between the algorithmic outputs and the police work domain. Because intelligence officers could not open the blackboxed algorithm, they instead tried to bridge the knowledge gap by means of “algorithmic curation” practices, thereby offering their own predictions and backgrounding the learning algorithm. This approach to “fill the void” reinforced the knowledge gap and kept management assuming that the predictions were made by the algorithm, which increased the authority of intelligence officers over police work allocation. Our findings offer contributions to the emerging literature on the influence of algorithmic technology on work and to the literature on occupational authority. Next to this, we provide insights into studying learning algorithms in practice."
2020,"Inside the stigma panzer: Organizational members’ emotional work in response to organizational event -- We investigate how organizational members manage their emotional experiences of organizational event stigma as an implication of organizational wrongdoing. Our research is based on a longitudinal case study of Best Bank, that has been involved in a money laundering scandal of historical magnitude. Our study of organizational members shows how their pride and organizational loyalty makes them develop a ‘stigma panzer’, i.e. a number of emotional responses when at work as well as at home, that serves to protect them against the negative implications of the event stigmatization. We show how the stigma panzer may benefit the individual employee facing the event stigma at work, while we question if this emotional stigma panzer at home is also beneficial for the organization. We conclude by calling for more stigma research to understand better the implications of emotions at work and at home for organizational stigma related to organizational wrongdoing."
2020,"Lonely At The Top? CEO Sensemaking In The Boardroom -- Amidst the uncertainty and ambiguity characterizing CEO’s role, issues or events that are “novel, ambiguous, confusing, or in some other way violate expectations” (Maitlis & Christianson, 2014: 57) mobilize CEOs to seek information and to challenge their - and others’ - understanding. Drawing on in-depth qualitative interviews with 146 global CEOs, we conduct a micro-level analysis of how CEOs seek, process and make sense of information via their interactions with the TMT and others as part of their decision-making process. We explore the interchangeable and power-charged process of sensedemanding and sensemaking through which meaning-making and eventually decision-making occur. The process involves CEOs (nominally) conceding some of their power and voice to others, before retaining them prior to making a decision. CEOs invite dissension and hence, also invite multivocality (and as a result also equivocality) from their environment and seek to test or validate sensemaking and crystalize it into decisions. Our findings unpack the micro-dynamics of CEO decision-making drawing on the CEO-TMT interface, managerial cognition and decision-making literatures."
2020,"Settle Down or the Struggle Within: A Multiple Case-Study of Organizational Character Development -- Using a multiple-case study of two financial services firms in the Netherlands, we explain how organizational character develops when new commitments are articulated and extant commitments are maintained. We found that commitments become expressed as a result of the perceived organizational past, envisioned organizational future, and as a result of pressure from internal subgroups. Because these commitments were made salient to managers, tensions became manifest, leading to various forms of struggle. Four interrelated dynamics underlie this state of struggle, which we termed emerging dilemmas, organizational identity clarity, ambiguous or superficial commitments and structural differentiation. In such context, the enactment of three stabilizing practices, specifically, substantive integrative work, routinizing a collective conscience and leaders’ modeling behaviors, contributed to commitment affirmation or commitment violation, providing the opportunity for further anchoring these commitments in organizational character. In elaborating theory around these actions, we contribute to scholarly and practitioners understanding around how organizations may improve in embedding contradictory commitments within organizational boundaries and rejuvenate the study of organizations as value-infused social actors."
2020,"Organizational Failure as a Value Judgement: A Review and Reconceptualization -- While organizational failure has been a central concept in the broader Management field for some time, the question of how to conceptualize organizational failure remains widely debated. We review previous reconceptualizations of organizational failure, and subsequently propose to conceptualize failure as a value judgement. As a value judgement, we argue, fail-ure is a relational concept of the fifth degree. This means that organizational failure is related to (a) the state of an organization, (b) somebody who assesses the situation, (c) with regard to certain aspects, (d) specific circumstances, and (e) in view of a goal. This reconceptualization shifts the discourse on failure from considering it as a state of an organization (e.g., insolven-cy, bankruptcy), or an event (e.g., closure, termination, cessation) (i.e., ontological concepts) towards studying organizational failure as a value judgement (i.e., axiological concept). Conceptualizing failure as a value judgement helps to differentiate failure from related concepts such as organizational decline, organizational error and others."
2020,"Categorization and Organizational Evolution: A Species Approach to Organizational Form -- Organizational evolution has become a keystone of wider organizational sciences as it seeks to understand the emergence and sustained presence of organizational forms within the econosystem. Rooted in a population ecology approach to evolutionary theory, the field is presented with the key issue of how to draw the boundaries between organizational forms and thus delimit populations. Despite this centrality, development of a cogent classificatory scheme that meets the demands of both the philosophy of science and social ontology has been elusive. In this paper I integrate the concept of natural kinds taken from philosophy of science with allegory to the ecological niche to formulate an Organizational Species Concept which accommodates these demands. I operationalize this framework through cluster analysis and an abductive process of exploratory science. This is applied to a unique national data set covering an emergent organizational form in food systems, the “food hub”, as a proof of concept. This application carries policy import for goals that center food hubs within initiatives to scale up local and regional food systems. Through this application, I show how determinations about organizational form and underlying populations can be made."
2020,"Imprinting Risky Behavior: The Institutional Origins of Bank CEO Risk-Taking -- Commercial banks in the United States have taken on more risk since the 1980s, in line with a shift in the dominant business model in the field, from one emphasizing financial stability to one promoting greater risk-taking to maximize shareholder value. But why did certain banks embrace risky strategies more actively than others? Combining insights from the upper echelons perspective and imprinting theory, we argue that bank CEOs who absorbed the principles of shareholder value maximization through MBA education and started their banking career in the post-deregulation era pursued risk-taking more aggressively than other CEOs. We test this argument using data on 194 large commercial banks from 1993 to 2015. Our analysis shows that CEOs with an MBA who entered banking after the mid-1980s were heavier users of brokered deposits—a riskier funding source that contributed to bank instability during the 2007-2009 credit crisis. They also contributed to the use of brokered deposits indirectly by promoting shareholder-value prescriptions known to boost incentives for managerial risk-taking. By highlighting the role that organizational decision-makers—and their institutionally-embedded cognitive orientations—play in driving the uptake of risky strategies, our study contributes to the literatures on corporate risk-taking and institutional change."
2020,"Auto-tuned and R-Squared: Quality Evaluations and Organizing Creativity -- While navigating the subjective and differing quality evaluations of a range of actors has been identified as a fundamental feature of creative processes, how audience perceptions of quality are navigated in the creative process remains under-theorized. We examine this question through a comparative ethnography of two settings where big data brings audience quality evaluations to the fore—Nashville music production and systems biology cancer research. We find that actors encounter a fundamental tension between the perfection and authenticity of creative outcomes that manifests in two competing standards of quality: the raw, empirically grounded, and authentic versus the technically processed, improved and refined. We show how these standards are negotiated vis-a-vis three different audiences – internal peers, extended community, and external reviewers – and identify implications for the literatures on collective creativity as well as audience evaluations."
2020,"Competing for Good? Conceptualizing how Social Enterprises Categorize and Respond to One Another -- Although there is a sizable literature on how organizations strategically respond to similar organizations, it is unclear how many of the associated prescriptions apply in the context of social enterprise, given these organizations’ focus on creating social value and assumptions of their cooperative propensity. Through a qualitative study of 46 leaders in the second-hand textiles market we surface a model of categorization in this setting that exposes how and why moral distinctions between organizations get noticed and thus encourage a broader set of inter-organizational responses. Our findings and model extend theory regarding how strategic managers form mental models of their competitive landscape, illustrating that rivalry does not merely entail attempts to appropriate value and generate competitive advantage but also political efforts involving collective identity maintenance."
2020,"Organizational risk-taking in the context of ambiguity -- How do firms adjust their exposure to local market risks when those risks suddenly become ambiguous? Behavioral theories of risk-taking (e.g. Audia and Greve 2006, March and Shapira 1992) offer little guidance. They implicitly assume that the interpretations of organizational performance problems that trigger changes in risk-taking are unambiguous. This paper argues that firms that are confronted with ambiguity produced by rare shocks ignore historic performance feedback when adjusting their risk exposure to the affected region. Instead, firms rely on firm-wide insolvency thresholds, local social performance comparisons, and local market signals to guide their risk adjustments. The statistical analysis of an original panel dataset of homeowner insurance underwriting behavior in the U.S. between 1992 and 2012 supports this argument. Critically, however, it also demonstrates that a greater reliance on social learning in such circumstance is contingent on the unavailability of legitimatized means of forecasting future risk exposure. The institutionalization of hurricane forecasting models in insurance markets reduced reliance on such social learning and directly altered risk-taking. The paper contributes to efforts to better understand the scope condition and dynamics of problemistic search and learning processes and their impact on organizational risk-taking and adaptive behavior."
2020,"Distinctiveness through categories: Generalization and the exploration of novel options -- Understanding how novel ideas are evaluated and recognized is important for organizational prosperity. A systematic evaluative bias against novel options after a negative experience - known as the ‘hot stove effect’ - may prevent organizations from engaging in enough explorations to identify novel ideas. We show that the adverse consequences of the hot-stove effect can be reduced by manipulating how novel options are categorized. The core of our mechanism is that categorization of options in more categories reduces the generalization of negative experience to other options, whereas categorization in fewer options favors such generalization. We develop predictions based on a computational model and test these in a behavioral experiment (N=302). The task environment is a setting in which participants decide between a known ‘status quo’ option and six unknown, novel options. Participants are randomly allocated into three conditions that vary in terms of the number of categories to which the novel options belong. If the six novel options belong to six distinct categories, the propensity to explore is significantly higher than when options belong to fewer categories. When all novel options belong to the same category, participant are most likely to avoid exploration. Our findings suggests new ways managers could favor, or prevent, exploration of novel options by organizational members."
2020,"The boiled frog in organizational learning: Sensing, adapting to and surviving environmental change -- Radical change in a firm’s environment is often viewed as discontinuous. We introduce the concept of continuous radical change by which old beliefs are rendered fallacious at an incremental pace. We theorize that incremental change can be as harmful as discontinuous change because it can remain undetected for too long by incumbent organizations. Specifically, we argue for a curvilinear relationship between the pace of environmental change and the organizational lifespan. We test out predictions using data from some 31,000 restaurants in the New York City Metropolitan area between the years 2007-2018. We use a fixed effects regression model to test for differences in the lifespan of restaurants located in areas of slow but radical gentrification versus those located in areas with accelerated and radical gentrification. We find support for an inverted U-shape between the pace of gentrification and restaurant lifespan. We explore whether this relationship is driven by differences in restaurants’ adaptation behavior."
2020,"Clean your desk! Dressage and activity-based working in a French banking organization -- As part of popular new kinds of activity-based working, many companies seek to implement so-called clean-desk policies, in which users have to empty their desk after completing a task, so that other workers can feel free to use this desk. Following Henri Lefebvre’s discussion of ‘Dressage’ in the context of Rhytm-analysis (Lefebvre 2004 [1992]), we argue that clean desk policies are part of a wider organizational strategy in flexibilizing working practices, focusing on the performative management of bodily and material aspects of work demonstrating control over these aspects. In drawing on a case study of a French Bank, which introduced a flexible working environment in 2016-2018, and following Lefebvre’s ideas, we argue that and how dressage can be understood as a separate but key component in the domination and embodiment of flexiblized work practices."
2020,"Shared values and social value creation in a nascent organization -- We address a central gap in our understanding of social entrepreneurship by scrutinizing the processes through which nascent organizations create social innovation—new practices that create social value to beneficiaries. More specifically, our study examines the role that shared values play in a nascent social organization’s efforts to conceive, develop, and deliver social value. Our inductive analysis highlights how the purported social value emerged from organizational leadership’s initial vision that committed the organization to provide specific value to beneficiaries that motivated the development of related organizational practices. Initially, members of the organization formed negative value judgments, as they perceived the practices and outcomes to be misaligned with members’ salient values. Members’ judgments concerning social and private value shifted despite organizational practices remaining largely unchanged, as their salient shared values shifted from other-directed caring to reciprocal communality and personal archievement. Our study contributes by theorizing social value and elaborating how shared values amongst organizational members influence how social organizations develop."
2020,"Boundary work and contextual demands: Micro-strategies in interprofessional collaboration -- Research on boundary work in the context of professions has studied how professional groups and their members engage in actions to expand or defend their profession’s jurisdiction. We argue that individual professionals not only engage in boundary work for reasons serving the professional group as a whole, but also in consequence of the very plain contextual demands of individuals that arise from their everyday work. Drawing on prior research on professionals’ boundary work and taking a micro-lens on interprofessional collaboration (IPC), we investigate the micro-strategies of individual professionals in IPC when faced with contextual demands that lead to conflicting subgoals. To do so, we build on fieldwork in German nursing homes, analyzing IPC between geriatric nurses (GNs) and general practitioners (GPs) that is strongly determined by differing contextual demands and subgoals. Our findings show a broad scope of micro-level strategies that GPs and GNs deploy when dealing with contextual demands at the boundary. Furthermore, we show how power and trust are core determinants of these micro-strategies, and develop a comprehensive theoretical framework on micro-level boundary work under conditions of contextual demands."
2020,"Beyond Vision Clarity: It Takes Trust to Listen to the Team -- At the heart of effective team communication there lies the clarity of team vision. It allows team members to listen with the expectation to move the team forward towards its goal. However, the mechanisms through which vision clarity translates into team listening are largely uncharted. In this study we developed a model that investigates the role of team trust and commitment in the relationship between team vision clarity and team action listening. Using the data collected from 474 members of 100 teams throughout a five-year quantitative study we show that the clarity of team vision is not enough in establishing effective team listening. It requires team members to have relational bonds such as trust to be receptive to the clarity of the team vision and demonstrate that they actually listen to what is being discussed in the team. We argue that this is because team listening extends beyond commonly researched practices of active listening, transcending the traditional verbal and non-verbal feedback. It relies on the actions taken as responses to team discussions that demonstrate to the team members that they are being listened. In trusting teams team members demonstrate that they listen to one another by taking action – team action listening."
2020,"From Shelter to Emancipation: How Disabled Workers Found Their Own Voice Through Identity Work -- While studies have examined individual and organizational identity work, we focus on the dynamic interplay between the two. Drawing on a six-year longitudinal study of disabled workers in a sheltered workshop in Germany, we show how the disabled found their own voice to be seen as active members of society and changed the organizational exclusionary identity of the workshop. We develop a process model with three different phases of “guided emancipation:” maintenance of identity constraints, external validation, and forging a new disability identity. Our findings advance our understanding of individual and organizational identity work processes in the workplace. First, engagement in purposeful identity work is not just performed by managers and leaders, but also by marginalized actors to empower themselves in an organization in which their role is highly constrained. Second, by illustrating the dynamic interplay between both individual and organizational identity work, we show how changes in individual identity work can precipitate an overall change in organizational identity. Third, we show how disabled workers engaged in identity work to change the socially constructed view of disability imposed on them by sheltered workshops as part of an institutionalized welfare system through expressing a positive disability identity based on their self-concept."
2020,"Negotiating Provisional Role Structures in the Shadow of Hierarchies -- Emergent coordination has been studied primarily in environments where generalized role structures and occupational communities are well-established. How individuals coordinate work in less-institutionalized or more rapidly-changing environments is less understood. I use a combination of participant observation and interview data collected in a medium-sized startup, GuestInn, to develop theory about the ways that people coordinate work when roles are more ambiguous. GuestInn management uses an institution, locally referred to as ""ownership,"" to foster commitment in employees. Lacking developed role relations, employees of GuestInn continually negotiate provisional role relations for coordinated work using the same institution, ""ownership."" The analysis contributes to our understanding of emergent coordination by showing how it works when role structures are less developed. It also refines our understanding of normative control to consider how it shapes employee-employee coordination. It also refine theory on the role of formal hierarchies in organizations with distributed authority rights: people's ability to negotiate lateral coordination without deep shared understanding of one another's work is facilitated by the shadow cast by vertical membership rights over negotiations, without directly involving nominal superordinates. Finally, I introduce the concept of generalized authority rights to describe authority rights that are decoupled from official position and nominally granted to all employees."
2020,"The Paradox of Network Intervention: Exploring the Consequences of Policies for Promoting Connection -- Social networks are everywhere, but until recently, the particularities of the structures were seldom remarked upon outside academia. Today, however, policymakers and managers are becoming more aware both of how networks are structured and how those structures create opportunities and constraints. Consequently, network interventions—deliberate efforts to shape a network configuration—are increasingly common. Nevertheless, researchers have devoted little systematic attention to them. We take a first step towards building systematic understanding of network interventions by examining the relationship between the structure of existing networks in targeted groups and responsiveness to network interventions. Specifically, we theorize that groups with greater fragmentation are less likely to engage with incentive-based network interventions and conditional on engaging, the interventions are less likely to be effective at transforming the network. To evaluate these ideas, we conducted a study of accountable care organizations. Our approach leveraged data on 100 million patient sharing relationships millions of providers in 3,000 communities across the United States. Additionally, we used several instruments to better identify the proposed relationships, including the Medicaid expansion and local political environments. Our results reveal a network intervention paradox—groups that may benefit most from such interventions appear least equipped to respond positively to them."
2020,"Going it alone or partnering? Collaboration, visibility and quality in the video game industry -- This paper proposes a role theoretic approach of inter-organizational collaboration in cultural industries. Complementing traditional resource-based arguments with identity considerations, we explore how the separation or consolidation of production and distribution roles affects the visibility and quality ratings of cultural products. We contend that roles primarily serve two functions in cultural industries. First, they grant access to resources. When roles are separated, each organization can access specialized resources and use them to target a different audience. Thus, products resulting from role separation are more visible than those launched by integrated creative producers or integrated distributors. Second, roles provide a basis for social categorization, and determine the criteria used by audience members to evaluate products. Role consolidation provides unambiguous evaluation cues, whereas role separation engenders ambiguous identity expectations. Thus, products resulting from role consolidation are characterized by higherratings. We test our hypotheses using a novel dataset of video games launched globally between 1980 and 2011. We complement these results with field interviews, drawing implications for the division of labor in cultural industries in the digital era."
2020,"Stand up or stand by: The effects of network positions on whistle-blowing -- This paper examines which network positions enable individuals to engage in whistle-blowing in a context of sexual harassment in Hollywood movie industry. We hypothesize that individuals who are in an open network are more likely to engage in whistle-blowing. This is because they can get access to variety of information regarding the level of retaliation by sexual harasser and supporters of their whistle-blowing. We also hypothesize that high-status individuals are more likely to engage in whistle-blowing. This is because they can control relevant resources such as information and connections. Also, they can ask low-status actors to support their whistle-blowing when they form a tie with low-status ones. We test our hypotheses on the Hollywood film industry and find support for our hypotheses that different network positions determine whistle-blowing."
2020,"An Agenda-Setting Model of Stakeholder Influence -- Existing research has shown that when multiple demands from stakeholder activists are directed at a firm in a sequential manner, the multiple demands build on each other to magnify activist pressure and thereby enhance activists’ capacity to influence firm outcomes. However, in many instances, multiple demands from stakeholder activists are not directed at a firm sequentially, but simultaneously. Yet, when multiple activist demands are directed at the same firm at the same time, these demands compete for attention from decision makers in the firm and risk crowding each other out, thereby hampering the ability of any individual activist demand to influence firm outcomes. Building on this premise, we propose an agenda setting model of stakeholder influence where multiple activist demands compete for space on the agenda of decision makers in firms. To test this model, we look at the shareholder proposal process in the United States and specifically examine the shareholder proposal campaign between 2006 and 2010 for the introduction of Say on Pay – a corporate governance policy that consists in submitting a firm’s executive compensation plan to a vote from shareholders. Consistent with the crowding out hypothesis, we find that Say on Pay proposals were more effective when firms received fewer shareholder proposals on other issues in the same year. And once adopted as part of the regular agenda of the annual meeting, Say on Pay was more effective at curbing CEO compensation when firms received fewer shareholder proposals on other issues in the same year."
2020,"What the WUNC? Perceptions of WUNC and Social Movement Mobilization -- Charles Tilly (1994) provided a four-part framework that outsiders (e.g., targets, potential supporters) use when assessing a social movement: worthiness, unity, numbers, and commitment (WUNC). These attributes have been embraced, sometimes implicitly, by most scholars of movement recruitment and mobilization. However, this measure has never been explicitly tested as an evaluative schema used by outsiders in making mobilization decisions. Here, we first develop a measure designed to assess the four factors of the WUNC theory (N = 539). We then use this measure to test how individual variation in this evaluative schema predict actual social movement donation behavior (N = 361). Finally, we consider how movements make identity claims around (1) the issues they focus on and (2) the diversity of the movement's participants affect WUNC and subsequent mobilization attempts (N = 380)."
2020,"Two Experts Are Better Than One: Reaping the Rewards of Specialization Through Better Communication -- The successful management of firm knowledge ensures that useful consumer knowledge is communicated effectively to inform product design decisions. This study analyzes how the use of a common organizational language can enhance communication between a marketing analyst and a product engineer. The use of a common language is shown to increase the probability of knowledge transfer; however, its dependence on learning effort from both parties makes it beneficial only when the cost of learning is not too high and each party can capture an adequate share of the firm's value. Distortions arise when the engineer, initially uncertain about the demand for its own product design, must determine the mode of communication with the marketing analyst to obtain information on consumer preferences. If the engineer is given the power to choose whether to implement a common language system and how much equity to allocate to the marketing analyst, the common language will be both under-used and under-exploited when it is adopted. The deviation of the engineer's actions from the firm optimal decision has managerial implications for the role of intermediation to resolve communication issues between disparate parties within an organization."
2020,"From exception to exceptional: How gender and tenure impact sponsor effectiveness -- The important role that referrals play in the hiring process, particularly for those contending with negative stereotypes and biases, is well documented in the literature. However, how these negative stereotypes and biases impact the efficacy of individuals providing referrals (i.e., sponsors) is largely missing from prior work, overlooking the additional effects that characteristics of the sponsors can have on the candidate’s (i.e., sponsees) outcomes. We take a multi-methods approach and provide evidence for differences in male and female sponsors’ efficacy, such that greater tenure increases the effectiveness of female sponsors but not male sponsors. Study 1 uses archival data on the U.S. Supreme Court law clerkship hiring process and provides initial evidence that sponsor gender and tenure interact to influence the probability of the sponsee being selected for a top-tier position. Study 2 replicates and extends these findings in an experimental setting and provides evidence for a causal relationship between sponsor gender and sponsor effectiveness. This study shows greater tenure confers credibility to female sponsors and this, in turn, increases female sponsors’ effectiveness, but that great tenure does not influence male sponsors’ efficacy."
2020,"Managing the Identity-Size Paradox in Platforms: The Case of Platform Cooperatives -- Platform organizations operate between two different competition logics: winner-takes-all, which prioritizes platform size, and distinctiveness logic, which prioritizes platform identity as a strategic dimension. While the platform strategy literature has primarily focused on the former, outlining ways to quickly grow the network of users and complementors, it has largely ignored platform identity. A key challenge for platforms is, however, to manage tensions that arise when both size and identity constraints are present. To explore how strategic tensions between platform size and platform identity are manifested and what platforms do to address them, we employ a multi-case study of platform cooperatives – an organizational form that commences from a distinctiveness logic. We find that platform cooperatives deal with several size-identity tensions as they go through three core phases: (1) enacting identity as a vehicle for growth; (2) diluting identity to enable growth; (3) growth-enabled identity redefinition. Moving across these phases, we identify the underlying strategic activities that platforms use to navigate what we termed as the ‘identity-size paradox’. Overall, we contribute to the literature on multi-sided platforms, and particularly in regards to platform strategy, as well as to the broader platform economy literature. Keywords: platform strategy, new organizational forms, platform cooperatives, platform identity"
2020,"Everything must change so that everything can stay the same: open access in UK academic publishing -- In this paper, we explore the question of how incumbents can respond to disruptive, existential threats in a way that reinforces their privileged position within a field. We draw on the case of the transition towards open access in the field of academic publishing in the UK. The findings of this study reveal that in spite of the change - from academic production and distribution as ‘closed access’ to ‘open access’ - incumbents respond to the threat of disruption by using socio symbolic strategies. Strategies that incumbents utilized to first influence the institutional pressures they faced and secondly to implement open access practices of distribution in a way that enhanced rather than disrupted their ability to capture value. Therefore, the threat of disruption ends up being an opportunity for the incumbents. Our findings contribute to current theories on organizational theorizing. By identifying the strategies that incumbents used to manage the transition to open access by showing how incumbents not only can maintain their privileged position, but even reinforce it when confronting disruptive institutional pressures, we contribute to conversations of institutional maintenance. We also contribute to theories on technology and institutions: we find that technological discontinuities trigger institutional change as they open up a plethora of potential paths of institutional change which opens up a discursive power struggle amongst field participants in driving the path most aligned with their interests."
2020,"Does Investor Gender Matter? The Signaling Effect of Gender Homophily in Entrepreneurial Finance -- One proposed solution to closing the gender gap in venture capital is to encourage female investors to invest in female entrepreneurs. This paper explores how gender homophily affects the long-term success of male-founded and female-founded firms, defined as the continued ability to raise venture financing. Using longitudinal data on venture-backed firms in the United States and employing matching methods, we find that female-founded firms backed only by female investors are two times less likely to raise additional capital compared to those whose first-round investors include male venture capitalists. We find no equivalent effect for male-founded firms. We propose that when female entrepreneurs receive funding from female investors, the market interprets this as an expression of diversity activism, rather than as a signal of quality. We test this explanation in an experimental setting and show that a female-female investment relationship produces a competence discount for the female entrepreneur, leading to lower evaluations of quality for female, but not male founders."
2020,"Pride Without Prejudice:The Burden of Under-Recognition in Organizations -- Public recognition is a powerful strategic tool for motivating individuals. Yet because high status recognition derives its desirability from scarcity, public recognition inevitably invites social comparisons. Since status recognition commonly corresponds with performance and accompanies tangible rewards, it is challenging to isolate pure social comparison costs. Leveraging a natural experiment in a large multinational organization, I provide novel evidence that employees are distinctly sensitive to status recognition beyond any material, career, or reputation concerns. When denied status recognition, employees are much more likely to exit the organization, despite receiving higher monetary rewards as recompense for nominal under-recognition. This study demonstrates the serious risks of using status recognition as an employee performance motivator. The analysis has broad implications for the strategic decisions organizations face when trying to motivate employees through nonmonetary reward systems."
2020,"Permeability alongside ‘Sense of Community’ in Open Contemporary Work Organization—Coworking-Spaces -- Open, entrepreneurial, and collaboratively organized work forms are proliferating worldwide. A prominent form is coworking-spaces, run by specialized coworking-space providers or incumbent firms. Coworking-spaces host collocated work of individuals, often from diverse professional backgrounds. Initial empirical insights indicate that coworking-spaces portray a sense of community among users and independent professionals. Based on an inductive case study from four distinct coworking-spaces, we introduce permeability an organizational characteristic of open contemporary work in coworking-spaces. Insights from the case study further support to model three levels of permeability: spatial permeability, procedural permeability and relational permeability. We develop mechanisms of how permeability functions and identify outcomes on individual-level (job satisfaction, learning, work efficacy, and innoficacy) and organization-level outcomes (team and project, innovation, and venture performance)."
2020,"Need, merit, and script: how a social enterprise moulded defector entrepreneurship -- Where does a hybrid ideal for social entrepreneurship come from? Existing research’s prevalent focus on the dichotomy between social and commercial logics left unexamined the possibility that the institutional environment for social entrepreneurship may be more complex. There can be multiple logics making the social enterprise generate different types of social values, and there may be distinct logics related to different aspects of its commercial viability. Through 10-month ethnography of a South Korean social enterprise supporting North Korean defectors, we find that hybrid organizing can be embedded in multiple logics that go beyond the traditional social-commercial dichotomy (e.g., social welfare, commercial, entrepreneurship, and national integration logics), and furthermore, responding to different challenges at separate times, a social enterprise may practice varying configurations of multiple logics. By adopting the ‘logics-as-tools’ view, we suggest that each hybrid organizing involves a constant process of specifying, embodying, and recombining multiple logics that pragmatically constitutes a unique hybrid ideal customized for particular organizing contexts."
2020,"Making Sense of Catastrophic Accidents: A Theodicy-Based Framework -- Catastrophic accidents can considerably threaten organizational members’ identification with their organization, and consequently cause their psychological distress. However, no studies have examined the strategies that organizational members use to make sense of such accidents and restore their psychological wellbeing. This paper draws on Weber’s theodicy concept, which reconciles the conflict between sacred and profane, to examine how organizational members sensemaking strategies. We combine an interpretive analysis of accounts by NASA employees following three fatal organizational accidents with a goal of creating a generalizable sensemaking framework, illustrating the utility of Weber’s theodicy concept to our understanding of how organizational members make sense of accidents. Our analysis reveals extensive use of theodicy logics to explain these accidents."
2020,"Virtue Transfer: Shedding Core-Stigma in The Canadian Wild Fur Industry -- This paper contributes to the stigma management literature by examining the viability of stigma-challenge strategies in mature, harm-based industries – contexts characterized by intense public scrutiny and threats to the continued survival of the category. Drawing on a case study of the Canadian wild fur industry’s response to anti-fur activism and a possible ban on its products, we show how such intense core-stigmas may be managed via collective action. Based on our findings we develop the concept of virtue transfer to describe a stigma-challenge mechanism whereby a virtuous identity – the positive attributes of a sub-group – is effectively transferred onto an entire industry category, in order to counter core-stigma."
2020,"Unpacking the moral dimensions of crowd-based organizing -- New forms of crowd-based organizations (CBOs) are puzzling for organizational scholars. On one hand, they enable unbounded participation – any individual from the crowd can join – creating the conditions for generative interactions and ongoing change. On the other hand, for an organization to sustain itself, the contributions of multiple actors need to be steered toward a certain direction to tame change and achieve stability. Extant literature insights suggest that CBOs may influence and guide crowd behavior through architectural and governance mechanisms, such as rules of participation and structure of incentives. In this paper, we aim to unpack the moral dimensions of CBOs. We develop the argument that discursive resources, in particular, orders of worth, play a crucial role in soliciting and maintaining the commitment of the crowd. Empirically, we study two CBOs, Quirky and Kickstarter, which mobilized orders of worth to convince crowds to contribute to a greater good through their platforms. We found that through raising and materializing moral claims, CBOs solicited the commitment of the crowd and managed to scale their activities. Yet, despite the early success, the actions of an increasingly diverse crowd put a strain on the process of materialization. Hotly debated controversies reflected deep moral tensions that rendered the commitment of the crowd fragile. By unpacking these controversies and the responses of Quirky and Kickstarter to deal with them, this paper offers new insights into the moral dimensions of crowd-based organizational forms."
2020,"When do Predictions Become Performative? Evidence from Simulation Technologies in Urban Planning -- This paper details a set of mechanisms that led to a novel conception of a precursor to performativity. We do so by drawing on data conducted through a year-long ethnography of urban planning processes in two major metropolitan regions in the United States. The urban planners that we studied employed a computer-based simulation technology specifically designed to make predictions that would facilitate long-term regional plans based on theoretical models of land use and transportation. We theorize that people must believe that a prediction is real for it to enable a performative cycle. We follow this theorizing to show how people come to their beliefs about predictions. When people experience predictions through simulations as granular and immersive they treat them as real. Immersiveness and granularity are not inherent properties of simulation, but rather they are constructed as organizations make decisions about structuring and the behavior of actors inside them. ."
2020,"Shepherding Situational Authority: Dealing with the Paradox of Radical Delegation in Hierarchies -- Managers who wish to empower and delegate authority counter a governance paradox: how to foster proactive judgment and collaboration of employees but maintain adequate control and alignment? Prior literature primarily suggests dealing with the paradox by clearly formalizing the scope of delegated authority to shield employee motivation from managerial interferences and managers for overindulgences of employee discretion. However, the more radical delegation is attempted involving also organizational matters, the more unavoidable the overlap of formal and delegated authority becomes. Utilizing internal discussion forum logs and interviews, I explored the organizational dynamics of formal and delegated authority in three mid-sized software services companies that had principally abandoned traditional manager-subordinate structures for broad employee autonomy but where a handful of top managers remained. I discovered that the studied organizations presented a contrast to scholarship: Employees enjoyed from an a priori undelineated encouragement to drive their own and company matters. Instead of a formalized system, decentralized authority was balanced by cross-mediation of managerial interventions, and, respectively, social scrutiny of managerial involvement. These social practices centered around, what I denote as, an attempt to shepherd situational authority so that what makes sense for the whole and who decides would get to be evaluated situationally rather than based on fixed authority. My findings contribute by extending the current understanding of the radical delegation of authority in companies with formal authority asymmetries."
2020,"The Cyclic Organization of Festivals as Temporary Events: The Critical Role of Spatial Practices -- This paper explores how space and spatial practices are central to organizing complex nomadic festivals, particularly how they enable a small number of organizers to coordinate changing actor multiplicity and place-based temporality. We draw on insights from a longitudinal and inductive study of a moving food festival whereby a multiplicity of parties and growing membership transpired. Our analysis reveals that spatial and material practices of envisioning the overarching space, constructing idiosyncratic spaces, enacting distinctive spatial performances, and cultivating unique place-based experiences enable organizers to address core challenges associated with the diverse multiplicity of actors and the temporality of events. Building on the spatial turn in organization studies, we contribute new insights to the study of festivals, temporary organizing and collective meta-level identities."
2020,"The protracted socio-economic impact of perceived white-collar crime -- While the antecedents, consequences, and management of stigma have been well analyzed, it is less well understood how the double stigma of white collar crime and incarceration impacts upon individuals. We also know less about how individuals respond to such stigma in their attempts to manage the perceived devaluation, prejudice, and discrimination before, during and after their incarceration. Drawing on three waves of semi-structured interview and focus group data with 70 inmates at a federal prison in the United States (US) over a period of 16 months, this paper explores how white-collar inmates are impacted by and think about responding to challenges associated with their perceived stigmatization as incarcerated felons. The paper provides three theoretical insights. First, the perceived unintended consequences of stigma associated with incarceration exceed the intended benefits of incarceration. Second, we show six inter-related strategies that help incarcerated individuals to overcome the negative consequences of perceived stigma: i) rationalizing and educating, ii) selective engagement and disclosure, iii) borrowing credibility and networking, iv) demonstrating ability to contribute, v) reassuring soundness of character, and vi) morphing Identity. Third, we conceptually decouple legal illegitimacy, which is time-bound, from social illegitimacy, which is incessant and creates a vicious cycle of self-fulfilling prophecy. Practically, this leaves us to question whether existing approaches to criminal justice overly stigmatize white collar criminals and result in protracted negative socio-economic consequences."
2020,"Using Semantic Networks to Identify the Meanings of Leadership -- We develop a novel method that integrates techniques from machine learning with canonical concepts from network analysis in order to examine how the meaning of leadership has evolved over time. Using articles in Harvard Business Review from 1990 through 2019, we induce yearly semantic networks comprised of roles structurally equivalent to the role of leader. Such roles, from which leader derives meaning, vary in content from coach and colleague to commander and dictator. Yearly shifts in the structural equivalence of leader to clusters of thematically-linked roles reveals a decline in the degree to which leadership is associated with consultative activities and a corresponding rise in the extent to which a leader is understood to occupy a hierarchical position. Our analyses further reveal that the role of leader comes to eclipse the role of manager, measured through changes in pagerank centrality as well as betweenness centrality over the course of our panel. Implications for new research on leadership, culture, and networks are discussed."
2020,"Designing shared representations for open-ended needs -- While a vast literature examined problem-solving as part of decision making in organizations, little is known about how problems are formulated in the first place. Through an ethnographic study, in this paper, I investigate problem formulation by looking at how architects in an architectural practice handled the early phase of their clients’ projects. This phase required them to operate in an uncertain environment, in the presence of ambiguity and heterogeneity of interests and needs, and lack of clarity about constraints. My findings show that problem formulation was driven by two distinct interrelated sub-processes: expanding and contracting problem-space boundaries while simultaneously structuring participation within those boundaries. Through six different activities – canvassing, expanding cognitive frames, envisioning future self, pillaring, scaffolding alternative futures, and reframing – architects managed the process iteratively by continuously altering the problem space boundaries and structuring participation, thus allowing a shared representation of the problem to emerge. My findings challenge the way we think about problems and extend our understanding of problem-solving process beyond the prevalent problem-solution dichotomy. This study contributes to the growing literature that sees problems as catalysts for future value creation by offering empirical evidence and new theoretical insights on how problems are formulated."
2020,"Narrating Value: How Peripheral Functions Prove Their Worth to Organizations -- Dominant narratives of value within organizations have labeled a group of organizational functions as “staff,” “back-office,” or “peripheral.” A common thread uniting these functions is a focus on compliance. These peripheral compliance functions, commonly viewed as indirect contributors to value or even adversaries to value, often struggle with a lack of authority or an inability to transform authority into influence. In this paper, I utilize an ethnographic study of peripheral Environmental Health and Safety professionals to show how these professionals constructed and enacted their own narratives to push back against dominant narratives of value. First, these functions minimized the disruptions caused by compliance, reversing negative perceptions of these functions as overseers or regulatory police, promoting instead a client service relationship. Second, these functions moved beyond compliance to highlight the important issues underlying regulations. These issues directly connected to how the organization generated value. In this way, these peripheral professionals established themselves as collaborators in core work, showing that their work was part of core work, not peripheral to it. This narrative approach to displaying value addresses the issues driving the divide between peripheral and core functions, thereby providing a more general strategy and platform for peripheral functions to address the challenges they face in organizations. This approach also enables organizations to better recognize and capture the value offered by peripheral functions."
2020,"Wait before you learn -- How Organizational Structure shapes Learning Paths -- Hierarchical structures -- here understood as the intra-organizational arrangement of lines of authority, information flows and roles of organizational members -- have been traditionally assumed to inhibit organizational learning and impede an organization's adaptability. We revisit this assumption, which is based on the logic that hierarchies may hinder the accurate processing and delay the internal forwarding of performance feedback, thereby foregoing the opportunity to learn and quickly adapt behavior in a way that increases performance. We argue that this logic is incomplete. A delay in feedback forwarding may also influence the characteristics of the learning process, in particular the search paths and focus of exploratory activities. Employing a simulation model, we examine how organizations search and experiment with new solutions when performance feedback on past actions is delayed and ambiguous. Contrary to conventional wisdom, our analysis uncovers mechanisms of deeper exploration by which hierarchical structures may improve, rather than impede learning and performance improvements in the long run. Our model shows that hierarchies both influence the speed of interpreting and learning from performance feedback as well as the search paths taken to explore alternatives."
2020,"Creativity: the interplay of structural and individual characteristics -- In this study, I examine creativity (i.e. experts’ consensus over novelty of production) as the result of interplay between individual background and structural properties. More precisely, I try to investigate whether and how network positions interact with individual focus to determine creativity. The findings of the study will indicate, for example, whether a filmmaker who can broker ideas of other film professionals is most creative when focused on a specific genre (Western) or role (directing). I contend that while network position reveals (or constrains) opportunities for enhancing creativity, individuals have agency in choosing types and aspects of production that would enable them to recognize and make use of those opportunities. As such, this study departs from purely structural explanations of creativity which posit a deterministic view. The context of the study is the American film industry with a focus on feature film titles distributed in the 90s and early 2000s"
2015,"A Benchmark Theory of New CEOs' Initial Compensation  This study proposes a benchmark theory to explain new CEOs' initial compensation. We contend that in the absence of managerial power and actual performance records, firms and successor CEOs both tend to rely on compensation benchmarks----external benchmark derived from the prevailing CEO compensation level within firms' peer groups and internal benchmark based on stable compensation ratios within firms' internal labor markets- ---in compensation negotiations. We specify how external and internal benchmarks (especially their relative levels), firms and CEO candidates' different benchmarking tendencies, jointly affect succession and compensation outcomes. Evidence from Standard \& Poor's 1500 index companies shows that 1) CEO successors tend to have different preferences on external and internal benchmarks respectively concerning their different CEO origins; and 2) firms are constrained by both benchmarks but are still flexible in choosing either benchmark. Because of these different benchmarking tendencies, the choice of insider/ outsider CEOs and setting new CEOs' initial compensation are two inseparable processes. While internal succession is much more likely to occur, insider successors tend to have a compensation drop from the departing CEOs final year compensation. Although external succession is rare, outsider successors tend to receive pay jump over their predecessors'."
2015,"Relational Signalling and the Rise of CEO Compensation: 'It is About What the Money Says...' The continuous rise in CEO compensation over the past few decades has been attributed either to efficient labour market processes (efficient market theories) or to corporate governance failures leading to insufficient control of boards over CEOs (managerial power theories). We argue that both approaches are incomplete and fail to explain why executive compensation remained stable for almost forty years, before it suddenly started to increase in the early 1980s. We present an alternative framework that complements both approaches, relational signalling theory. It conceives the transactions between boards and CEOs as a gift exchange relationship and explains the consistent use of premiums on top of reservation wages as an inherent element of the exchange. We argue that the sudden and subsequently continuous rise of CEO compensation is due to a major change in the signalling environment caused by the requirement to publicly disclose perquisites, introduced by the SEC in 1977."
2015,"Smoke Signal or Smoke Screen? Why the Media do not Disapprove Equally of Overpaid CEOs This paper explains the amount of disapproval faced by firms that overpay their CEO by integrating signaling and categorization theories. We argue that, in contexts characterized by intense scrutiny, ambivalent signals sent by firms suspend categorization by stakeholders, leading to further disapproval, whereas ambiguous signals represent a form of category straddling that attenuates disapproval. We find empirical support for this proposition in the context of CEO overcompensation in the U.S. (1995-2007) after examining two organizational signals that affect perceptions of economic fairness (i.e. corporate philanthropy) and social fairness (i.e. employee diversity). Our integration of the signaling and categorization literatures adds to extant knowledge on firms social evaluations and recasts CEO compensation research within the literature on information intermediaries."
2015,"How do Institutions Shape CEO and Worker Compensation across Countries? A Configurational Study Understanding the determinants of executive compensation is a vital area of research on corporate governance and reward systems. This study contributes to our understanding of how key institutional differences across countries shape how top executives and rank-and- file employees are compensated. Using a configurational approach, I explore how country-level institutions combine to shape the compensation of CEOs and workers across countries. Building on an interpretation of the studys findings, I discuss implications for research on cross-national differences in executive compensation."
2015,"Fitting In or Standing Out? The Tradeoffs of Structural and Cultural Embeddedness A recurring theme in sociological research is the tradeoff between fitting in to and standing out from a social group such as a formal organization. Recent work examining this tension has privileged network structural accounts over cultural explanations. We remedy this imbalance by developing a theory of how structural and cultural embeddedness jointly relate to individual attainment. Given that organizational culture is hard to observe, we develop a novel approach to assessing an individuals cultural fit with an organization based on the language expressed in internal email communications. Drawing on a unique data set that includes the complete corpus of 10.25 million email messages exchanged over five years among 601 employees in a high-technology firm, we find that network constraint impedes, while cultural fit promotes, individual attainment. We also find evidence of a tradeoff between the two forms of embeddedness: cultural fit benefits individuals with low network constraint (i.e., brokers) but hurts those who are highly constrained."
2015,"On Core-Periphery Effects of Formal Structure and Informal Networks on Employees Innovativeness. Despite the fact that multiple studies have investigated how informal intra-organizational affect employees creative outcomes, the impact of employees simultaneous positions in both informal and formal organizational structure on their ability to implement ideas into developed innovation has been overlooked. After analyzing primary data from an R&D; unit of a large multinational innovation-driven company composed by 276 R&D; scientists and engineers, we find that employees who stand at the core of the informal network and simultaneously belong to a core organizational unit have greater innovative performances. However, this effect is negatively moderated by their distribution of ties across the core and the periphery of the informal network."
2015,"Knowledge Transfer in Multilevel Networks: Contingent Effect of Organizational and Social Structure We examine how organizational and social structure jointly influence knowledge transfer and sharing relations across the boundaries of organizational subunits. We specify and estimate models that emphasize the role of multilevel network mechanisms in sustaining knowledge sharing relations within organizations. We test hypotheses about the contingent effect of formal organizational structure on the propensity of members of a Formula One racing team to share knowledge across the boundaries of their subunits. Results show that under conditions of lower task complexity knowledge is unlikely to cross the boundaries of organizational subunits. However, as task complexity increases the boundaries of organizational subunits become more permeable to crosscutting network ties. More specifically, as task complexity increases we find that advice relations are more likely to connect organizational members across the boundaries of interdependent subunits. We show that these multilevel mechanisms create network dependencies among organizational members that reinforce, complement and complete the workflow dependencies defined at the level of organizational subunits."
2015,"The Team And Its Leader: Multilevel Effects Of Network Embeddedness On Performance The literature on team performance has largely ignored the embeddedness of a team in a larger network of peers over time. In this paper, we argue that team performance can be explained by the network position of the team leader, but also by the aggregate network position of other team members. Furthermore, we propose that the team leaders influence on team performance is moderated by the embeddedness of the team in a larger collaboration network. To test our hypotheses, we study the network of French movie teams (comprising directors, producers, art directors, editors, and cinematographers) between 1996 and 2010. We find that the network position of the team leader  the movie director  has a U-shaped effect on team performance. Specifically, directors with either very cohesive or very sparse collaboration networks contribute most to team performance. Surprisingly, the effect is the opposite for teams. Teams embedded in collaboration networks that are neither very cohesive nor sparse have a positive effect on team performance. Finally, we find that the benefits of a network position of the team leader and the team reinforce each other. We conclude with implications for scholars and practitioners."
2015,"Responding to Identity and Reputation Dissonance in a Management Consulting Firm It is well established that organizational identity contributes to corporate reputation because organizations enact what they believe they are. In this paper we argue that identity can also lead to reputational claims that are unsustainable and we consider how this tension is addressed. In a study of a large management consulting firm, we find that its identity is idealized by selective interpretation of the organizations origins and legacy. Idealization focuses on what the organization wishes to be known for but also risks reputational dissonance when knowledgeable clients treat these claims skeptically because they are inconsistent with their perceptions and experiences. Dissonance is managed but not necessarily resolved by remediation mechanisms that focus on work winning and execution. These mechanisms are: first, what we term changing levels to a focus on partners and their teams; second, efforts to display a shifting identity such as through altruistic behavior; third, emphasizing value through over-performance and offering extra value in the process of pitching for and conducting client work. Together, these mechanisms create common ground between different parties and also buttress organizational identity, permitting the firm to sustain its reputational claims, notwithstanding unresolved challenges to them."
2015,"Does Who We Are Influence What We Say? Organizational Identity and Responses to Negative Events This paper explores the influence of organizational identity on firms willingness to share information regarding negative events  in this case financial restatements. It is predicted that organizational identity orientation and the extent to which social responsibility is included in the content of an organizations identity will influence information provision following a restatement. Results show a positive correlation between the magnitude of the restatement and the informativeness of the restatement announcement and provide evidence of a positive relationship between a relational/collectivistic OIO and the informativeness the announcement. Results also show a significant negative interaction between a relational/collectivistic OIO and the magnitude of the restatement in predicting the amount of information provided. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that organizational characteristics can influence responses to negative events."
2015,"Organizational Identity and Resistance to Environmental Pressures A key problem faced by organizational decision makers is uncertainty regarding the relative value of alternative courses of organizational action. Two largely isolated streams of research in organization theory have emphasized different mechanisms for dealing with such uncertainty. Research in institutional theory indicates that uncertainty leads organizations to imitate others in their field. The literature on identity theory suggests that actors group membership (i.e., organizational identity) strongly informs how they behave in the presence of uncertainty. This paper aims to synthesize these two theories by showing how organizational identity affects the degree to which organizational decision makers imitate others in their field. Three experiments not only test the relationship between organizational identity and resistance to environmental pressures but also examine status and identity type as potential contingencies. The results support the hypothesized positive link between organizational identity and resistance that becomes especially strong when status is high (rather than low) and when the organizational identity is normative (rather than utilitarian)."
2015,"Networks as Self-Defense: Identity and Compensatory Network Activation  We argue that social networks function as more than pipes and prisms that transmit tangible and intangible resources interpersonally: they also serve peoples intrapersonal goals of identity maintenance. Three experiments considered how identity primes affected peoples representations of their networks. People who received feedback that disconfirmed their gender (Study 1) and political/ideological (Study 2) identities, subsequently recalled, or cognitively activated, networks that were smaller, denser, more emotionally supportive, more likely to be composed of people they have known for longer, and more likely to be composed of people associated with their disconfirmed identity. While identity-disconfirming information unsurprisingly triggered negative affect, people who then cognitively activated the types of networks mentioned above reported elevated moods. These results are indicative of an affirmational, compensatory function of (cognitive) social networks that allows people a psychological respite from situations that disaffirm self-perception. A final study (Study 3) investigated how this psychological process could affect more instrumental networking goals such as information search. By utilizing networks to serve identity-related goals, people may distort and block the network pipes that service effective network mobilization."
2015,"Explaining Unequal Returns to Social Capital among Entrepreneurs In this paper, I challenge the dominant claim that women generate less value from using social ties because they tend to be embedded in less resource-rich networks. Although lacking access to valuable others constrains actors' ability to exploit network resources, it is unclear whether men and women embedded within the same networks would generate equal benefits. This study leverages a unique opportunity to compare men and women with access to the same social capital to address this question. I study business referral networks to examine how referrals, or connections to potential new clients, are exchanged among entrepreneurs. I find a gender difference in the referrals men and women receive from using social ties exists under conditions where a resource-holder anticipates preferences of a third-party contact. Simply stated, men and women are equally likely to receive business directly from their network contacts, however women receive far fewer connections to the clients, family, and friends of their network contacts, or third-party referrals. I further find that women in male-dominated occupations receive the greatest penalty. This study suggests a new network mechanism explaining gender inequality--anticipatory third-party bias--where expectations that a client, friend, or family member has a preference for men over women leads actors to disproportionately exchange resources with male network contacts."
2015,"Minority Producers and Pricing in the Champagne industry: The Case of Female Grape Growers We examine how minority-majority group dynamics among producers affect prices in the market for Champagne grapes. Using proprietary transaction-level data, we find that female grape growers who are minority members in the growers communityare able to extract systematically higher prices from buyers than their male colleagues. We argue that the underlying mechanism for this surprising pattern of results pertains to the relations maintained by minority members. More specifically, in-depth fieldwork shows that female growers get together to compensate for their isolation from the majority; as a result they develop their own price-setting norms, which are at odds with the majoritys. Free from abiding by male growers traditional market norms, they are able to share private information that allows them to extract higher prices. We discuss the implications of these findings for the study of how relationships shape price-setting processes, as well as for our understanding of inequality in markets. "
2015,"Gender and the Language of Crowdfunding In this study, we set out to examine the role of language in the success of online fundraisinga new form of entrepreneurial project financing. In particular, we evaluate the influence of linguistic content on fundraising outcomes, above and beyond type of product or service offered. Online fundraising settings pose an interesting empirical puzzle: women are systematically more successful than men, an outcome contrary to offline gender inequality. We propose that this outcome is partially explained by linguistic differences between men and women in terms of language they use, and we test this mechanism using data from the online crowdfunding platform Indiegogo. The results support our theory, suggesting a link between micro-level linguistic choices and macro level outcomes: the institution of crowdfunding may reduce gender inequalities in the fundraising arena by benefitting the communication style of women."
2015,"The Gender Gap Reversed: Gender, Risk Aversion, and CEO Severance Pay Contracts We investigate the gender pay gap in CEO severance pay contracts. Although female executives tend to earn lower compensation than male executives, we find that female CEOs are more likely to have a severance pay contract and receive more contractual severance pay than male CEOs. Further, we find that these gender differences in severance pay contracts are significant only for termination events considered risky from the CEOs perspective. These differences are consistent with the notion that female executives are more risk averse than male executives, and thus get more contractual income protection, suggesting that compensation contracts are designed and negotiated to offset gender differences in risk aversion."
2015,"A Contingency Theory of Collective Action Frames and Field Change Research has highlighted the key role of challenger actors and collective action frames in inducing changes in institutional fields. Less attention has been devoted to the field-level conditions under which different collective action frames can work. In this paper, I develop a contingency theory of collective action frames and field change, arguing that the same collective action frame can mobilize different levels of support, and induce different types of field changes, depending on the field structure in which challengers operate. I identify two ideal-types of collective action frames that challengers use to mobilize support around issues in a field (adversarial vs collaborative issue frames). I contend that the extent to which these frames are likely to mobilize support varies depending on whether challengers operate in a centralized or decentralized field. Adversarial issue frames are more likely to mobilize support in centralized fields, whereas collaborative issue frames are more likely to mobilize support in decentralized fields. In addition, when they mobilize a level of support sufficient to induce changes in a field, adversarial issue frames are likely to induce more radical field changes in centralized fields, whereas collaborative issue frames are likely to induce more radical field changes in decentralized fields."
2015,"A Theory Paper on Converging Fields: Insights from Institutional Theory Current research on institutional change is typically conducted with the field as the central unit of study. Studies on institutional entrepreneurship have been conducted in both mature and emerging fields, and there are calls for researchers to further explore the differences between institutional entrepreneurship in these two contexts. I suggest that a third category could be usefully examined: merging fields. In this paper I provide a comparison between merging fields, mature fields and emerging fields, and discuss the implications of this for institutional entrepreneurship. I suggest that this distinct context provides unique challenges and opportunities for institutional entrepreneurs."
2015,"The Interplay between Issue Arenas, Relational Structures, and Meaning Systems Scholars have studied organizational fields using three broad conceptual approaches- relational structures, meaning systems, and issue arenas- yet have tended to use the conceptualisations separately. Given that each conceptualisation offers a different perspective on the field  relational, cultural and political respectively  we argue that favouring one conceptualisation over another offers an incomplete understanding of the dynamics of field change processes. We examine the question of how issue arenas interact with field relational structures and meaning systems through a longitudinal qualitative case study of institutional change in the field of scientific research production in Australia. Our findings show how problem theorization and political action in the issue arena interplays with the fields meaning systems to enable new institutional logics to emerge and relational structures to shift. We offer a process model of how fields change when the issue arena is coherently aligned with the meaning system and enables peripheral actors to move to the centre of the field."
2015,"The Struggle for Dominance in Hollywood: A Strategic Action Field Perspective This paper applies the strategic action field perspective (Fligstein, 2013; Fligstein and McAdam, 2012) in exploring the dynamics of competition in the American Film Industry. The paper specifically focuses on the period prior to the establishment of the major Hollywood studios as the dominant players in the 1930s, and explores their role as challengers against the incumbents led by the Industrys first cartel, the Motion Picture Patents Company (the Trust). I argue that the strategic action field perspective helps provide valuable insights into the dynamics of emergence, change, and stability in this field through its unique articulation of incumbents, challengers, and socially skilled actorsas well as these actors interactions with one another and adjacent fields."
2015,"Sustaining Multiple Logics in a Hybrid Organisation: The Case of an East London Street Market Our inductive case study of an unusual organisationan East London street market reveals practices and structures that can aid our understanding of how hybrid organisations balance multiple institutional logics. We find a dominant logic that selectively and instrumentally uses elements from secondary logics to pursue the foundational goals of the organisation. To ensure the pursuit of organisational goals, structures and practices facilitate the co- existence and co-ordination of the different logics in the organisation. Describing a novel practice of incubation we provide a new perspective on recruitment and socialisation practices of hybrids and how conflict is balanced. This is a case where the system works becauseand not despiteindividuals in the organisation are following their own goals."
2015,"Building and Preserving a Sustainable Hybrid: The Case of Combo, a Commercial Impact Investor We extend extant theory on hybridization through an ethnographic study of a pioneering impact-investment firm. Our findings suggest that hybrid organizations may follow an alternative route to hiring, other than either bringing in imprinted professionals or blank slates. By hiring professionals who are experienced in but not adamant about a constituent institutional logic, hybrid organizations may be able to circumvent the respective downsides of hiring either imprinted professionals or blank slates. Such an alternative hiring approach does come with drawbacks of its own. Hybrid organizations can attempt to address these through corresponding organizational socialization processes. Our empirical study highlights the role herein of psychological safety, humor and a specialized in- house consultancy and training department in the missing logic. We point to scope conditions that may guide the interpretation of our results."
2015,"Meet the Mediator: The Role of Accounting in the Enactment of Multiple Logics in Practice This paper explores how individual actors negotiate action under institutional complexity. We follow a change initiative which is conceptualised as reprioritising the multiple institutional logics within an organisation. We highlight the role of a performance appraisal process as the mediating instrument (Miller & OLeary, 2007) through which this reprioritisation is translated to the actors and trace how they act in response. Our narrative builds on a case study of the retail department stores, John Lewis: the UKs largest employee-owned partnership. The findings demonstrate how individual actors deal with institutional complexity and how this reprioritisation comes to be enacted in practice. We highlight how logics travel into new domains and how actors interpret and respond to this by measuring compatibilities through prioritisation against existing logics. Critically the performance appraisal process allows actors to negotiate their own prioritisation and thus highlights that logics are not incompatible themselves; actors negotiate incompatibilities between logics in practice. Finally, we empirically explore the role of accounting as a mediating instrument in providing the space where this negotiation can occur. Our exploration highlights how actors use logics strategically for enrolment before mediation occurs and subsequently how governance is effected through the performance appraisal process in its ability to mediate both between remote and local domains, and also between multiple institutional logics in one local domain."
2015,"The Role of Non-Reflexivity in Facilitating and Destabilizing Organizational Hybridity This article explores the role of intentionality in the hybridization of competing logics. In line with intentionality-centric models of institutional work, past studies have generally assumed that hybridization is dependent on reflexivity. Data from an inductive case study, which traces the evolution of a major annual project in a youth movement, suggests another result: hybridization was enabled by non-reflexivity. We argue that the absence of reflexivity can facilitate the work of institutional entrepreneurs by avoiding the stasis that reflexivity may at times induce by triggering resistance, detailed planning for risk mitigation, and extended organizational deliberations. We also identify a temporal constraint, noting that non-reflexivity may be unable to sustain the challenger logic over time. Investigation of the case study data is supported by proposed criteria for the detection and analysis of reflexivity. In our case study scenario, the norms prescribed by an external logic, in this case corporatism, are perceived by the agents as inert value-neutral axioms, immune to reflexive questioning. The case study also illustrates the possibility that a logic external to the organization may be institutionalized to the extent that it disables agential reflexivity, a scenario that suggests that non-reflexive agency may be more pervasive, more risk-laden and more worthy of scholarly attention than previously assumed."
2015,"When Mom-and-Pops Differ From Chains: How Perceptions of Moral Authenticity Offer Market Advantage The primary objective of this paper is to provide a firmer theoretical and empirical foundation for the idea that small organizations (and retailers in particular) may enjoy a morality-based competitive advantage. I build upon literature on moral authenticity where an audience pays attention to actors motivation in evaluation of their behavior. I develop the idea that the formality of organizational process generates beliefs about service or product providers authentic motives (or lack thereof), thereby giving rise to a higher moral standing to the small organizations. In particular, I argue that when organizational actions are morally ambiguous but there is no explicit violation of a moral norm, small organizations benefit from their high moral standing, which consequently becomes a competitive advantage in the market. I use the diamond retail industry as my empirical setting to develop and test these arguments. Using observations of retailers websites and field interviews, I investigate how organizations deal with the moral ambiguity with respect to conflict diamondsdiamonds that funds rebels in war zonesand what the underlying reasons are. The experiment shows that small organizations experience less demand to clarify their moral integrity."
2015,"Too Big to Ale: A Study of Organizational Authenticity in the Craft Beer Industry This paper investigates why audiences value organizational authenticity. One explanation is that audiences use authenticity as a signal of quality. In this view, an organizational authenticity affects how audiences perceive the quality of the organization's offerings. In an alternative model, audiences value organizational authenticity independently from quality or perceptions of quality. Using this lens, audiences value goods from authentic producers because of their symbolic value, or what they represent. I empirically test each of these mechanisms in the craft beer industry. First, I exploit exogenous variation in consumer knowledge of a craft brewer's corporate ownership to demonstrate that authenticity has a causal effect on audience evaluations. Next, I provide further evidence that, controlling for actual product quality, audiences do not rate products from inauthentic craft brewers (those who sold to a large, corporate brewer) lower on quality dimensions like taste, aroma, appearance etc. However, audiences do discount the product's overall rating when they are aware of the brewer's inauthentic identity. The evidence suggests that audiences value authenticity as a symbolic good rather than a signal of quality."
2015,"Beyond Audience Expectations: Limits to Authenticity in the Franconian Microbrewery Industry In this study of more than 300 breweries in the northern part of Bavaria (Germany) during 1989-2012, we show that organizational decisions on product differentiation are highly influenced by expectations of audience members within regional markets as well as overlaps in the regional attraction of customers among competitors. A high quest for authenticity expressed by local audience members forces organizations to stick to authentic products, which in turn leads to greater similarity with competitors in the portfolio of offerings. On the other hand, large overlaps in the spatial location of customers - that indicate strong competitive pressures- reduce the similarity in product offerings. Also in situations in which a high quest for authenticity and strong competitive forces are present at the same time organizations reduce the similarity in product offerings. However, they do so exclusively by increasing their dissimilarity in non-authentic products. Similarity in authentic offerings gets even increased when high quest for authenticity and strong competitive forces co-exist. In light of these results we discuss possible implications for the study of organizational authenticity and legitimacy discounts."
2015,"The Role of Regional Identity in the Construction of New Regional Markets In a globalized era, firms compete on price and quality with competitors located elsewhere in the World and that benefit from locational advantages. Ventures that appear in regions without a history of such production are often initially uncompetitive on price or quality. I investigate the role of regional identity in the construction of new market categories. I argue that regional identity can shelter local firms from foreign competition, enabling firms that were initially uncompetitive to improve their offerings. I show that regional identity shapes the concept of local and channels audience attention to firms located within the geographic space delimited by the identity. Novel organizational forms appearing within such regions benefit from heightened attention. Furthermore, firms that appear consistent with the regional identity may activate the patriotic support of their regional communities. This research is based on a quantitative analysis of the discourse about the nascent market for Quebec wines in Montreal, the largest city in the Canadian province of Quebec. English speaking Montrealers generally adhere to the Canadian identity and French speaking Montrealers generally adhere to the Quebec identity. I study the impact regional identity had on the attention devoted to the nascent Quebec artisanal wine market category."
2015,"The Performativity of Agency Theory and the Emergence of New Business Practices in Finland While past research has shown the link between theoretical models and corresponding activities in business practice, further research is warranted on the conditions of performativity, the role and capabilities of actors, and the institutional context shaping the process. To remedy this gap, we present a historical case study on the emergence of agency theory related management practices and corporate-structural forms in Finland during the 1980s. The deregulation of financial markets and the increased centrality of stock markets in economy enabled the emergence of new practices materializing the core ideas of agency theory. While the study supports the performativity thesis on theoretical models materializing in social practices, it underlines that the process may be more diverse than has yet been recognized. On the one hand, this is because performativity requires not only new kinds of practices, but also new kinds of actors to first adopt these practices. On the other, the speed of the performativity process may be connected to the leeway that individual actors have in their societal context to adopt new practices."
2015,"Advancing the Performativity Debate: A Model of Technology-led Social Change The performativity thesis has been the focus of a vibrant debate in organization theory. Performativity extended to economic sociology the material turn already under way in other social sciences, but has been criticized for excessive constructivism and its neglect of the broader political and institutional processes driving social change. In this paper we advance the debate with an in-depth qualitative study of the attempt of a large financial data company to trigger change via a novel market technology. The company shifted its change strategy afte the technology failed to difusse as initially expected. Based on this, we develop a new model of technology- led social change that integrates performative and institutional views, suggesting a novel structural position, target and approach for the change agent seeking to perform a theory."
2015,"Emergence of Practice for Exchange This study explores how a new practice for exchange emerges. While exchange is a foundational element of economic activity, and much researched in several traditions and disciplines, previous research provides little understanding on how exchange is constituted in everyday micro-level interactions. This is despite that economic exchange refers to concrete activities in the context of markets, or other systems of exchange. Further, previous research on practices, more broadly, concentrates on established practices, and thus provides scarce understanding on their emergence. By drawing on a four-year ethnography of the emergence of exchange in the context of food collectives, we address these two major gaps in the literature and make several contributions to understanding the emergence of exchange as a practice. By conceptualizing exchange as practice, we develop a perspective to better understand both the nature of exchange and the emergence of practices. Additionally, our findings have several implications for understanding some core dynamics of market emergence."
2015,"Modularity In Use: Exploring The Process of Decomposing Digital Artifacts Modularity of socio-technical assemblages is a central theme in organization and technology dynamics. Modularity has been mainly discussed in the context of design and production of products and technological elements. Little systematic attention has been made to the dynamics through which modularity emerges during the use. We seek to understand modularity-in-use dynamics by integrating the design and practice views. We explore how modularity is (re)constructed by change agents during the replacement of an established modular artifact with a new alternative modular artifact. Relying on assemblage theory, we show that the designed modularity is pushed to the background when the artifacts are terrirtorialized as wholes against each other. When the attentions shift from the whole to the parts, the modularity of the old and new assemblages is enacted by decomposing the assemblages and recomposing them. However, the modular assemblages are not necessarily decomposed from built-in interfaces; rather built-in interfaces might be leveraged even as points of attachments rather than points of detachments. This, in turns, requires that organizations introduce and sustain inconsistencies in their working assemblages and tolerate the inconsistencies day-to-day practices. The modularity in use perspective enables us to capture dynamics such as unification of modular systems, decomposing modular systems, deviating from built-in interfaces, and tolerating architectural inconsistencies that emerge through the interaction between practices on the one hand and the modularity of the assemblages on the other."
2015,"The CEO-TMT Interface in Upper Echelons Research: A Review, Synthesis and Research Agenda The chief executive officer and top management team (CEO-TMT) interface, defined as the linkage and interaction between the CEO and other top managers, has gained increasing attention over the last years. Scholars have recognized that research on the distinct yet interdependent roles of the CEO and the TMT can help resolve shortcomings and debates in the upper echelons literature. Despite the burgeoning interest in this area, extant CEO-TMT research is characterized by considerable diversity in terms of levels of analysis, focal constructs and relationships, and therefore, its collective contribution to the development of the upper echelons perspective remains unclear. To fill this gap, this paper reviews prior work on the CEO-TMT interface, identifies dominant relationships, and synthesizes extant knowledge in an overarching framework. The review serves not only to catalog the current state of the art; it also provides directions on how different types of CEO-TMT research can help answer open questions in the upper echelons literature and enhance the explanatory power of the upper echelons perspective."
2015,"CEO-TMT Interplay in a Dynamic Environment: Implications for Firm Performance This study employs the upper-echelons theory to examine the performance implications of the intricate dynamics between CEOs and their subordinate TMTs. Research results based on a sample collected from firms in Vietnam show that CEO transformational leadership exerts a positive effect on TMT trust climate while environmental dynamism mitigates the effect. TMT trust climate also plays a prominent mediating role in converting CEO transformational leadership into better performance. Moreover, moderated-mediation analyses show that the mediating role of TMT trust climate is more significant in less dynamic environments. The research contributes to the upper-echelons theory by building an integrated model of CEO-TMT interplay within the broad context of CEO leadership, organizational environment, TMT process, and firm performance. It reveals the significance of the CEO- TMT interface that is required for enhancing firm performance under uncertain environments."
2015,"CEO Functional Background, Organizational Structure and Performance I develop and test a theory of how and to what extent bounded rational CEOs influence organizational performance through their impact on organizational structure. I examine the relationship between the CEOs functional backgrounds and the changes in reporting structure across multiple levels and segments of the administrative hierarchy. I find that CEOs increase the number of direct reports in their area of expertise and delegate to those not in their area of expertise. Subsequently, the CEOs' first-layer design choices cascade down through the hierarchy. I also find that these choices are associated with impacts on different domain-specific measures of organizational performance. My theory and results contribute to the strategy literature by fully articulating the mechanisms linking CEO attributes, organizational structure and performance. More importantly, I provide a novel perspective on organization design by demonstrating how local micro- structural design choices at the top of the organizational hierarchy are aggregated into the macro-structure of organizations."
2015,"New CEOs and Strategic Change: The Influence of Prior Board Experience The study explores the effect of new CEOs prior board experience on strategic change. We develop a theory to explain how prior board experience may affect new CEOs propensity and ability to initiate strategic change. Specifically, we suggest that prior experience on the focal board will inhibit strategic change, while prior experience on the boards of other firms will facilitate strategic change. We also predict that prior board experience with strategic change at other firms will have a positive impact on strategic change at the focal firm. Using data from a sample of the S&P500; firms from 2003 to 2013, we find that support for our theoretical predictions. Our study contributes to the literatures on strategic change, upper echelons theory, and CEO succession."
2015,"The Dark Side of Brokerage: Conflicts Between Individual and Collective Pursuits of Innovation Many studies have shown that brokers---actors who have disconnected contacts---have better performance. Far less is known about the implications of brokerage for those other than the person in the broker role. The absence of research in this area is surprising because by definition brokerage involves the broker and two other people. Do these other individuals benefit from their mediated connection? If they do, then how do their returns compare to the broker's? I address these questions with data on the intraorganizational networks of over 18,000 inventors at 37 pharmaceutical firms. To help disentangle causality, I use a novel estimation technique based on propensity score weighting that is unbiased if the specification is correct for either the exposure or outcome equations. Furthermore, in tests of the effects of having a connection to a broker, I focus on changes among existing contacts, where the decision to connect is exogenous because it was made prior to when the contact became a broker. Consistent with the idea of negative spillovers to brokerage, I find that becoming a broker has a positive effect on performance but the opposite is true for having a connection to one."
2015,"Divide and Conquer: Brokerage Dynamics and Dependence Asymmetry Despite the advantages of occupying brokerage positions in a collaboration network, such positions are considered to be ephemeral and unstable. Drawing on resource-dependence theory, I argue that the maintenance of a brokerage position is enhanced by the dependence asymmetry between the broker and the brokered alters. I test this idea on collaboration networks of creative artists in writing new and original songs for the Korean popular music (K-pop) industry where those who perform multiple roles (i.e., multirole actors) possess more resources to share with others. Using the discrete-time hazard analysis on the hazard of bridge maintenance and of network closure, I find that brokerage positions occupied by multirole actors are more likely to be maintained, especially when brokered alters are single-role actors. In additional analyses, I find further support that the power-dependence asymmetry between the broker and brokered alters is responsible for the maintenance of brokerage positions."
2015,"It is How You Broker: Behavioral Orientation, Structural Holes and Individual Performance In this paper we set out to explore the mechanisms underpinning returns to specific network positions, by considering the role of individuals behavioral orientation toward brokerage. In particular, we focus on the importance of individuals brokerage behaviors in affecting the well-established relationship between individuals brokerage positions and performance. Using individuals tendency toward acting as Tertius Iungens or tertius gaudens, we show the moderating effects that each of these behavioral tendencies has on the relationship between individuals brokerage position and their performance. We theorize and find evidence for the importance of consistency between motives/behaviors and network positions. In particular we observe that while having a tertius gaudens behavioral orientation increases the benefits of occupying a brokerage position, having a Tertius Iungens behavioral orientation decreases it."
2015,"Network Brokerage and Individual Creativity: The Contingency of Tie Strength and Time This study examines the effects of brokerage on individual creativity and the moderation of tie strength and time on brokerage effects in advice and friendship networks. We tested the hypotheses using a sample of R&D; employees in two firms in China. The results suggests that brokerage in advice network has positive effect on individual creativity. The effect is strengthened by tie strength but weakens over time. Brokerage in friendship network has a negative influence on individual creativity but this effect can decrease and turn positive with strong ties over time. In general, the results suggest that positive returns of brokerage in advice networks are short-lived. Brokers in friendship networks, while gaining no short- term benefits, can realize long-term gains through fostering strong ties over time."
2015,"A Multiple Social Comparisons Analysis of Performance Feedback and Pay Dispersion on Diversification Firm performance can be assessed relative to prior historical or social performance. However, social performance feedback has been theoretically underdeveloped among these two measures. Building on the behavioral theory of the firm and social comparison theory this study addresses the literature gap by advancing the theoretical development of two types of social comparisons related to performance across firms and pay dispersion across top management team members and their effects on corporate diversification. We argue that firms undertake more diversification when social performance feedback is negative and less diversification when it is positive. We also propose that social performance feedback acts jointly with dispersed TMT unexercisable options, restricted stock, and exercisable options to influence diversification level. Empirical results based on a panel dataset of 235 large public manufacturing firms from 1994 to 2006 provide considerable support for our hypotheses."
2015,"A Contingent Perspective and Multidimensional Conceptualization of Problemistic Search Problemistic search plays a central role in organization theory. It is generally described as a problem-directed, simple-minded and biased activity, closely intertwined with organizational choice and change. In this article, we reconceptualize problemistic search and its effects on organizational performance. We view problemistic search as the activity that decision makers perform in a cognitively constructed and limited space to identify alternatives to the current behavior in response to poor performance and we introduce scale, scope and exhaustiveness as its main attributes, in which bounded rationality is primarily manifested. What is more, we advance current understanding of problemistic search and its consequences by integrating two important contingencies, namely performance history and social context, that influence the way organizations impose constraints on their search for alternatives and determine whether organizations are positioned to benefit or suffer from their problemistic search."
2015,"Effects of Unexpected Financial Slack on Growth and Diversification: Evidence from China IPO SMEs Financial slack resources, a very core concept of organization theory, also concerned strategists owing to its undeniable impact on firms performance and prevalence in managerial practices. The behavioral theory of firms argues that managers are motivated to maximize control over discretionary resources through well-planned internal process and gradual accumulation. However, in a turbulent and competitive environment, the role of unexpected slack resources and the mechanisms through which they impact performance remain relatively unexplored. Hence, this study investigated the micro-mechanisms of the relationship between financial slack and firms growth performance with a dynamic lens. Specifically, using the phenomenon of IPO over-financed in China as the empirical context, we proposed and tested that, with unexpected capital resources raised through IPO, firms in a competitive environment did not engage in diversification until the slack resources are extraordinarily high (a curvilinear relationship). And, in such cases, SMEs preferred geographic diversification rather than industry diversification. Financial slack was also found positively correlated with firms growth performance both in the short term (one year) and in the long term (three year)."
2015,"Performance Feedback and Risk Taking: What Risk? This paper theorizes risk taking in response to performance feedback, using insights from decision-making theory to extend the behavioral theory of the firm (BTF). In particular, the paper separates risk from change and distinguishes between the risk of making errors of commission and that of making errors of omission. This distinction opens up new perspectives: firms respond to performance feedback depending on whether it is associated more with past errors of commission or errors of omission. They adjust their exposure to that type of error going forward (and, thereby, automatically adjust exposure to the other type of error too). So rather than affecting the level of risk, which has been central to BTF predictions, performance feedback affects the type of risk taken. The paper adds further nuance to this relationship: the adjustments of risk-type preference in either direction are of different frequency and magnitude. Furthermore, preference-type shifts affect decision alternatives with high perceived outcome variability differently than alternatives with low perceived variability. Together, the testable propositions in this paper can provide the foundation for a research agenda that focuses more on risk-taking behavior than risk taking per se. This agenda stands not only to inform the behavioral theory of the firm but also to illuminate wider dynamics of organizational adaptation and renewal."
2015,"Stigmatized in Infancy but not for Life: The Legitimation of the Travel Agency in Victorian England This study explores the puzzle of how new types of organization that are stigmatized in infancy can achieve legitimacy. Exploring the case of how Thomas Cooks travel agency moved from stigma to legitimacy in Victorian England, we propose a two-step process model of institutional normalization: The subtle integration of a new organizational form into the societal landscape. Our findings show that stigmatized types of organization need to first camouflage their stigma and chastise stigmatizers before building solidarity with these same stigmatizers. We discuss implications for legitimacy attainment, processes of de-stigmatization, and the negative side of legitimacy."
2015,"Institutional Hibernation and Revival: Resurgence of Private Entrepreneurship in Post-Mao China This study examines the revival of an institution after decades of delegitimation. We argue that the former legitimacy of the institution hibernates in constituent organizations that existed during the delegitimation period. We further argue that the hibernated legitimacy in constituent organizations does not automatically help revive the delegitimized institution. Instead, whether the hibernated legitimacy facilitates the institutional revival depends on the nature of the delegitimation and the strength of the relegitimation trigger. We test these arguments in the context of China, where state delegitimation of private entrepreneurship in the Mao era was well targeted at two types of social organizations (i) local industry and trade associations, and (ii) the family. We find that local prevalence of industry and trade associations before 1949 (the Communist era) had a negative effect on individuals entry into private entrepreneurship in the early reform era (19781988) but it prompted individuals to become entrepreneurs faster when the state strongly relegitimized private enterprise in 1988 and thereafter. In contrast, the family, as a less collective organization, proved to be a more fragile platform for hibernated legitimacy."
2015,"The Dream of Pharmaceutical Care: The Role of Emotion in Galvanizing the Rank and File We address the question of how a field level actor engages in institutional work to defend against demise in the context of U.S. pharmacy. The shift to mass manufacturing of medications which began during World War II rendered pharmacists skills of compounding almost obsolete and threatened the survival of the profession. While defensive institutional work has been conceptualized as maintaining an institution in face of threats, we argue that it can also involve elements of creation or modification of existing institutions. We examine such reconstructive work by focusing on the use of rhetoric as an analytic approach in the editorials of the Journal of the American Pharmaceutical Association. We contribute to the developing literature on institutions and affect by showing how emotions can be used strategically to reconstruct an institution as defense against demise."
2015,"Identity Driven Institutional Work Although a growing number of scholars suggest that the construction of identity is an important form of institutional work, the complex interactions between identities and institutions remain under-explored. In particular, few studies consider how the affective aspects of identities may inform institutional work. This article examines the experiences of lawyers who volunteered to create and support a legal charity. As these volunteers grew to more than twenty thousand over fifteen years, the charity gradually centralized charitable work across law firms for the first time. In this way, it transformed the institution of pro bono work within the English legal profession. Drawing on this case study, this article employs a grounded theory methodology to generate a conceptual framework that connects emotion work, identity work and institutional work. This framework suggests that some professionals work to re-assert and remember aspects of their traditional identities that compete with some contemporary demands. This can prompt identity contradictions that inspire reflection on professional practices. This identity work may also encourage professionals to evoke emotions of guilt that can imbue contradictions with enough significance to create a purpose for remedial institutional work. When enabled by meso-level processes, such micro-level work can reinvigorate traditional practices and accomplish institutional change."
2015,"The Nature and Limits of Collective Identity as an Editing Lens for Institutional Complexity Through a comparative case study of two Indian microfinance organizations embedded in two different institutional logics of microfinance we demonstrate how collective identity is important for explaining how and why strong institutional pressures are translated into practice differently by different organizations in complex institutional fields. We also suggest that which institutional pressures are translated depends on the degree to which pressures are editable in talk and practice, and on their perceived identity implications. Thus we contribute to the literature on institutional complexity by inductively arguing that collective identity and pressure editability are important moderators of the effect of strong uniform institutional pressures on organizational practice in complex fields."
2015,"Same Institutional Complexity, Yet Different Organizational Responses: A Study of U.S. Art Museums Despite the recent academic attention to institutional complexity and organizational responses, little is known about why organizations within the same institutional field perceive their complexity differently, and whether their organizational characteristics lead to different response options. I develop a theoretical framework to explain that organizations have different level of necessity to accommodate external constituencies, which then shapes different organizational responses. The framework suggests that organizations with middle- status, low resource autonomy, and a strong presence of a dominant stakeholder find higher level of necessity to conform to external constituencies. The empirical analysis utilizes a field of U.S. art museums where market and profession logics collide. Using data of over 780 exhibitions of 22 art museums from 2005 to 2012, I find that both the middle-status organizations and the organizations with low resource autonomy balance competing logics by focusing one logic in each activity (i.e., separation) rather than combining the two logics throughout their activities (i.e., combination). I also find that the organizations with a dominant stakeholder are more likely to gear toward their dominant stakeholders logic (i.e., deletion) instead of balancing the two logics in their institutional field when they have low resource-autonomy."
2015,"Faraway, So Close! Field Access and Status Rise in Case of Institutional Complexity This study addresses the issue of how different fields are navigated, and in the process changed, by actors subject to multiple status hierarchies. Criteria defining status hierarchies are constituted according to specific institutional logics, creating a situation of institutional complexity for entering firms. We show how high- status firms gain access in a new field characterized by different status criteria. Through multiple longitudinal case studies we investigated the failed and the successful attempts of the five Hollywood majors to co-produce and distribute Italian movies in face of relational discrimination. The latter was spurred by the majors carrying of a cinema as business logic threatening the incumbent public good logic. We find that new entrants leveraging different audiences (i.e., moviegoers, artistic talent and incumbent firms as potential partners) were those that succeeded in gaining the necessary resources and in progressively increasing their status. Market category conformity, combination and affirmation were used, in different stages, to address market audiences, while avoidance and, later, promotion of claims related to collective identities was used vis--vis the professional audiences participating in the institutional field."
2015,"From La Bohme to La Wally: How Status Affects the Unconventionality of Opera Repertoires In this paper, we examine how organizational status affects nonconformity in the Italian opera field where the tension between divergent institutional logics threatens the position of high status organizations while opening opportunities for upward status mobility. Data on 42 Italian opera houses repertoires from 2004 to 2011 show that middle status theaters are in the best position to increase the unconventionality of their artistic programs. This also holds true when the risk of delegitimation that stems from nonconformity is so high to compromise the external perception of opera houses identities: middle status theatres are more willing than their higher and lower status counterparts to raise the unconventionality of hybrid operas that blur the boundaries between established categorization systems and potentially dilute their identities. Differentiation opportunities and potential for status advancement are strong incentives for middle status theatres to embrace the high-risk path of unconventional hybridity. Keywords: status, nonconformity/unconventionality, category, identity, opera and arts."
2015,"To H-1B or Not to H-1B? Inequality and Social Closure in U.S. Immigrant Work Authorizations Scholars have long investigated the unequal employment outcomes of U.S. immigrants from less developed sending countries. This study examines government agents role in such processes. I analyze 60 months of agents H-1B work authorization decisions, which shape immigrants U.S. careers. Even without explicit evaluation criteria regarding origin country, initial employment denials are more likely for immigrants from less developed countries, controlling for education, salary, occupation, and other key characteristics. Second, by applying social closure theories, I find no sending country effects when agents evaluate requests to change job or employer (once legal standing, and thus group access has been granted)."
2015,"The Impact of Horizontal and Vertical Comparisons on Mobility Outcomes We distinguish between vertical and horizontal social comparisons to unpack the well-documented impact of wage dispersion on mobility outcomes. We propose that horizontal wage dispersion increases mobility rates by inducing negative social comparisons that trigger the perception of inequality and relative deprivation. By contrast, vertical wage dispersion increases mobility rates by inducing positive social comparisons that motivate employees to exert effort in hope for internal career advancement. We test our theory by assessing the impact of vertical and horizontal wage dispersion on employees exit from the firm. Using employer- employee matched data from Sweden between 2001 and 2008, we find that mobility rates decrease when vertical wage dispersion is high; conversely, mobility rates increase when horizontal wage dispersion is high. In addition, the impact of vertical and horizontal comparisons increases with workers social similarity and in organizations with more transparent wages. Moreover, consistent with the notion of envy and relative deprivation, we find that the impact of horizontal wage dispersion on mobility is amplified (mitigated) for bottom (top) wage earners in the hierarchical position. Finally, consistent with the pursuit of internal rewards, the impact of vertical wage dispersion on mobility is amplified (mitigated) for top (bottom) wage earners across organizational positions. More broadly, the study emphasizes the need to consider both vertical and horizontal social comparisons as an important source of mobility outcomes."
2015,"For Love or Money? Gender Differences in How One Approaches Getting a Job Extant supply-side theories conclude that women and men apply to or prefer different jobs but are unable to explain gender differences in applying to the same job. By comparison, demand-side theories explain both between and within job employer differences. We correct this by considering gendered approaches to the hiring process. We propose that applicants can focus on entering an exchange relationship by emphasizing either the relational or the transactional aspects of a job and that this affects whether they are hired. By relational, we mean that the job seeker focuses on developing a connection and fairness with their employer. By transactional, we mean taking a more aggressive stance and focusing on more quantitative aspects of the job. We expect women to be more relational and men to be more transactional during the hiring process. We examine behaviors in an online external labor market for graphic designers, Elance.com where we find that women are more likely to be hired than men by about 9.5%. Quantitative linguistic analysis on the unstructured text of job proposals reveals that women (men) adopt more relational (transactional) language in their applications. These different approaches affect a job seekers likelihood of being hired and attenuate the gender gap we identified. Attenuation suggests that how one approaches the hiring process matters but that it isnt gender per se that affects being hired, but rather its correlation with a particular style of engagement."
2015,"Comobility We present the first population-level characterization of comobilitythe movement of multiple employees from one firm to another. Both in a seven-year snapshot of the entire Danish economy and several decades of employer-employee matched records from the worldwide automatic speech recognition industry, we find that 10-11% of interorganizational job moves occur jointly with co-workers. Co-movers enjoy higher productivity and an initial wage premium compared with those who move alone. These gains appear largely due to coproduction complementarities, especially among simultaneous co-movers, although information sharing (i.e., employee referrals and scouting out new opportunities) helps to explain sequential comobility."
2015,"Self- and Peer-Narratives in the Ongoing Construction of a New Actor Category This research examines the ongoing narrative construction of a new actor category. It introduces peer-narratives as the narratives that other members of a new category produce about a peer, which complements that of self-narratives, i.e. narratives that category members make about themselves. It investigates in-depth the case of the new actor category of tech blogging by analyzing self- and peer-narratives associated with 103 transition episodes that affected tech bloggers during a seven-year period. This research extends and challenges existing thinking on categories in its conceptualization of how self- and peer- narratives do not only reflect but also participate in the ongoing construction of a new category. It reveals how actors go over time through various events they make sense of narratively individually and collectively and how such self- and peer-narratives shape the construction of the actor category. It adds to category research by identifying and theorizing four types of stories related to two key tensions in the ongoing construction of a new actor category: the tension between establishing the new category and questioning it, and the tension between retrenching in the new category and permeating other categories. Finally, this research highlights how category prototypes may only emerge retrospectively, as they become contested and renegotiated narratively."
2015,"The Valuation of Market Talk and the Limits or License of Labels Research on market categorization has emphasized the constraints labels impose on producers and products. In this paper, I investigate how labels restrict or expand the scope of claims producers can credibly command in market talk public accounts of activities or intentions. I study Prosper.com, a crowdfunding website that facilitates lending among strangers over the internet. Through machine learning, I assess the category memberships suggested by prospective borrowers text descriptions of why they need money, and then I construct a continuous measure of descriptions categorical coherence or complexity. Then, exploiting the introduction of a new labeling requirement, I assess the impact of labels on the valuation of market talk. I find that in the presence of labels, the respective benefits and hazards of focused and diffuse claims are attenuated."
2015,"Can A Girls Best Friend Be Born In A Lab?: The Role of Ritual in the Diamond Market A number of studies suggest that people may care about the process by which a product is made, even when it is not associated with the quality of the product. A common example of this preference is production-process conservatism, whereby consumers prefer products made via traditional practices rather than those made via new practices. However, it is not clear what mechanism drives such conservatism and it is difficult to rule out the possibility that it is due to differences in product quality. We argue that this resistance derives from the use of a product in the performance of a social ritual, where deviation from the traditional rules of the ritual carries the risk that one will signal a lack of commitment or cultural competence. We focus on the context of diamond jewelry market, where lab-created diamond that are identical to mined diamonds but are produced in a laboratory become available. In particular, we expect consumers to be more resistant to lab-created diamonds when they buy diamond jewelry for an engagement gift, compared to when they buy diamond jewelry for a more routine gift. Our hypothesis is tested in a series of online experiments. We conclude by discussing theoretical implications of these findings and the mechanism underlying ritual reinforcement for future research."
2015,"We Hate That Label! On Power and Resistance in Category Formation In this paper, we aim to advance theory on category formation by expanding its power-side. Drawing on labeling and social identity theories, we argue that category formation processes, - rather than peaceful cooperative interaction towards consensus - can be seen as potential places of battle where actors have conflicting motives, and use labelling attempts as power claims. We propose a framework for power analysis in category formation building on Bourdieus notion of symbolic power, and earlier studies of successful category establishment and change. We illustrate these thoughts in an empirical description of how PR consultancy and other labels were proposed, resisted and negotiated to denote a specific set of firms in Sweden during the period 1981-2009. Identifying important audiences, like media and policy makers, and analyzing their capacity to gain power over the labelling process, we seek to explain why consultants themselves failed to gain influence over category formation."
2015,"Bankers Rhetorical Legitimation Strategies During the Global Financial Crisis Widespread public condemnation of the behaviour of British banks following the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 has drawn attention to the individuals who led the major banks and their trustworthiness. In this paper we asked the question  how did the bankers justify their personal conduct and defend the legitimacy of their organizations? Drawing on data from Parliamentary hearings as part of a major investigation into the British banking crisis we analysed rhetorical legitimation strategies used by the bankers. We found that these strategies failed to acknowledge the context of the investigators, who were concerned with the socio-political legitimacy of bankers behaviour."
2015,"So Much Masturbation: A Study of Tropes in the Construction and Destruction of Meaning  Organisational crisis often provides an opportunity for actors to contest or appropriate taken-for-granted meanings. The study is situated in FPO, an Australian debt collection agency, throughout the beginnings of, duration, and subsequent stabilisation after the Global Financial Crisis. I explore how oppositional discourses draw on institutional logics to construct tropes  figurative speech, such as metaphor and sarcasm  that create problematisations and subject positions. Findings indicate that dissonance tropes are mostly used to create problematisations with discourses and resonance tropes are mostly used to restore institutional meaning. Actors stabilised the institutional narrative by re-storying organisational history. This study suggests that figurative language acts as a powerful resource in institutional work."
2015,"Maintaining the Legitimacy of Organizations in Times of Crisis: The Case of Familiarity This study investigates the frequency, the form, and the outcome of legitimacy judgments towards banks in times of economic crisis. We use the number of newspaper articles to measure the frequency of legitimacy judgments. In a more detailed computer-based analysis, we measure the form of the legitimacy judgment based on the type of newspaper article, and the legitimacy of the bank based on the sentiment of the article. As an important driver of legitimacy, we investigate the role of familiarity, measured by the proximity and comprehensibility of banks to the public before the crisis. We find that in times of crisis the frequency of legitimacy judgments increases, especially when a cognitive judgment form is applied. We also find that familiarity helps in maintaining legitimacy in times of economic crises. We provide empirical evidence for a change of the evaluators perspective in times of crisis, leading to a more thorough, in number and intensity, usage of cognitive judgment forms. Further, we empirically validate that perceived features of an organization, namely familiarity, determine cognitive legitimacy. Finally, we contribute to research about drivers and protectors of legitimacy, differentiating between times with and without crisis."
2015,"Banks VS. Credit Unions After the Financial Crisis We explore competition between U.S. banks and credit unions in the aftermath of the financial crisis that began in 2007. We propose that as public sentiment against banks turned sharply negative, some consumers found credit unions more appealing due to their emphasis on value creation for the community as opposed to profit maximization. We theorize that this shift led to an increase in market share for credit unions, especially those credit unions that had distinct identities from banks. We also predict that this effect would have been larger in those regions where cooperative organizations, with analogous missions to credit unions, were already more prevalent. However, we also posit that these effects were mitigated in regions where banks co-opted specific features of credit unions, in this case through local philanthropic giving. Using depository data on banks and credit unions from 2004-2012, we find support for our propositions."
2015,"The Role of Boards in CEO Succession Processes: A Behavioral Theory of the Firm Perspective Although the literature suggests that boards of directors have a crucial role in managing CEO successions, systematic knowledge on how decision-making processes unfold in boards is scarce. Drawing on arguments from a behavioral theory of the firm, we propose a three-stage sequential framework that addresses how board performance aspirations (stage 1: ini-tialization process), search intensity (stage 2: search process), and risk assessments (stage 3: decision-making process) affect board effectiveness in deciding who becomes the firms new CEO. In doing so, we highlight the importance of understanding the consequences of deci-sions made throughout the CEO succession process and further develop a set of propositions to guide future research on the topic."
2015,"Passing Down the Throne: The Influence of Performance Feedback on CEO Succession in Family Firms Given the incessant contestation of power inside an organization, how dominant coalitions maintain their power over time is an important topic. We develop a theory on how powerful actors manage their power based on performance feedback. Performance relative to aspiration level signals either competence or inadequacy of the incumbent leadership. The dominant coalition responds to the performance feedback by ceding or fortifying its power so as to manage the contestation toward it and maintain its power. As such, performance feedback represents for the dominant coalition both a threat and an opportunity for its dominance. We test this framework in the context of CEO succession in publicly-listed family firms, the organizations that are characterized by latent contestation between controlling family owners and nonfamily constituencies. Our analysis of Korean family businesses from 2002 to 2008 supports our framework. The controlling family owners resorted to succession by nonfamily CEO when firm performance fell below aspiration level, but engaged in succession by family CEO when performance rose above aspiration. The relative power of the family versus nonfamily constituencies moderated these effects. In addition, the controlling family handed over the CEO post to the subsequent family generation when firm performance is satisfactory and it has more power. Our study sheds light on the management of power, and contributes to research on performance feedback and succession in family business."
2015,"Overcoming the Inertia of Multiplexity: Managing Leadership Successions in Family Firms This paper explores how organizations overcome the inertia of multiplexity as they manage role transitions during organizational change. Extant research in organizations and strategy have emphasized the network-reinforcing benefits of tie multiplexity while neglecting how such reinforcing effects may inhibit the negotiation of new roles during organizational change. As such, how organizations overcome the inertial effects of tie multiplexity to effect role transitions during organizational change is not well-understood. I address this gap by examining father-child leadership succession processes in Chinese family firms. I find that, in father-child successions, the mother plays the role of the boundary-keeper by delineating and maintaining the boundary between the family and professional domains of the father-child relationship. Firms that experienced successful succession events managed their networks in a way that ensured the effectiveness of the mother as the boundary-keeper while firms that experienced failed successions did not. By elucidating how organizations manage the boundary between domains of multiplex ties, this paper contributes to our understanding of how organizations may strategically manage and utilize embeddedness and multiplexity to their advantage. More theoretically, this paper advances the view of embeddedness as something that can be bounded, summoned, and switched on and off rather than a purely antecedent variable to organizational behavior."
2015,"Increases in Status, Perceived Under-Reciprocation, and Social Undermining Among Top Managers This paper explores how social and psychological biases may impede the social exchange relations of executives who ascend to high- status corporate leadership positions. We theorize that a combination of self-serving attribution biases among executives who reach high-status positions, and egocentric biases among their prior benefactors, causes a systematic difference in perceptions between the two parties about the relative importance of that help to the high-status beneficiarys success. This in turn leads to the perception among prior benefactors that the high-status executives have not adequately reciprocated their help. We then extend this theoretical argument, first by suggesting that the perception of under reciprocation is heightened when the high- status executive is a racial minority or a female. Second, we examine how high levels of ingratiation directed toward the high- status executives may contribute to the attribution biases which lead to perceptions of under-reciprocation. The final component of our theoretical framework addresses the significant social consequences of perceived under-reciprocation for the high-status corporate leaders. Specifically, we suggest that the high-status leaders ability to access help when needed is reduced, and they are liable to become the target of social undermining that can damage their broader reputation."
2015,"Measures of Brokerage: Development and Validation of the Discrete Brokerage Orientation Scale New work in social network theory and research has begun to explore the role of social network process alongside social network structure. Where a first wave of social network research located social network process as implicit in social network structure, new work has argued for a more sophisticated capture of the social network action within social network structure principally in the form of three different brokerage action orientations: tertius gaudens, tertius iungens, and conduit between unconnected parties. Empirical work in this emerging research stream has been either qualitative, or quantitatively captured on only one of these increasingly commonly accepted brokerage orientations. We advance this emerging social network process research stream by developing two new measures of brokerage processa measure of mediation and separationto accompany the pre-established tertius iungens measure and by establishing the importance of these multiple measures on critical innovation outcomes."
2015,"Status or Power? Fragile Inference in Social Networks Status and power are two basic mechanisms through which networks generate inequality between social actors. Although in theory different network structures characterize high status and high power positions in exchange networks, we argue that in reality actors who occupy high status positions will also have significant power. Using Bonacich centrality as a measure of the two constructs, we show in simulated and real world networks that status and power are correlated. This suggests that the study of one mechanism and the omission of the other, or an indiscriminate treatment of the two, might have led existing research to attribute observed inequality between actors to status when it is in fact caused by power, or vice versa. We document this concern in an empirical study of the U.S. venture capital industry. We conclude that phenomena of status and power in networks should not be studied in isolation, discuss the implications of our analyses for organizations, and outline avenues for future research."
2015,"Time, Networks, and Text Many theoretically relevant questions on interorganizational networks remain unanswered  or unanswerable  within current research methods. Because answers to these questions require more granular and complete analyzes than hitherto provided, this paper develops a method for the use of text using data elicited from meeting minutes. We illustrate this method and assess its reliability by drawing on monthly data from a building project (2006- 2008). The proposed method was uniquely suited to highlight interconnections among structure, content and context throughout the collaboration among organizations to deliver under time pressure. Our findings informed a multiphase model of dynamic interorganizational networks. Finally, we show how the literature emphasizing the role of cognition, heuristics, and multiplex ties can substantively benefit from our research method."
2015,"Is it a Small World After All? Bringing Null Models to the Foreground We depart from the non-systematic approaches used in our field to identify small world network properties by highlighting the critical role of null models in proper identification of small world (or other) properties. First, we compare data for a representative alliance network in the wireless telecommunications industry against different candidate null models to illustrate the biases that may arise when using Erdos-Renyi random graphs as null models. Then, we propose a more rigorous approach for identifying network properties which replaces the current approach of arbitrary thresholds with confidence intervals derived from the null model. Finally, we detail a variety of network formation mechanisms and contextual constraints which should guide the selection of null models."
2015,"Technological Acquisitions: Signalling the Market using Primary and Secondary Acquisition Motives The paradox of technological acquisitions is that while acquiring a firm for its knowledge or technological capabilities should create value, the evidence is at best mixed. Using a sample with 3,333 U.S. acquisitions, announced between January 1st, 2000 and December 31st, 2010, and a market-based event study, this paper contributes to the paradox in two ways. First, we build upon prior literature which suggests that the market will respond to the signals it receives about the deal. Unlike prior literature, which labels acquisitions in high-tech industries as, per definition, technologically orientated, we identify technological acquisitions using the officially announced acquisition motive. We build a sample of high-tech acquisitions, and consider the press-release as the relevant signal, as opposed to a sample of all acquisitions in the high-tech industry, where the industry flag is the signal. Secondly, and because we build upon the literature which suggests that most acquisitions are driven by multiple motives, we allow for acquiring firms to create mixed signals. We hypothesize: (1) that any secondary acquisition motives, announced in conjunction with a technological acquisition, will be interpreted as a distraction by the market, and thus suggest that the number of secondary motives will negatively moderate the performance of a technological acquisitions; and (2) that the type of secondary motive will signal the firms commitment to the deal, or its nativity. Managers which announce strategically consistent secondary motives, we suggest, will outperform those that announce strategically inconsistent motives. We lay bare the market signaling conditions under which the acquiring firm can create value with a technological acquisition and, in the doing so, contribute to the literature on acquisition motives, and to the literature on the performance of high tech acquisitions."
2015,"Do Increases in R&D; Search Intensity Signal Future Problems? A Behavioral Theory Perspective The Behavioral Theory of the Firm (BTF) predicts that organizational search will generally be backwards looking and myopic. Accordingly, most of the research employing this perspective has looked at the influence of recent past performance on firm search behavior. However, Cyert and Marchs original work, as well as some more recent research, has stressed that search can also sometimes be forward-looking. We build on this perspective to show that since internal signals of future problems motivate firms to increase search, an increase in R&D; search behavior can often signal future performance declines reflected in forward-looking measures of firm performance, such as market valuation. In the process, we examine multiple moderators of the relationship between changes in search and future performance that help to distinguish our theory from alternative explanations based on the Resource Based View and agency theory."
2015,"Product Innovation Rumors as Contributors to Organizational Openness This study is aimed at introducing product innovation rumors as contributors to open governance within organizations. We argue that rumors are instrumental for organizational leaders during product innovations because they can be subject to purposive inflows (i.e. through sensemaking or framing by organizational actors) and outflows (i.e. through engaging in impression management to influence rumor communities). As such, rumors are at the nexus of outside-in and inside-out innovation processes. They are also forms of external transparency towards external constituents and stakeholders. As such, rumors are likely to be key in influencing prominent stakeholders perceptions and therefore rumor communities can act as high-reputation certification providers and holders of soft power during product innovation phases. Furthermore, rumors can be used as a form of impression management, and act as signals to competitors and customers. Broad anecdotal evidence for our theoretical arguments is shown in a sample of data collected from three technology blogs over six years, substantiated by thirty interviews with senior managers in a prominent high-tech company. We propose discourse analytical approaches and textual analyses that recognize rumors as a kind of uncertain knowledge. In nascent markets and fast moving industries such as technology, institutional knowledge is of limited value to an innovation process. Rumors are early information that has unclear truth status. Studying rumors as forms of organizational openness involves many modalities beyond words and accessible through a host of new media such as specialist online communities, blogs, and tweets. We conclude by suggesting research opportunities for the organizational researchers in exploring rumors."
2015,"The Spread of False Ideas through Social Media This research studies the diffusion of false ideas through social media, while under competition from other ideas. Using mined social media data around a particular event, the paper seeks to understand why and how false ideas spread. Preliminary results indicate that while social media provides for an engaging and rapid dissemination of information, its unique features may risk the veracity of information."
2015,"Women Dont Mean Business? Gender Penalty in Board Appointments This paper explores the relationship between board diversity and firm performance. Using 14 years of panel data on U.S. firms, we show that the addition of a female board member has no impact on objective measures of firm performance, but does result in a systematic decrease in the firms market value. We explain this puzzling finding by suggesting that the decision to appoint a female director will alter the markets perception of the appointing firm. Using experimental data, we show that female board appointments are taken as a signal that the firm is motivated by social performance goals, to the detriment of pure profit maximization. In a third panel study, we show that firms perceived to be motivated by social performance goals suffer a decrease in firm value. Collectively, these three studies indicate that female board appointments are perceived as diversity measures, and a signal of a broader commitment of the firm to social welfare goals, as opposed to strict shareholder value maximization. This mechanism, we argue, operates irrespective of the actual or perceived competence of the female candidate. We discuss the implications of our findings for future research on board diversity and firm performance."
2015,"When Experts Become Liabilities: Bankers, Boards, and Bank Failures Existing research on corporate boards has given little attention to an important dimension of board composition: the proportion of domain experts, that is, directors whose primary professional experience is within the focal firms industry. We develop the argument that, in the presence of significant decision uncertainty, a higher proportion of domain experts on a board may detract from effective decision making and thus lead a higher probability of organizational mortality. We derive hypotheses from this argument in the context of local banks in the United States, building on exploratory interviews with board members and CEOs. We predict that the proportion of domain experts in a banks board will be more positively related to the probability of bank failure under conditions associated with greater decision uncertainty in this context, such as rapid asset growth or operation in less predictable markets. Controlling for the level of diversity in board members professional backgrounds, and correcting for the tendency of banks to have an expert- heavy board, longitudinal analyses of 1,307 banks between 1996 and 2012 provide support for our hypotheses. This research highlights the proportion of domain expert directors as a critical but previously overlooked dimension of board composition."
2015,"Politically-Connected Director Heterogeneity and Corporate Social Responsiveness in China The paper theorises and empirically tests the impact of politically-connected directors on the variation in corporate social responsiveness (i.e. donation). Building upon neo- institutional theory, this paper argues that different types of politically-connected directors, specifically Communist-type vs Confucianist-type, have differential impacts on the amount donated, due to their different inherent political values. I test this framework in earthquake donations from Chinese publicly listed firms in 2008. I find that Confucianist-type directors (i.e. part- time congressman-type) have a positive impact on the amount donated, while Communist-type directors (i.e. government official-type) exert a negative effect. These relationships will be moderated by firms recent performance, the type of CEO and political legacy. This study contributes to the literature on neo- institutional theory and enriches our understanding of corporate social responsiveness in the context of emerging economies."
2015,"Director Exit: The Prestige-Power Gap in Newly Public Ventures We examine intra-board social hierarchies as the drivers of director exits from venture boards in the early years after the initial public offering (IPO). Building on the observation that directors care about their relative standing on the board of directors, we advance the notion of a prestige-power gap, i.e. the difference between ones relative prestige and relative power on the board among other outside directors. We find that the prestige-power gap is a significant predictor of director exit, and is moderated by the characteristics of the board (frequency of board meetings, and other directors prestige), the focal director (gender), and the CEO (prestige). Additional analysis suggests that such director exits significantly increase the likelihood and the speed of firms delisting from the stock exchange due to poor performance. Our study contributes a better understanding of the antecedents of director exit, the negative unintended consequences of mandated formal structures (board committees) at IPO, and the social hierarchies in boards of directors and other workgroups."
2015,"Construction of a Community-Based Form of Organizing In this article we examine the different kinds of institutional work that underpin the construction of a new form of organizing. Drawing on an in-depth, qualitative study of a community-based form of organizing for palliative care in Kerala, India, we identify five kinds of institutional work  robust interpretations, local experimentation, indigenous appropriation, contextualized framing and democratic deliberations  that interact dialectically in the construction of a new form. We extend research on forms of organizing by illustrating how a new form aggregates through the local, situated, actions of multiple actors. By uncovering how multivocal interests co-exist during early stages of form construction, we contribute to conversations on distributed agency and inhabited institutions."
2015,"The Followers Role in the Institutionalization of Social Innovations The insights gained in institutional entrepreneurship studies have considerably advanced our understanding of the institutionalization process of social innovations. The focus on a small set of institutional entrepreneurs spearheading field-level social change has led to a relative ne-glect of other actors involved, however. This paper addresses the important role of those fol-lowing after the pioneering institutional entrepreneurs and thus contributing to the spread of social innovations. Through a qualitative exploratory study, I am contributing new insights on the activities of these followers and their hitherto underappreciated challenges. I discuss how the explicit consideration of followers and their challenges can help us address open theoretical issues in neo-institutional theory. In particular, followers efforts to overcome hindrances in locally implementing a novel social innovation provides an important conceptual link from proto-institutions to fully entrenched institutions. Moreover, a focus on the role of followers can explain how proto-institutions may diversify in the institutionalization process. Similarly, the relative strength of followers challenges in their local contexts may help explain why the spread of proto-institutions may remain less then complete in a given field."
2015,"Weeding Out the Competition: How Alternatives are Eliminated during Institutionalization Institutional theory posits that social arrangements are made durable through habitual interactions that render such arrangements so taken for granted that alternatives become literally unthinkable. The specific process through which such arrangements become unthinkable, however, remains under-theorized. This paper argues that institutionalization is often the product of deliberate ongoing work that enables taken-for- grantedness by ensuring that alternatives are forgotten. Using historical methods to examine the emergence of cannabis prohibition in the United States in the first half of the 20th century, we show that the taken-for- grantedness of prohibition depended upon work aimed at eliminating discourses, material artifacts, and social practices that carried meanings capable of undermining prohibitions taken-for- grantedness. We develop a model of the strategies that actors employ to render these rival meanings inaccessible. By focusing on the institutional work that goes into carrying and constraining taken-for-granted meanings, we provide a cognitive mechanism for the emergence of taken-for-grantedness, a fundamental construct whose origins are only sparsely explained by current institutional theory."
2015,"Institutionalizing Hybrids in Italian Health Care: The Case of Public-Private Organizations Based on survey, archival and interview data, our paper studies the institutionalization of a hybrid public-private organizational form in the Italian health care sector. The study contributes to the literature on the emergence of organizational forms by unpacking the relationship of new organizational forms with field structures. Furthermore, we contribute to the literature on institutionalization by focusing our attention on the often overlooked debate on the degrees of institutionalization. Finally, we complement previous field level studies on the diffusion of hybrid forms by providing conceptual clarification of the field conditions favoring diffusion vis--vis those favoring persistence and institutionalization."
2015,"How Strategic Responses to Institutional Complexity Undercut Institutional Microfoundations Organizations are confronted with institutional complexity whenever they face incompatible prescriptions from an existing incumbent logic and from emerging challenger logics. While institutional scholarship has started to generate insight on the organizational level strategic responses to institutional complexity, much less is known about the individual level behavioral implications of institutional complexity. In this study, we advance and test theoretical claims on how organizations internally manage institutional complexity and how their strategic responses to institutional complexity influence individual member behavior. More specifically, we propose that organizations manage institutional complexity by selectively adopting organizational practices embedded in incumbent and challenger logics. The unwanted consequence hereof is that the behavior triggered by the practices embedded in the challenger logics may lead to unintended institutional disruption. Member behaviors may unwittingly undercut the socio-cognitive microfoundations of incumbent logics by undermining the assumptions and beliefs of the incumbent logic, disassociating incumbent organizational practices from their moral foundations, and disconnecting sanctions and rewards from the prescriptions of the incumbent logic. We apply and test our theoretical claims through a field study in the audit industry, a context where disruption behaviors can have highly consequential societal repercussions. By critically reflecting on the dynamics of institutional complexity, organizational practices, and individual member behavior, our findings contribute to a better understanding of the microfoundations of institutional logics."
2015,"Losing the Activist Spirit: Mission Drift and Institutional Logics Vulnerability In this paper we examine how a hybrid organization struggles, and eventually fails, to balance institutional logics in order to avoid mission drift. We explore this in the context of ITCP-FGV (Technological Incubator of Popular Cooperatives) an organization within a private Brazilian business school based on solidarity economy ideology. Our findings show that three mechanisms  shifting demographics, financial sources, and institutional logics vulnerability  have a great impact on mission drift. We suggest institutional logics are more vulnerable (and thus become a peripheral logic or even disappear) if the logic a) is under-represented from within the organization, b) has an insufficient degree of institutionalization, c) lacks institutional logic referents at higher levels and, d) appears in an organization at the fields periphery and is thus less susceptible to the fields normative influence. Moreover, we propose that spaces of reflexivity are a crucial instrument to avoid mission drift, since they allow for protecting vulnerable logics."
2015,"Professional Role Identity as a Filter for Institutional Complexity This article explores how and why two factions of the asset management profession responded differently to new demands for Socially Responsible Investment (SRI). Employing a longitudinal ethnographic case study design, we trace how key aspects of professional role identity led one faction of the profession to perceive the emergent demands for SRI as compatible with the dominant financial logic guiding the profession; while another faction perceived them as inherently incompatible. By shedding light on how locally-situated professionals mediate institutional demands in their everyday work, this study makes two main contributions to existing research. First, the model that we advance contributes to current discussions linking professional identity and institutional logics  articulating how role identity shapes the ways in which asset managers frame and respond to institutional complexity. Second, the study provides key insights into the unfolding nature of institutional complexity  specifically, the recursive interplay between responses and the subsequent experience of complexity. Our findings show how disagreements among field constituents over appropriate responses to new institutional demands heightened the experience of complexity within the asset management sector  ultimately threatening to undermine the cohesion of the profession, and hindering efforts to restore investor confidence following the recent financial crisis."
2015,"From Institutional Contradictions to Organizational Transformation Institutionalists have proposed different approaches to how organizations manage in-stitutional contradictions. In particular, they have suggested that competing institutional logics within organizations are either managed through prioritization, separation, or hybridization of practices. Yet, why and how organizations respond to institutional contradictions by a quan-tum leap and change the organizational gestalt or paradigm has been an underexplored issue. Therefore, we addressed this question in our research of a unique university merger, in which two very different institutional logics collided in practice. The findings show that after years of failed attempts with a hybridization and marginalization approach, the organization re-sponded by a radical gestalt change. This presents a major deviation from existing evidence and the prevailing debate in the literature. We suggest an institutional model of organizational transformation as a fourth approach filling a blind spot in the literature and anchoring a new end of the spectrum of organizational responses to institutional contradictions."
2015,"Broadly Specialized: Identity and Entry into Entrepreneurship One of the core findings in entrepreneurship research highlights the benefits of breadth, linking the mastery of different roles and skills to higher likelihood of entry. However, sociological research finds repeated evidence that breadth reduces the appeal of an individual to their focal audience. We develop hypotheses for how prospective entrepreneurs navigate this tension through the use of distinctiveness and compensatory strategies and test these on the likelihood that a recording artist launched their own label. To estimate these we use a unique sample of the skills and appeals made by 5,000 recording artists between 1990-2010. We find that acquiring a distinct set of broad skills and making a narrow, but conventional appeal, increase the likelihood that an individual would launch their own record label."
2015,"Rubber Stamping: The Contingent Effect of Firm Prestige on Entrepreneurial Mobility The antecedents of entrepreneurial mobility is an important line of inquiry in the study of entrepreneurship. Specifically, extant literature has focused on the role of the firm prominence, or status, on the likelihood that an employee leaves wage employment to start a new venture, i.e., entrepreneurial mobility. However, this literature has not yet examined what type of employee is the most likely to take advantage of their employers status. We offer a novel mechanism that might underline the impact of status on this entrepreneurial mobility. Leveraging the recent literature that links performance to entrepreneurial mobility, we argue that the returns to status benefit a specific class of employee: those that are underperforming relative to others at their firm. This hypothesis is tested using data from the mutual fund industry. Entrepreneurial mobility among lower ranked performers is found to be more likely for those employed at a high-status firm. Further, we observe that though these employees are low-performers at their firm they are not low-performers compared to others in their industry. We conclude with a discussion about possible explanations related to resource holder evaluation and threat of termination."
2015,"From Hierarchies to Markets: Wage Inequality and Mobility into Entrepreneurship Research on organizational stratification and mobility concerns with individual mobility within and across established organization, while mobility into entrepreneurship has received much less attention. The present paper theorizes on the link between organizational wage inequality and mobility into entrepreneurship. In doing so, the paper makes an important distinction between wage inequality based on human capital variations (explained wage inequality) and that does not (residual wage inequality) while predicting implications for mobility into entrepreneurship. Empirical evidence obtained from Swedish business service sector confirms our prediction that while explained wage inequality constrains mobility into entrepreneurship, residual wage inequality facilitate the same."
2015,"The Imprint of Local Labor Markets on Entrepreneurial Performance We examine the effects of local labor markets on the long-term earnings trajectory of entrepreneurs. Using the 1979-2010 waves of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), a multi-stage stratified national probability sample, our study tracks the earnings of individual entrepreneurs from the beginning of their careers. Results show that unfavorable local labor markets pull in individuals who are otherwise ill-prepared to start their own businesses, in terms of human capital and work experience. This in turn leads those individuals to enter business ownership with lower initial earnings, a penalty that widens when they persist in entrepreneurial activity. We also look at four factors expected to alleviate the imprinting effect of local labor markets: serial entrepreneurship, exits from the community of initial entrepreneurial activity, prior work experience in family business, and entrepreneurial success. However, none of these factors make the initial effect of local labor markets disappear. The findings suggest an imprinting effect of entering entrepreneurship in an economically deprived community that lingers over time."
2015,"Organizational Learning in Social Enterprises: Navigating Implicit and Dynamic Boundaries We micro-analysed organizational learning interactions in social enterprises from a boundary perspective. Using qualitative data from four Indian social enterprises, we identified two implicit boundaries  competence and social  which in isolation and through mutual interactions impacted learning. Dynamic stakeholder interaction configurations, learning mechanisms and critical agents were identified for each boundary. Immersion through lived experience rather than mere membership of the target community enabled learning across social boundaries. Learning involved interactions between competence and social boundaries, with middle managers playing a critical integration role in the process. Within the enterprise, horizontal overlaps between competence boundaries at the middle management level (through specific integration mechanisms) supported learning."
2015,"The Post-Acquisition Integration Process and the Role of Integration Managers Whereas target shareholders almost always seem to win in Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A;), research dealing with this topic has unveiled mixed results concerning the returns to acquirer shareholders. By taking a social network perspective and focusing on the role of integration managers (IMs), we assume these miscellaneous findings to be ascribable to the integration process underlying each acquisition. Based on in-depth interviews with IMs and target employees in a multiple case study we qualitatively explore the mechanisms and logics inherent in the yet unclear black box of the integration process. Our results contribute to research on network characteristics and network evolution and its impact on the creation and diffusion of knowledge. We demonstrate that successful IMs establish key social ties between acquirer and target early on, thereby facilitating the timely transfer of important tacit knowledge between relevant actors. This transfer, in turn, leads to a more efficient and effective integration process, making the acquisition more successful. Our results help to explain the hybrid findings concerning acquirer returns in acquisitions and enable the acquirers to structure their integration processes through the deployment of IMs more effectively and efficiently."
2015,"How Firms Impact City Change: A Capability Perspective on Collective Action in Cities Firms have discovered cities as one of the next big market opportunities, since cities all around the globe search for solutions that enable them to cope with issues such as massive migration or greenhouse gas emission. In order to adapt to the ongoing population growth and to mitigate their negative environmental impact, municipalities foster the renewal and digitalization of their infrastructures and processes, hoping to identify opportunities for restructuring municipal services in a smart, i.e. information-based and synergy exploiting, way. Despite the shared Smart City vision of private and public actors, most strategic initiatives to transform cities towards this vision have failed. We argue that this is because the firms implementing Smart City solutions have failed to develop the institutional capabilities to effectively frame and enact their solutions. To succeed, they need to become aware of the institutional environment they are acting in, nest their solutions in the structure of prevailing political-administrative plans and enact it in the respective residential environment. Hereto, we develop a dynamic capability model for collective action and develop propositions that explain how firms socially construct opportunities and create the legitimacy to yield solution adoption within a city-field. Combining capability and collective action research helps bridging the gap between strategic management and institutional literature, yields a deeper understanding of nonmarket capabilities and provides actors with effective instruments for acting in environments that follow other than economic logics."
2015,"From Gaps to Tangles: A Relational Framework for the Theory-Practice Debate  The article contributes to a better understanding of the relation between organization theory and managerial practice. It examines different literatures to identify positions in how organization theories relate to management practice in the theory-practice debate. It finds positions are founded on a similar set of dichotomies -academics versus practitioners, rigor versus relevance, cognition versus action and science versus commonsense- that propel a debate that moves in circles instead of forwards towards new areas of inquiry. However it is shown that dichotomies are often exaggerated because of the excessive focus on theory-practice gaps and the lack of attention to theory-practice interrelationships. To demonstrate how dichotomies may be reconciled, the paper proposes a new position - entanglement- according to which relations between scholarly and managerial theories and scholarly and managerial practices constitute iterative processes in which organization scholars and management practitioners resourcefully combine action and cognition and science and commonsense to create hybrid and dialogic knowledge according to multiple systems of relevance -institutional constraints, personal interests and contexts of cross-boundary interaction. Therefore the paper proposes a research agenda to study such process-based manifestations and discusses implications for the theory-practice debate"
2015,"Red, Blue, and Purple Firms: On the Coherence and Implications of Organizational Ideology Building on the premise that many organizations have deeply embedded ideologies, we examine the influence of these ideologies on adoption of socially progressive practices by profit-seeking firms. Adopting the conservatism-liberalism dimension for characterizing ideologies, we hypothesize that more liberal firms  owing to their beliefs in equality, shared responsibility, and social change  will a) exhibit greater advances in corporate social responsibility, b) appoint more women to executive ranks, and c) more readily enact equal benefits for gay and lesbian employees, compared to more conservative firms. We also hypothesize that the effects of ideology are most pronounced when a given progressive practice is rare among industry peers. Using a novel, reliable, and replicable measure of organizational ideology based on political contributions by employees, we test our ideas using a longitudinal panel of Fortune 500 firms. With a comprehensive array of controls (including for prior values of dependent variables, executive ideology, industry, headquarters locale, and others), we find strong support for our hypotheses. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of organizational ideology, and we propose an extensive research agenda for further exploration of this important construct."
2015,"Institutional Heterogeneity and Corporate Social Responsibility: The Impact of Red and Blue This paper contributes to the debate concerning the relationship between politics and business activity by investigating the influence of a heterogeneous institutional context on corporate social responsibility practices. Building on institutional theory, we propose that the institutional context in blue states, which are governed by the Democratic Party, creates a more favorable environment for positive CSR practices than the context in red states, which are governed by the Republican Party. Moreover, we expect the positive CSR practices to increase as the state becomes bluer, and to decrease as the state becomes redder. By analyzing a sample of 2,673 U.S. corporations in 2006, we contribute to the research in institutional theory and management by showing that institutional contexts are influenced by political and geographic heterogeneity which has a significant impact on firms CSR practices."
2015,"The Politics of Corporate Political Choices Corporations are under increasing social pressure to avoid political donations. Yet campaign contributions remain an important mechanism to earn economic favors. We argue that this conflict between the social and the economic expectations increase the likelihood of the decoupling of corporate disclosures of political donations from their actual contributions. We use a unique context to examine our hypotheses. We compare the political donations declared by 108 Indian firms between 2004 and 2011 with their receipts as reported by the national political parties. Consistent with our argument, we find that the decoupling of corporate political donations is strongly associated with the threat of negative social reaction. While firms with large charitable and marketing expenditures are more likely to decouple political donations, firms relying on non-transparent intermediaries for their contributions exhibit lower decoupling. We also find that over time, social and legal pressures decrease the magnitude of decoupling. This decrease in decoupling, however, is stronger for firms that are relatively transparent than for firms more experienced with decoupling."
2015,"The Political Role of Business and Democratic Illegitimacy Whether and how the political role of business can be democratically legitimate is a critical issue when the practices of a multitude of actors and technologies of power in national and global societal and political settings are becoming increasingly intertwined. Aiming for a resolution, business scholars have increasingly turned to theories of deliberative democracy. This, we argue, is a problematic route ahead as normative democratic theories, and the Habermasian theory of deliberative democracy in particular, exclude businesses as legitimate societal actors in democratic processes. Moreover, extant research is more about political or moral legitimacy than democratic legitimacy. To overcome the seeming incommensurability between the practices of business in societies and theories on democracy, we propose a turn to more pragmatic theories on democracy in global governance. We further outline a research agenda for cross-fertilization between scholars on pragmatic democratic theories and scholars on the political role of business."
2015,How Do Information and Communication Technology Affect Delegation? This paper investigates the distinct effects of the use of information technology and communication technology in firms on the degree of delegation of decision making. This paper contributes to the literature on organization design by showing empirically that these two types of technology have distinct effects on delegation at the level of analysis of delegation from manager to employees: delegation is more likely when database software is used and it is less likely when communication software is employed. We use a longitudinal and nationally representative dataset from Statistics Canadas Workplace and Employee Survey to test the theory.
2015,"The Organization Made Us Do it: Demanding Formalization and Workaround Attributions We call attention to an interesting paradox, which is that the same technologies intended to help employees do their jobs more safety result in numerous unintended and often overlooked cognitive, emotional and physical demands on the users and recipients of those technologies. We argue that the unintended negative aspects of technology that have been articulated by organization theory have been overlooked in other disciplines. Toward a better understanding of how employees respond to this paradox, we apply the formalization literature from organization theory to introduce and test the concept of demanding formalization which we define as perceptions of the extent to which the workflow blocks, constraints and rules embedded in safety technologies place unintentional emotional, physical and cognitive demands on employees. Thus we offer a Janus-faced theoretical model which explores both the enabling and demanding aspects of formalization and how they apply to workarounds, which are idiosyncratic methods for overcoming workflow blocks. In this model, organizational workaround attributions play a central role in understanding the relationship between formalization attitudes and outcomes: demanding formalization facilitates a perception among employees that organizational dysfunction compels them to engage in workarounds, leading to organizational withdrawal and diminishing technology acceptance. We find empirical support for these assertions in a study of a large sample of nurses in three different US healthcare organizations."
2015,"Making Sense of the Impact Big Data Will Have on Organizational Structure The aim of this paper is to analyze the impact the use of Big Data within organizations will have on organizational structure and individual decision making. By reference to examples of currently observed Big Data usages, I try enrooting this emerging phenomenon in the organization literature and propose that this new technology can enable the rise of more decentralized, democratic and organic organizations. In particular, I argue that the increasing amount and clarity of information Big Data can extract and analyze reduces the informational uncertainty faced by individuals, in so doing, allowing for a more decentralized decision making process and that this may free up resources at the top of the management ladder which can be taken advantage of through employees empowerment and resource flexibility."
2015,"Self-Identity and Regulatory Focus in Governance of Online Communities A fast growing stream of literature has shown tremendous interests in the wisdom of crowds, which is embedded in various forms of online communities (OCs). However, studies on the governance of OCs are rather scattered. Our knowledge on how key governance mechanisms are interrelated is very much limited to date. Thus, the purposes of this paper are to: (1) highlight the unique exchange relationships within OCs based on theories of transaction cost economics, social exchange, and transactive memory system; (2) identify in OCs and link key governance mechanisms with two key constructs in the social psychology domain, i.e., self-identity and regulatory focus."
2015,"Halos or Egos? External Rankings and Internal Collaboration in U.S. Hospitals 2002-2011 This paper examines the effect that external third-party rankings have on collaboration networks within organizations. Using detailed patient-level treatment data for over 10 million in-patient stays drawn from a broad national sample of hospitals in the US between 2002 and 2011, the paper finds that a rise in a specialtys ranking in the US News & World Reports Best Hospitals in the US list is associated with a decrease in the likelihood of collaboration through deference (i.e., ego effect) and an increase in the likelihood of other specialties deferring to the specialty (i.e., halo effect). This effect was stronger when the focal specialty was of high prestige (e.g., cancer or cardiovascular), but weaker when ranked in the top half of hospital specialties."
2015,"Social Relational Foundations of Peer Evaluation In nearly every social and economic setting individuals evaluate one another. Evaluations are a necessary component for status attribution, rewards and penalties, and impact the social, economic, and psychological welfare of individuals. By implication, evaluation has considerable impact on organizational processes and outcomes. In this paper, we focus attention on the effects of the evaluators social network on evaluation outcomes. We present results from a field intervention in which we implement a peer-to-peer based evaluation system in a business school setting. Our model includes both ascriptive and relational (e.g., friendship) characteristics of the evaluator-evaluated dyad, as well as the social structure within which the dyad is embedded. Using this fine-grained dataset we find strong evidence that connections matter, and that peers affect evaluation outcomes. Consistent with our predictions, individuals with broad networks rich in open triad counts receive more favorable evaluations. By contrast, evaluators with more open triad counts give more negative evaluations of their peers, suggesting that broad networks have opposing effects, contingent on an individuals role as evaluator or evaluated."
2015,"Do all Critics Have the Same Impact? A Critics Networks Analysis in Platform Organizations Platform organizations, firms that provide an interface for other firms and their clients to develop and exchange different products, technologies, services, and other organizational functions, have gained much importance in todays business environment. Many of these organizations add value to the exchange process by, among other things, providing evaluation systems based on critics judgments. However, literature on platforms is rather silent about the mechanisms used to reinforce these evaluation systems. In this paper, we propose that critics' participation in the platform will evolve into something similar to implicit knowledge networks, with critics occupying different positions in these networks. Based on theories of social construction of markets, we theorize that not all critics are expected to have the same effects on the economic value of exchanges between sellers and buyers. We also theorize the effects of dual roles played by the same participants on these exchanges. We test our hypotheses using data from an organization that hosts high-quality coffee competitions around the globe and provides an online auction platform for the exchange of those coffees. The analysis has been complemented with an application of a network visualization technique."
2015,"Appreciation or Awareness? Differential Preferences for Category Spanning in an Online Community Literature in organizational sociology states that category spanners  producers or products that span multiple categories  are less appealing to audiences than actors that do not span categories. Scholars also provide instances, however, where category spanners are advantaged. Audiences may interpret the same category spanning behavior from different perspectives based on their own experience and knowledge on the market. As such, we suggest a closer investigation of audience heterogeneity in expertise to help explain these mixed findings. When audiences broadly interact with the market domain, will they gain appreciation or awareness of category spanners? In a market where actors can simultaneously be both producers and consumers, we argue for a homophily preference  a greater liking of actors with homogeneous category spanning experience  which leads knowledgeable audience members to appreciate category spanners. Using a longitudinal dataset of an online community where individuals posted reviews on a variety of pre- categorized products, we find that sharing category membership leads to positive evaluations. Moreover, we find category spanners tend to be positively evaluated by other category spanners while negatively evaluated by their peers who do not span categories. The lack of homogeneous experience between audience and actor, rather than merely category-spanning behavior, leads category spanners to be penalized."
2015,"Stability and Change of Organizational Routines and the Role of Managerial Authority This paper uses empirical data to examine the conditions under which endogenous and exogenous factors shape routine dynamics, i.e., the stability and change of action patterns by which tasks are carried out. We find that action patterns for carrying out the task we study are typically not stable over time, and that while several endogenous and exogenous factors can both increase and decrease the sequential variety of these action patterns, whether they do so depends on the degree of formal managerial authority applied to a routine. Our findings point to an important aspect of routine dynamics, namely both their boundary conditions and their strategic root cause: By defining the degree of discretion of those who carry out the routine, organization designers can influence when routine dynamics occur, what sources they have, and whether or not they are useful for attaining the objectives of the organization. We discuss implications for theory and practice."
2015,"Group Decision Rules and Exploratory/Exploitative Competences This paper aims to extend research on organizational learning by investigating the effects of decision rules on organizational decision-making and on competences in exploration and exploitation. Presuming that organizations consist of multiple actors, decision rules are suggested to administer the process of aggregating different opinions. The authors argue that various decision rules may have important influence on the outcomes of organizational search and learning by organizing the collective choices between exploratory and exploitative activities. Furthermore, the authors discuss a levels-of- analysis issue in organizational competence development. By treating competences as constructs at the individual-level and at the aggregate-level, the authors find conflicting results on the pattern of competence development."
2015,"Never Change a Winning Routine? Experimental Evidence on Performance Feedback Effects on Routines This study explores the effects of performance feedback on organizational routines. In a laboratory experiment (N=184) with a 2 (performance level relative to aspirations: high vs. low)  3 (feedback timing: early vs. continuous vs. late) design and a separate control condition, in which no feedback was provided, we analyze how routine change in the Cohen and Bacdayan (1994) card game is guided by reported performance levels and feedback timing. We differentiate between routine replacements and adjustments and show that both types of change are intertwined in that newly formed routines draw from previously established behavioral patterns. We find that feedback suggesting performance below aspirations is related to routine replacement, whereas we find no association between feedback above aspirations and routine replacement. Using the Cohen and Bacdayan (1994) measures for routinization as indicators for routine adjustment, we find that positive as well as negative feedback relates to decreases in speed and that, if provided early in the game, feedback suggesting low performance leads to a more efficient use of repeated action sequences. This indicates that feedback may go in line with routine adjustments which affect the efficiency of routines. Furthermore, by varying the timing of feedback interventions, we find that feedback effects on routine replacement decrease with game progress. Our findings help resolve contradictions in the prevailing theory and reconcile traditional entity theories with theories on routines as generative systems."
2015,"Building Ambidexterity by Structural Differentiation: The Moderating Role of Organizational Context Research has proposed that ambidexteritythe ability to balance exploitation and explorationis critical to firms performance and survival, yet scholars still debate the appropriate management modes to facilitate it. Our study investigates the effectiveness of combining structural differentiation with organizational context in establishing an appropriate environment for firms ambidexterity. Survey data collected from 128 Brazilian companies suggest that organizational context interacts with structural elements to help large firms create and maintain ambidexterity. Significantly, our results do not show the same effect for medium-size companies, where the need for structural differentiation is lower."
2015,"Uses and Misuses of Complexity Concepts: Towards a Complexity Theory of Organizations Organizational scholars have frequently drawn on complexity theory, a trans- disciplinary branch of knowledge whose roots lie in mathematics, and that touches applied natural and life sciences. We review the organizational and management literatures invoking concepts from complexity theory and examining the concept of complexity, and identify a variety of ways in which the key concepts of complexity theory have been conceptualized. We further identify ways in which the emerging field of organizational complexity theory has borrowed concepts and ideas from other disciplines and examine the fruitfulness of such borrowing and the uses and misuses of complexity theoretical concepts in organizational studies. We conclude by outlining a model of organizational complexity theory that has its foundations in the established understanding of organizations."
2015,"Disentangling the Spectrum from Complexity Reduction to Induction from a Practice Perspective Unexpected events pose a significant challenge to organizations as they are vastly complex and overwhelm organizational information procession. Although there is a large body of research on unexpected events as well as on complexity that look at the same challenge from different angles, these streams only modestly inform each other. Whereas the more phenomenon driven research on unexpected events aims at describing well established practices to handle such encounters, more theoretically oriented complexity theory outlines considerations regarding organizational structures to allow for organizations to posit them effectively in a world of complexity. By combining them, a surprising insight lit up: The vast amount of practices put forward in research on unexpected events can be ordered along a complexity spectrum from reducing complexity under unexpected circumstances, maintaining or even inducing it. When comparing two distinctly gathered data sets from a catastrophe organization (THW) and an ICU ward of a university hospital in the realm of unexpected events research, we realized that the set of practices applied in both settings significantly varied with regards to complexity. Whereas the THW primarily drew on complexity reductionist practices, the ICU far more relied on complexity maintaining or inducing practices. Thus, we subjected the data sets to a comparative analysis to investigate if there are systematic differences in the settings that explain the different stances towards complexity. Grounded in our data, we discuss these conditions in detail and outline how they contribute to complexity theory as well as research on unexpected events and both streams overlap."
2015,"The Interplay between Control and Complexity in a Large and New Organization: A Process Study The larger the organization, the more complex it is. Managers tend to deal with complexity by introducing new controls, which in turn are likely to increase complexity. This study explores how this vicious circle works and how firms can get out of it. We draw on complexity theory to explore how control mechanisms are related to complexity and why the interplay between the two changes over time. We adopt a process view, drawing on in- depth data from a large newly created European organization consisting of six local offices distributed over different countries. Our analysis demonstrates that top management primarily implements input and behavior controls and thereby increases regulative and manifest complexity. In contrast to that, office managers implement input and behavior controls that primarily serve to reduce relational complexity. We develop the concept of prescriptive and synergic controls to differentiate between controls that, respectively, increase and decrease organizational complexity. In addition, we identify three generative mechanisms explaining the dynamics of controls in complex organizations, for instance one where control first increases complexity, creates non-working control mechanisms and then reinforces the need for new controls. Our findings provide important insights for rolling out a balanced system of controls as a response to complexity."
2015,"Exploring Creative Process Dynamics Creativity is one of the most important and prevalent of human activities (Simonton, 2000) but paradoxically it is also one which is still relatively little understood. The capacity to generate new ideas and think creatively is increasingly recognized as critical for the long-term survival of individuals, teams and organizations. Focused on the different individual, collective, contextual, cognitive - explanatory variables of creative outcomes, theory offers an incomplete explanation of the creative process. Our results show that the creative process is complex and highly uncertain. Using Complexity Theory concepts, we attempt to provide a more fine-grained explanation of the creative process unfolds. We confirm the existence of the distinct phases and highlight the role of social resources in creative process phase transitions. We also show the amplification of creative ideas via positive feedbacks and the role of order generating simple rules in the creative process dynamics."
2015,"Coordination Processes in Expert Teams Despite longstanding research into coordination, it is poorly understood how work is coordinated in teams of collaborating experts. This question is particularly urgent given that modern work entails increasing specialization and more collaboration in diverse teams. This article adds a rigorous examination of how two key drivers of coordination process  difference between specializations and interdependency  impact the coordination process. To sharpen these two drivers, I frame the first as diversity in specialization, and the second as coupling. I then differentiate two categories of activities that experts pursue in their work. The article examines how and why diversity and coupling drive the temporal occurrence of activities over time. It develops a process model that enables an assessment and comparison of coordination processes across teams. The discussion positions the model against theories of team and coordination process. Implications point to the role of the temporal embeddedness and nestedness of activities in organizations."
2015,"Scaling in the Dark: Explaining Repertoire Escalation in Dark Communities A large literature examines how communities organize for activism, social support, recreation or production goals, but organizational research seldom examines communities where secrecy is paramount. In dark communities, individuals connected by a common social identity, norms and practices, work toward collective goals covertly, keeping their personal identities secret and activities surreptitious to avoid exposure, infiltration and/or retaliation. Yet, most theories of community organizing emphasize how individuals organize by sharing and revealing their work to make tasks more visible and understandable to others. How do dark communities organize their activities when the act of collaboration puts both individuals and their community at risk? In this inductive field study, we examined the activities of Anonymous, a community engaged in both lawful and unlawful forms of protest and civil disobedience. By examining how the community escalated their repertoire of organizing practices in light of emerging opportunities and threats, we contribute a fine-grained understanding of how dark communities reconfigure their operations in ways that further the community's capabilities and enable them to scale."
2015,"Organizational Design and Coordinating Dirty Work Dirty work contexts refer to occupational settings characterized by marginal status, poor job design and stigmatization. While the literature has tended to focus on issues of manager and employee identity, organizational design challenges associated with coordinating dirty work have so far been neglected. Using exploratory, semi-structured interviews with healthcare professionals and front-line workers in the National AIDS Control Organization of India (NACO), this qualitative paper examines how interdependent activities are coordinated in spite of organization design failures induced by inherent characteristics of dirty work occupations. Our findings show how emergent responses at an individual level mitigate coordination failures to integrate interdependent tasks at an organizational level. Contributions to practice theories of coordination are discussed, as is the need to broaden our definition of dirty work to enable future research into the effects of stigma on organization design failure at multiple levels."
2015,"Creating Anomalous Practices through Assemblage: Insights from the Dutch Bio-energy Field Departing from the traditional emphasis on stability and homogeneity, institutional scholars currently conceptualize new practice creation as the product of improvisation and reflection on preexisting practices. However, these ideas stop short of explaining how anomalous practices materialize, especially those that cannot be attributed to an existing practice. Using a comparative multi-case longitudinal study, this article diverges from these concepts in order to detail how anomalous practices emerge through assemblage. Findings demonstrate that practitioners: form hybrid frames to reimagine problems and solutions; code anomalous practices through collaborative experimentation and semiosis; and spatially and temporally territorialize practice anomalies as they put novel practices into motion. The resulting assemblage framework has several implications for institutional theory as well as for the ontology of practices."
2015,"Variation in Institutional Pressures and Organizational Responses to Pluralism The aim of this paper is to develop a model of organizational responses to pluralism derived from selective coupling. We predict that, in fields characterized by competing logics, the adoption of logics stipulations depends on their centrality with respect to both logics. Central stipulations to one logic and peripheral to the other one are adopted, while, when stipulations are central to both logics, blending and compromising is expected. Similarly, stronger compliance pressures from one logic lead to increasing adoption of central stipulations to that logic, but not of peripheral stipulations in conflict with the competing logic. We test quantitatively these hypotheses on 26 universities in eight European countries, which are subject to different managerial pressures due to national policies. While confirming our hypotheses, these results extend previous work in three directions. First, we show that the distinction between core and peripheral stipulation of logics plays a central role in determining responses. Second, we extend compartimentalization to a broader set of possible responses, where different degrees of adoption are found and blending takes place in case of overt conflict. Third, we provide evidence on the differential impact of increasing institutional pressures, depending on the level of centrality of the stipulation."
2015,"Earnings Pressure and Corporate Philanthropy: The Influence of Analysts and Foreign Exposure This study examines how emerging-market firms respond to external market pressures and constraints by altering their corporate philanthropy (CP) expenditures, as well as how analyst coverage plays a disciplinary role in this process. Using theory and research on CP and institutional logics, we argue that the existence of two competing logics regarding the long-term value of CP influence firm responses as well as the disciplinary role of analyst coverage. We introduce foreign exposure C operationalized as foreign sales and cross-listing C as a contingency variable that defines the relative dominance of the two divergent logics and therefore influence both firms and analysts in their CP decisions. We find empirical support for our hypotheses based on an analysis of manufacturing firms listed in China during the period of 2006 C 2012."
2015,"Responding to Complexity within a State Logic: Environmental Responsibility Reporting in China The extant literature attributes institutional complexity to the concurrence of multiple, often conflicting logics. In this study, we explore the institutional complexity within a single dominant logic, the state logic in China. We find that different hierarchical levels of the state body have conflicting selections of priorities between economic and sustainable development, leading to an in-depth complexity within the state logic. Meanwhile, a consistent environmental governance system is shared among all levels of the state to facilitate corporate environmentalism through multiple areas of jurisdictions, constituting a horizontal dimension of the state logic. Drawing on 5-year panel data on the reporting of corporate environmental responsibility from listed firms, we unpack how the multifaceted manifestation of the state logic exert institutional pressures on organizations. The outcome of our 56 interviews in the field also helps further interpret our regression results."
2015,"When A+B Does Not Equal B+A: Asymmetrical Combinations and Performance in Microfinance This paper tests propositions about organizations facing multiple demands, and builds theory about differences in organizational hybridization and its consequences. Prior work suggests that in order to avoid conflicted or compromised performance, organizations concentrate on performance related to only one set of demands. Yet recent work has suggested that hybrid organizational configurations might be able to simultaneously fulfill multiple sets of demands. I compare the performance of hybrid and non-hybrid organizations, as well as different types of hybrid organizations. I propose and find that hybrid organizations without barriers to integration are most able to achieve high performance relative to two sets of demands. These dynamics have observable outcomes in the microfinance industry, where performance is measured relative to multiple demands. Findings have implications for hybrid organizing, and are likely to have implications for any organization attempting to satisfy two different sets of demands."
2015,"A Behavioral Agency Explanation of Managerial Effort Level and Effort Alignment: Money versus Jobs Classical agency theory and its associated practice focus almost exclusively on extrinsic motivation and the design of monetary incentives for explaining managerial effort levels and effort alignment. In this article, we challenge the realism and usefulness of this assumption for the purpose of corporate governance. Using data from a large-scale survey of Norwegian managers, we show that monetary incentives only explain a small amount of variance in extrinsic motivation, effort levels and effort alignment. The motivational potential of the managers jobs on the other hand explain a substantial amount of variance in intrinsic motivation and effort levels. We find no evidence that the presence of extrinsic incentives crowds out intrinsic motivation. However, we find a hitherto undiscovered crowding effect, i.e. that intrinsic motivation appear to crowd out extrinsic motivation."
2015,"Who Can Stand Up for Good Governance? Evidence from Board Committees This paper contributes to research on board committees by analyzing the impact of a symbolic or substantial role of committees on their decision making quality using the example of audit committees. Based on an international sample comprising 2,410 firm-year observations from 16 European countries between 2005 and 2010, we analyze the effect of audit committee standing on earnings management as an indicator for audit committee decision making quality. Furthermore, we investigate the interdependency of corporate governance practices and national institutions, specifically country-level disclosure and shareholder protection. We find that audit committee standing affects decision making quality. Moreover, we find evidence for both disclosure and shareholder protection to affect this relationship suggesting the importance of national institutions in influencing of governance practices."
2015,"Making the Numbers? Short Termism and the Puzzle of Only Occasional Disaster Much recent work in strategy and popular discussion suggests that an excessive focus on managing the numbersdelivering quarterly earnings at the expense of longer term performancemakes it difficult for firms to make the investments necessary to build competitive advantage. Short termism has been blamed for everything from the decline of the US automobile industry to the low penetration of techniques such as TQM and continuous improvement. Yet a vigorous tradition in the accounting literature establishes that firms routinely sacrifice long-term investment to manage earnings and are rewarded for doing so. This paper presents a model that reconciles these apparently contradictory perspectives. We show that if the source of long-term advantage is modeled as a stock of capability that accumulates over time, the intensity of the firms effort to manage short-term earnings at the expense of long-term investment can have very different consequences depending on whether the firms capability is close to a critical tipping threshold. When the firm operates above this threshold, aggressively managing earnings smoothes revenue and cash flow with few long-term consequences. Below it, managing earnings can tip the firm into a vicious cycle of accelerating decline. Our results have important implications for understanding managerial incentives and the internal processes that create sustained advantage."
2015,"Internal Audit Quality: The Joint Importance of Independence and Competence In light of the growing importance of internal audit functions (IAF) and the limited archival evidence on internal audit quality, we examine an interactive model of IAF quality (comprised of competence and independence) to better understand the determinants of IAF effectiveness as financial reporting monitors. Our competence variable captures average hourly IAF compensation. We incorporate three distinct facets of independence: degree of audit committee oversight, IAF management training grounds, and IAF outsourcing. Our tests support the hypothesis that the joint presence of competence and independence is a necessary antecedent to effective IAF financial reporting monitoring. In sum our results show that if one wishes to ask what is the effect of internal audit competence (independence) on financial reporting quality, the answer is it depends on the independence (competence) of the internal auditor. Our study extends the understanding of IAF quality determinants in the as it relates to ongoing discussions by researchers, standard setters, regulators, and practitioners."
2015,"Here's an Idea: Knowledge Sharing among Competitors to Build a Critical Mass Knowledge sharing among competitors is counterintuitive; however, it has been found to occur in the economy under certain conditions. Recently, in the investment industry, platforms with the goal of promoting knowledge sharing among investment professionals have emerged. This knowledge sharing is noteworthy for two reasons: (1) the conditions that have previously been found to sustain knowledge sharing among competitors are not present, and (2) it is at odds with the neoclassical efficient- market hypothesis (EMH). Using a limitation of the EMH framework, I posit that expectations regarding the strength of the markets efficiency for a stock, measured as the amount of information available about that firm and the level of scrutiny it faces from key market institutions, plays an important role in sustaining this knowledge sharing. Using a unique dataset of knowledge sharing among investment professionals, on an online platform, this study leverages variation in the platform's sharing structure to test this theory. I find that knowledge sharing is most prominent for stocks that have less information available and that face a lesser degree of scrutiny from key market institutions. These findings highlight how market inefficiencies can sustain knowledge sharing among competitors, especially when a critical mass is needed."
2015,"Scientific Collaboration and Emergence of Technology Systems: A Case of Nanotechnology In this study, I argue that scientific collaboration facilitates emergence of technological systems. Technological systems are defined as regional sources of knowledge and competence (i.e. the presence of local scientists, university educational programs, patents filed by regional organizations) that develop and diffuse technical and scientific knowledge in emerging fields of science. Scientific collaboration is defined as co-authorship based on new scientific or technical knowledge. I postulate that two dimensions of scientific collaboration, intensity and heterogeneity, will facilitate establishment of technological systems. These arguments are tested empirically in a new population of technological systems linked by nano-science and nanotechnology between 1959 and 2004. Findings support the arguments, and the role of scientific collaboration in the emergence of technological systems is discussed."
2015,"A Network Filter for Social Learning: Evidence from Equity Research When are decision makers able to learn from others? I argue that actors occupying network positions that enable social learning gain a competitive advantage. I show that the accuracy of security analysts earnings forecasts improves when the coverage network readily conveys information about competitors decision-making context. The benefits of social learning are most pronounced in unstable environments, measured by firms forecast dispersion. This article contributes to organizational theory by specifying network positions providing a superior view of competitors information environment and to strategy research by identifying conditions under which these positions confer a competitive advantage."
2015,"A Process of Collective Bricolage: Crafting Highly Diffusable Innovations in High Uncertainty Highly diffusable innovations create value across several domains and contribute to the creation of new markets and the disruption of existing industries. For this reason, they are particularly interesting objects of study for innovation management. This research investigates the creation of highly diffusable innovations in the contexts of the high uncertainty and open-endedness that prevails in most open innovation activities. Open innovation structures are proliferating, yet we still have only a rudimentary understanding of their ability to generate highly diffusible innovations. Through the analytical lens of collective bricolage, we examine how collective bricolage unfolds in open innovation and how it contributes to the creation of highly diffusable innovation. Our analysis builds on an in- depth empirical study of open innovation competitions in the semiconductor industry. The innovation contests provided a temporary open-ended structure that transformed individual participants into temporary team members who collectively explored opportunities for developing highly diffusable innovations. Based on an analysis of three generic technology innovation contests, we define a collective bricolage process for open-ended innovation consisting of four steps: a) pre-conditions, b) the repertoire, c) clustering, and d) prototyping. This model deepens our understanding of how collective bricolage, when undertaken in open innovation structures, produces highly diffusable innovations. This insight advances the literature on open innovation and, more generally, contributes to the field of innovation management."
2015,"The Creativity of Organizations in Taking CSR: Handling Conflicting Institutional Demands It is a challenge for companies to simultaneously follow corporate social responsibility (CSR) and the profit maximization premise as principles guiding their activities (Aguilera, Rupp, Williams, & Ganapathi, 2007; Hahn, Preuss, Pinkse, & Figge, 2014; Margolis & Walsh, 2003). Handling conflicting demands is a topic of increasing interest in institutional literature (Greenwood, Raynard, Kodeih, Micelotta, & Lounsbury, 2011; Hallett, 2010; Meyer & Rowan, 1977; Pache & Santos, 2010; Reay & Hinings, 2005). However, there is little research on corporate reactions in facing this challenge. We use the case of CSR implementation to develop a model of the organizational implementation and handling of emerging conflicting institutional demands. We build on and differentiate between the well- established theoretical concepts of isomorphism, translation, and decoupling on different implementation levels. We argue that it is necessary to distinguish between a rhetorical and a structural handling. Although not all kinds of handling completely resolve the tensions between conflicting institutional demands, they at least reduce specific tensions. Additionally, we show that companies are able to adopt conflicting ideas in daily routines without conflicts becoming virulent at the level of daily practices. Companies apply a strategy that creates tolerance for ambivalence."
2015,"The Benefits of Ambiguity: The Emergence of the Organizational Category of Social Entrepreneurship Organizational sociologists are reaching consensus that the path towards societal change often passes through the emergence of new organizational categories with initially ambiguous and contested boundaries. Nevertheless, ambiguity is treated as a temporary condition that recedes once contestation is resolved in favor of one emerging category with clear boundaries and a dominant definition. Our study of the emergence of the category of social entrepreneurship challenges the assumption that one category variant will become dominant over time. Instead, it offers insights into the conditions and processes that enable ambiguous organizational categories, which accommodate multiple category variants and embody the expectations of multiple audiences, to emerge and persist over time. Our proposed model highlights how fragmentation and new opportunities across fields give rise to multiple category variants that enjoy varying degrees of moral, cognitive and pragmatic legitimacy. In the absence of one variant that is superior across these dimensions, and in the presence of multiple key audiences with substantial power and resources, an ambiguous category can emerge which envelops divergent variants. In juxtaposition to views of ambiguous categories as temporary and vulnerable, our model explains the emergence and persistence of such categories in order to refine theory on the emergence of new categories."
2015,"Taking Stock of the Stakeholder Salience Tradition: Renewing the Research Agenda Mitchell et al.s (1997) stakeholder salience theory is one of the most prominent contributions to the management literature. Although the stakeholder salience theory is a powerful tool to identify and prioritize stakeholders and is one of the most frequently cited works, efforts to take stock of research in the stakeholder salience tradition have remained limited. In this paper, therefore, the authors conducted a systematic review of articles on stakeholder theory and stakeholder salience and identified 121 relevant research articles. The review shows that following Mitchell et al.s (1997) original model, the concept of stakeholder salience has evolved remarkably and is being applied in various fields. The authors consolidated and synthesized the existing contributions into three mutually discernible themes: assessment of the salience framework, the refinement and development of the model and the integration of contextual factors. This study provides an organized map to scholars in the stakeholder salience tradition, identifies the gaps that still exist in the literature and offers possible avenues for future research."
2015,"Children Without Bruised Knees: Responding to Material and Ideational (Mis)alignments  Institutional theorists have predominantly focused on the symbolic and cognitive side of institutions. However, material objects such as buildings, fashion, technologies, or artifacts, also embody institutions or transfer institutions in defining the repertoire of responses available to actors when they are confronted with new institutional requirements. So far, this role of materiality has been largely overlooked in institutional studies. Material aspects of organizing can nevertheless critically shape actors responses to institutional pressures, not in the least because material and ideational aspects are often intermingled. In this paper we will show how a new coercive pressure in the Dutch childcare field had an impact on material and ideational aspects of childcare organizations. We will show how childcare decision makers compared the material and ideational aspects of the new requirements with their existing material and ideational situation. The perceived degree of (mis)alignment subsequently shaped their evaluation of the consequences of (non)conformity and the breadth of responses available to them."
2015,"Reams from My Father: Webers Legacy for Organization Theory At his untimely death in 1920, Max Weberwidely recognized as the father of organization theoryleft behind reams of manuscript pages that were assembled into Economy & Society. This paper argues that early translations and interpretations of these writings led to distorted understandings of Webers work by his direct academic descendants in organization theory. Based on improved understandings that Weberian specialists have offered, we suggest ways that his ideas on social action, rationality, and legitimacy can inform and redirect contemporary institutional analysis. Specific propositions deducible from Webers theorizing are contrasted with those of researchers in his intellectual lineage. [Sadly, the first author of this manuscript, Richard Weiss, passed away last year. The paper was completed, and will be presented by, his spouse, the second author.]"
2015,"The Cognitive Grounding of Institutions and Words in New Institutionalism New institutionalism has been termed new due to its cognitive turn. However, cognition as a core element of the theory has rarely been elaborated intensively. This becomes obvious by recognizing that the claim, which depicts words as carriers and activators of cognitively shared institutions, has no theoretical fundament in earlier studies. In this paper, we approach this central problem of new institutionalism by examining the relationship between institutions, cognition, and words by using findings of research streams in cognitive science. We illustrate how institutions are governed by cognition. We also demonstrate how institutions are encapsulated in words and how words are able to (re)activate institutional meaning and behavior. We provide several contributions. First, we provide a starting point for a cognitive micro-foundation of new institutionalism. Second, we illustrate that the individual actor does not pose a problem for new institutionalism but rather is the explanation for both institutional stability and change. Third, we illustrate one possible way to focus more directly on institutions as cognitive structures. This enables not only the investigation of institutional change but also an analysis of the content and stability of institutions. We thereby lay the foundation for new and linguistically oriented research in new institutionalism."
2015,"Disentangling Legitimacy: Towards A Taxonomy Of Legitimacy States In this paper, we advance the understanding of legitimacy by exploring the different states of legitimacy that could typify an actor at a given moment in time and the conclusions that can be drawn from that state that will guide the process to enhance or sustain legitimacy in the eyes of evaluators. We extend theory by 1) drawing attention to the presence of intermediate states of legitimacy and challenge the implicit notion of legitimacy as a dichotomous variable, 2) clarifying the notions of the object and the state of legitimacy, and 3) proposing a taxonomy of legitimacy states. We apply this taxonomy to a hypothetical data set and review a series of conceivable judgment distributions. In doing so, we identify two alternative states of legitimacy: polarized legitimacy and uniform distributed judgments. We finish this paper with a series of conclusions, discuss their implications for theory and practice and suggest avenues for further research."
2015,"Prometheus Bound: Establishing Boundaries for the Construct of Institutional Entrepreneurship This paper specifies boundary limits for the construct of institutional entrepreneurship in order to increase the precision of the construct. The bounding operation focuses on attributes that an individual must possess to be legitimately labeled an institutional entrepreneur. In delineating these attributes, we also provide the basis for novel theory about how the attributes determine the actions of institutional entrepreneurs. This theoretical logic is distilled into a number of propositions suitable for testing in future empirical research. We believe that the result of such research would be a better understanding of the cognition and the behavior of the individual institutional entrepreneur. Therefore our bounding operation actually unbinds institutional entrepreneurship to be a better progenitor of insightful theory."
2015,"Opening Governance to Co-designed Co-determination  for Economic Democracy We explore governance in relation to five meanings of open: (1) by exploring co-determination under German law (Mitbestimmung) and by analysing the method of design thinking with its emphasis on empathy to the user experience, we investigate open as more democratically shared power, information and responsibility ; (2) in using the genealogical method of historical investigation we express open as exposing something that is covered; (3) by initiating this discussion with the academic community, we invite frank open discussion; (4) in not positing a final thesis, we leave the conclusion unsettled and open for further debate and analysis; (5) yet, we do hope this discussion will lead to new approaches to governance, thereby establishing or opening co-designed open governance as a new enterprise."
2015,"Lost in Translation? Independent Directors Reinterpreted by NYSE Listed Chinese Companies Prior studies on independent directorship focused on one particular corporate governance culture, i.e. Anglo-American, thus paid less research attention to how companies in other governance cultures may espouse different conceptions of independent directorship and reinterpret it as needed. This study draws on cultural sociology literature to propose cultural embeddedness and agency as two distinct mechanisms underlying different interpretations of independent directorship by the Chinese companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Embeddedness of the Chinese companies in the relational network at the local market and the cultural schemas emphasizing more collectivism makes them to uphold more Chinese concept of outside directors as resource providers. Cultural agency fostered by greater exposure to Anglo-American governance practices through directors board interlock or educational background allows the companies to emphasize more monitoring capabilities that are consistent with the Anglo-American conception of the independent directorship. Reinterpretation of the independent directorship, however, is found to require alignment of cultural embeddedness and agency - independent directors for companies with higher level of cultural embeddedness attract more financial investment when they are described more in terms of resource providing capacity. The papers contributions to the studies of institutionalism, symbolic management, and corporate governance are discussed."
2015,"The Long Hand of State: The Structure of State-Led Business Groups and Performance Implications In this study we trace the identity of major shareholders of Chinas listed firms and group them into business groups led by state asset management agencies at various levels. We argue that the objectives and motivations of the controlling state entities, the governance structure, and composition of the groups have strong influence on member firms financial performance. Using 2004-2012 panel data on firms listed on Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchange, we find that controlling state agencies political status is positively associated with firms market value as measured by Tobins Q, but negatively associated with firms profitability as measured by ROA. Firms performance will be weaker in groups with more internal hierarchies. Moreover, we find that the group diversification is negatively associated with firms performance and this effect is stronger in places with more advanced market supporting institutions. In addition, the presence of non-state members in a group is beneficial to the financial performance of both state and non-state members."
2015,"Too Ambitious To Survive: The Effects of Business and Political Ties on Firms Survival Although the advantages of a brokers position within a network are well understood, there is little research on the risks associated with managing different sets of relationships simultaneously. This could happen, for example, when a broker firm has two different kinds of tiesties to other firms and ties to government. Each of these relationships may be valuable in isolation, yet taken together they can constrain each other because a broker firm needs to manage divergent and even conflicting demands from these partners. I examine how Korean conglomerates fared when their owner families simultaneously maintained marriage ties to families in the fellow conglomerate and marriage ties to government officials. I find that when conglomerates maintained both types of marriage ties simultaneously, their failure rate was higher than when they had marriages either to other conglomerates or to the government officials."
2015,"A New Order of Things: Network Change and Field Transformation Following an Exogenous Shock In this article we examine network dynamics by focusing on specific mechanisms that drive tie creation and dissolution: i) assortativity which ascribes tie formation to the similarity of attributes of firms, ii) transitivity which indicates a tendency of triads toward closure and iii) preferential attachment which indicates the tendency of actors that already have many connections to attract additional ties. We provide an explanation of network change that goes beyond network endogeneity by incorporating exogenous shocks in our analysis. To estimate the changes in the mechanisms of affiliation we employ a stochastic actor-oriented model. Our findings indicate that exogenous shocks can exert significant influence on a fields social structure and should be thus given more relevance when we examine how networks evolve over time."
2015,"Explaining Network Transformation in British and Italian Motorsport A great deal of research has investigated the structural properties of networks and how these are central in explaining knowledge transfer and innovation. However, much less is known about how networks evolve and transform themselves over time and the extent to which these dynamic processes affect knowledge flows and collaboration patterns. Using longitudinal data on the British and Italian motorsport industries, this paper examines the dynamics of networks through a comparative analysis of the histories, industry contexts and lead firm strategies to explain network formation and subsequent development. It finds that the two countries vary historically in terms of structure, resources and technology and that these differences have influenced the strategic actions of key actors. The consequent transformations of networks are distinctive in terms of membership, logics of attachment and forms of collaboration. The trajectories of network development in the British and Italian motorsport industries emphasize how agency and strategic action are moderated by the historical context and that network transformation is both by degrees emergent and managed."
2015,"Understanding Latecomer Strategy from a Business Ecosystem Perspective Latecomer strategy has been well understood by academics in 1990s. Many scholars emphasised the technology catching-up approach for latecomer strategy. However, the rise of Xiaomi, a four-year-old smartphone manufactures provides a case that cannot be well explained by previous theories. We conducted a single case study on Xiaomi through in-depth semi-structured interviews. This case study reveals a new approach, driven by market, to realising catch up, which should be preferred and sustainable in certain contexts. By incorporating the business ecosystems concept, our analysis syntheses both catch-up approaches in a comprehensive framework. Meanwhile, the introduction of business ecosystem extends our understanding on latecomer strategy through a dynamic and feedback process that also advances our knowledge on business ecosystem dynamics. Theoretical propositions and practical implications are also included."
2015,"Pay Attention: Object Consideration as a Mechanism of Network Diffusion Research on diffusion processes in networks relies on two broad classes of mechanisms: networks direct the flow of information, and they produce constraints for rational decision-making. This paper highlights a limitation of such work by arguing that networks provide a normative constraint on behavior as well. Social influence determines not only what options are known about or are beneficial, but what options enter the consideration of an agent. I identify this effect by taking advantage of data on a foreign exchange trading platform with an integrated social network. Features of the foreign exchange market exclude informational and strategic explanations of diffusion processes. Nevertheless members of the platform adopt each others trading behavior, and do so most for behaviors that are least normative within the community, suggesting that the network generates learning or adaptation over norms. Because such learning can take place even after initial diffusion of information and independently of changes to strategic equilibria, I argue that this is a particularly important mechanism in accounting for long-term patterns of diffusion."
2015,"The Efficiency Paradox in Organization and Management Theory We theoretically discuss a phenomenon that we label efficiencyism. Efficiencyism describes a fixation on reified tenets of efficiency without questioning its assumptions and consequences. In organization and management theory efficiency is a foundational concept, which is assumed to be vital for economic success based on the optimization of input-output ratios. Based on the logic of the Jevons Paradox, a concept originating from resource and environmental economics, we challenge the assumptions underlying the notion of efficiency and argue that presumably efficient processes or behaviours can in many cases lead to inefficient outcomes. These rebound effects can be observed in a broad array of organizational and managerial contexts. Despite their oftentimes unintended and counterintuitive effects, rebound effects and efficiencyism more generally however persist in theory and practice. To explain why this is the case, we develop three enabling conditions of efficiencyism, namely interpretive flexibility, the maximization imperative, and the micro-macro gap. Our framework has theoretical and empirical implications for seeing efficiency in organization and management theory in a new light."
2015,"Organizational Effectiveness: Replacing a Vague Construct with a Defined Concept The paper offers a new theory of organizational effectiveness (OE) based on an outcome-focused model (OFM) in which the goal of every organization is the same, that is, to be effective. The OFM equates effectiveness with the achievement of expected external outcomes (EEOs) within defined causal chains that link supply-side inputs and outputs to demand-side outcomes and impacts. While scholars have long categorized organizational effectiveness as a vague construct due to its lack of an objective referent, the EEOs of the OFM provide such a referent within a bounded concept space. The new model shares features with open-system contingency models of the past, but draws on traditions in other fields (quality management and results-based management) to define a new concept of effectiveness. Within the OFM, organizations achieve effectiveness through an outcome-focused strategy. Effectiveness provides all that an organization needs to survive and prosper. An outcome-focused organization understands, serves, and enhances its environment, and is rewarded in return, while effectiveness confers solid ground on which to stand when facing present and future challenges."
2015,"Facing and Making the Future: Organizational Foresight and Strategic Choices Most scholars would agree that our understanding of organizational foresight remains inadequate, both as a conceptual construct and in terms of its relevance to managerial practice. We define organizational foresight (OrgF) as the organizational capability for comprehending the emergent organizational future. In this paper, we develop a framework of OrgF that is centrally concerned with how organizations engage with the future. The nature of this engagement is constituted jointly by two distinct temporal dimensions of the organization, namely, Future Attitude and Future Orientation. Whereas Future Orientation(Near and Distant) is generally recognized in the strategic decision making literature, it is necessary to discuss the other temporal dimension. We have termed this second dimension as Future Attitude, which is the basic way organizational decision makers perceive the flow of time in the future time segment, either passively in terms of anticipation (facing the future) or actively as an arena to accomplish something (making the future). Thus, we propose that OrgF is comprised of the two temporal dimensions of Future Attitude (Passive and Active) and Future Orientation (Near and Distant). Based on this two-dimensional conception, we present a four- part framework of OrgF. We also discuss the implications of the different types of OrgF for understanding the dynamics of strategic choice."
2015,"Dynamics and Evaluation of Organizational Style: From Practice to Category The concept of style occupies a paradoxical position in management and strategy research. While it has been used fruitfully in exploring topics such as leadership or the impact of managers idiosyncrasies on organizations performance, it has neither been defined nor thoroughly operationalized. This paper examines the potential of the concept of style for the study of organizations and their strategies. Drawing insights from related disciplines, and relying on a comparison with cognate concepts, it defines style as non-exclusive identifiable and durable pattern of action and choice that is open to stochastic change and hybridization. Style can be seen as an enactment of categories that enables the interpretation of practices. The evaluation of organizational stylistic affiliations by market insiders and outsiders is then explored."
2015,"Reputation for Quality or Prominence: What Matters More  and Why? There is broad consensus in the strategic management and organization studies literature that reputation has a positive effect on performance. An unsettled question is how reputation exerts its influence. The literature suggests two different primary pathways. The first is based on mechanisms of economic organization, including transaction costs economics and the resource-based view of the firm, while the second is based on social construction processes. We use meta-analysis to integrate the accumulated evidence and also structural equation modeling to compare the theorized pathways for reputation effects. Our results indicate that reputation effects are stronger via the pathway suggested by social construction theory (i.e., prominence) rather than the economic organization route (i.e., quality), although both mechanisms are significant determinants of subsequent accounting performance. Surprisingly the effects of social construction mechanisms on stock market performance are not significant."
2015,"Examining How a Firm's Multiple Reputations Influence Reactions to a Negative Violation We examine how a firms multiple reputations influence managers and stakeholders reactions to a negative violation. Specifically, we investigate how a firms financial and social reputations, as well as its overall general reputation, serve potentially conflicting roles for two types of organizational violations: financial restatements and environmental malfeasance. In the context of financial restatements, we find that a firms social reputation encourages managers to provide a more accommodative response to the violation, while its general reputation discourages managers from being accommodative. We also find that being accommodative positively influences each of a firms three reputations as outcomes in a financial violation context. In the context of environmental malfeasance, we find that a firms social and financial reputations encourage managers to provide an accommodative response, while its general reputation discourages managers from being accommodative. We also find that being accommodative negatively influences a firms social and general reputations as outcomes in the social violation context. Ultimately, we show that reputation repair is a complex and dynamic process and that a firms multiple reputations often act in conflicting rather than complementary ways. In doing so, we advance organizational research in several related areas, including reputation management, stakeholder management, and social evaluations."
2015,"Examining How Product and Corporate Reputation Impacts Political Responses to Product Ratings This study examines how reputation predicts firm responses to product ratings. Longitudinal examination of nine automobile manufacturers during National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration (NHTSA) crash tests reveals several important findings regarding how reputation is associated with firm responses to product ratings. In particular, high reputation firms implement fewer political responses to ratings declines of high- reputation products while implementing more political responses to ratings declines of low-reputation products. Results suggest that reputation at both the product and firm-levels interact to predict how firms respond to reputation-damaging events such as declining product-safety ratings."
2015,"The Weakness of Sanctioning in Norms-Based Property Systems: An Investigation of Joke Theft This paper investigates practices and patterns of sanctioning violations of exclusivity in norms-based intellectual property systems through a study of joke theft allegations in stand-up comedy. These informal, network-based institutions emerge to define and police property rights in domains where formal legal interventions are absent and, in their place, social norms define exclusivity and guide the adjudication of rights violations. This study finds that, while these regimes are effective in discouraging free-riding, they tend to be ineffective regarding the sanctioning of those that transgress property rights norms for three main reasons. First, making allegations of malfeasance can be costly because of risks of reputational damage and retribution from accused parties, especially if they are socially central, that may lead to penalties regarding career advancement. This discourages policing even in cases where a transgressors actions are shared knowledge within the community. Second, it requires accusers to undertake complex strategies of moral entrepreneurship and to possess higher peer esteem and enhanced reputations for norm conformity vis--vis their targets. Lastly, opportunities emerge where accusations of plagiarism are decoupled from an act, because allegations can allow for opportunism and can present means of rationalizing discontinuities between status orders, particularly commercial success and peer esteem. These findings emerge from a qualitative study of the stand-up comedy in Los Angeles, which involves data from five years participant observation research of the industry, semi-structured interviews, and archival research of stand-up comedy podcasts."
2015,"Variations and Antecedents of Ceremonial Conformity as a Response to Institutional Pressure The current paper focuses on ceremonial conformity, the inconsistency between what is done and what is claimed by organizations, as a form of organizational agency toward unwelcome institutional pressure. By extending the dichotomous and unidimensional conceptualization of decoupling, the current paper aims to identify and consider numerous ways of separating institutionally required organizational actions from the actual operations. As the ways that organizations adjust the degree of conformity to institutional pressures, the current paper uses two practice variation dimensions suggested by Ansari, Fiss, and Zajac (2010), namely fidelity and extensiveness. This paper argues that these two dimensions are predicted by a motivational factor (compliance cost) and constraints (ambiguity and murkiness), which are inherent in the practice characteristics. Furthermore, the asymmetric effects of ambiguity and murkiness on the adjustment of fidelity and extensiveness are theorized. This paper can contribute to institutional theory by illuminating the qualitative differences and variations of decoupling, thereby contributing to an enhanced and nuanced understanding of strategic responses of organizations facing unwelcome institutional pressures."
2015,"Compliance or Defiance: Firm Responses to Regulation Related to Performance We aim to contribute to the institutional fit literature by investigating the relationship between regulatory institutional fit and firm performance. We offer a framework that allows for further analysis of what constitutes lack of (institutional) fit. We distinguish two categories of lack of fit and explain the difference between their occurrences. Firms can either deviate by keeping lower internal regulatory standards compared to what is externally enforced (underregulation) or conversely by enforcing more stringent regulations than their industry prescribes (overregulation). In order to create a continuous scale of regulatory fit, the latter is termed negative underregulation. We hypothesize that there is a U-shaped relationship between the level of underregulation and substantive performance such that firms that either overregulate or underregulate perform better than firms that operate at regulatory fit. Using survey data from 550 Dutch companies we indeed find that the two types of lack of regulatory fit are related to higher relative substantive performance than regulatory fit. Our results suggest that succumbing to regulatory institutional pressures may not be the best strategy to attain maximum performance. Firm regulatory structures may be most beneficial to a company when based on firm- specific requirements rather than on the industry standard."
2015,"Decoupling Corporate Governance Adoption From Implementation: The Effect of Managerial Attitudes In this paper, we explore the decoupling of corporate governance formal policies adoption from actual implementation by investigating the relationship between corporate governance de-jure and corporate governance de-facto. We deem this distinction necessary because not all firms implement in practice the corporate governance policies they claim they adopt. Our findings indicate that the degree of compliance with corporate governance prescriptions, i.e., corporate governance de-jure, claimed in the corporate governance annual statements, is not a sine qua non condition for effective corporate governance, which we refer to as corporate governance de-facto. Moreover, we show that positive managerial attitudes to corporate governance, i.e., when executives are positively predisposed towards corporate governance, mean firms are more likely to apply the spirit, not only the letter, of their corporate governance policies. The results have important theoretical implications as they demonstrate the usefulness of institutional theory for the study of the variation in corporate governance practices."
2015,"Decoupling Under Pressure Changes in organizations' performance evaluations place greater pressure on decoupled organizations to sustain myths of improvement based on ceremonial criteria of worth. I develop hierarchical and relational models to explain the variability in reported performance metrics among schools in California's public school system over the period 1999-2012, during which the state facilitated the entry of charter schools as an alternative organizational form and introduced standardized test metrics to evaluate schools' technical performance. My findings suggest that organizations maintain legitimacy under increased performance pressure by decoupling to demonstrate technical competence at higher levels of the organization while exposing lower levels to increased risk of failure. While the entry of charter schools in some districts contributed to increases in districts' reported effectiveness and efficiency in terms of the new performance criteria, it also contributed to decreases in the enrollment and performance of district public schools proximate to charter schools."
2015,"Individual Implications of Institutional Pluralism: Actors Shifting Between Institutional Logics Institutional pluralism describes situations, where multiple institutional spheres confront legitimacy-seeking (organizational and individual) actors with competing demands. However, the emerging field of research on individual responses to institutional pluralism lacks the differentiated discussion of legitimacy considerations that has been at the heart of earlier institutional research. In this paper we argue that a systematic account of individual responses requires a better understanding of how institutional pluralism is linked to individuals agency and legitimacy in organizational settings. We develop a framework that explores these linkages. Following this framework, we suggest that shifting between institutional logics is a crucial response in modern pluralist settings, where various logics are equally available to individuals. We differentiate between three different types of shifts and discuss their implications on individuals legitimacy. Drawing on our framework, we review recent empirical studies on individuals logic shifts in order to identify neglected areas in the field and to outline areas where we see potential for further research on individual responses to institutional pluralism."
2015,"Individual Responses to Competing Institutional Logics In this paper we study individual responses to competing institutional logics of market and community. We argue that when individuals experience strong pressures both from market and community logics, in their responses they are likely to combine both logics rather than comply with one of the two."
2015,"'Keeping it Weird: How Anchoring Sustains Hybrid Organizing from the Ground While much research has focused on how institutional complexity can be managed at the organizational level, we know less about how individuals experience and cope with conflicting institutional prescriptions. To examine how individuals balance multiple logics as an ongoing accomplishment, we conducted an in-depth case study at a leading Benefit Corporation in the U.S.  a newly emerging hybrid form that incorporates a social welfare and commercial logic at its core. We find that not every organizational member experienced complexity to the same degree, and that individuals caught between conflicting institutional prescriptions coped by means of anchoring. Anchoring served to mitigate the discomfort experienced from having to satisfy competing demands, safeguard against drift toward either alternative and sustain bottom-up hybrid organizing. We contribute by shifting conversations from how hybridity and conflicting pressures need to be managed or overcome towards hybridity as an ongoing juggling act over time."
2015,"Florence Nightingales and Assembly Lines: Understanding Responses to Institutional Complexity Despite an increasing focus on micro-level responses to institutional complexity, knowledge about how different institutional logics are enacted in day-to-day practices is limited, as is our understanding of how differences between responses are resolved. We aim to advance our understanding by studying how members of hierarchically related occupational groups within organizations articulate and enact different institutional logics in their day-to-day practices, and how we can understand the association of their respective responses. We draw on in-depth interviews with 10 executive managers, 11 middle managers and 28 nurses from six home-care organizations that are embedded in a setting with a managerial logic, a professional care logic, and a relatively new community logic. We contribute to research on institutional logics by making explicit how occupational groups manage to circumvent conflict, despite enacting different responses. The reflexive skills of executive and middle managers, who primarily articulate to the managerial logic, enables them to anticipate nurses response and provide some leverage. Nurses were knowledgeable of the practical translation of multiple logics, and were rather skillful in manipulatively keeping up administrative consistency, suggesting that their practices took place within the purview of the managerial logic, and within the boundaries set by superiors."
2015,"Rituals of Control: Creating and Living under a Budget Number In this paper we explore budgeting as a process through which people annually create and defend their own instrument of control -- the budget number. In so doing, we articulate the role of ritual in shaping the relationship between the individuals creating the number and the evolution of the number itself. Using qualitative data from a hotel management firm, we trace how engaging in the budgeting process affects how people orient to numbers first as subjective assessments, then to entities with objective, reified, and eventually governing status. Further, we argue that the ritualistic process of budgeting enlists individuals in creating their own instrument of control and creates organizational stability. As such, it serves to align individual efforts in service of the organization while maintaining faith in the system. This work has implications for our understanding of rituals of control whereby control is maintained and even re-affirmed even as the numbers themselves change annually."
2015,"Calculative Devices as Boundary Objects in an Acquisition Discourse This paper explores the role of calculative devices as boundary objects. Boundary objects facilitate the flow of information, communication and negotiation between different groups of actors. Previous research has identified commonality and plasticity as two requirements for boundary objects. This paper identifies a third criterion for boundary objects  legitimacy. Our analysis of calculative devices shows that objects will only be able to function as boundary objects if they have legitimacy in the interwoven network of practices and discourses that encompasses the relevant groups of actors. This study further shows that calculative devices enact their role as boundary objects in three stages : identification, calculation, and objectification. Progression through these stages provides calculative devices a taken-for-grantedness that makes it increasingly difficult to question the calculative logic embedded in the device."
2015,"Markers, Maps and Metrics: Moving Beyond the Numbers and Aligning Activities through Budgets Recent contributions to coordinating theory emphasize the emergent nature of coordinating mechanisms in practice. While scholars have highlighted the dynamic and social nature of coordinating mechanisms, the focus on human agency overlooks the complex calculative infrastructure that permeates organizational life and is closely connected to conceptions of accountability. This paper argues that day-to-day activities are shaped by resource allocations and performance targets that are conveyed through budgets. Drawing on the insights from an 82-day ethnography study of a dramatic television series production as it unfolded in real-time, we show how the budget is an important coordinating mechanism in practice. The main contribution is a two-stage model that pulls the budget out from the shadows of other organizational processes to reveal the multifaceted ways in which actors use the budget to identify and aligned their interdependent activities."
2015,"Playing the Game at Multiple Levels A key insight in the institutional logics approach is that social systems operate at multiple and nested levels coupled by mutual processes of framing and innovation. In our paper we propose an integrated analysis of the cross-level interactions that occur in the organizational responses to pluralism. Specifically, we focus on the coupling between three interdependent processes, which extant literature in institutional theory mostly treated as separated. First, we refer to the rhetorical strategies whereby an organization reinterprets prescriptions from multiple logics to achieve external legitimacy while smoothing internal tensions. Second, we deal with the framing of individual actors responses by organizational-level structures. Third, we discuss the negotiation of local solutions at the level of individual practices. We address this theoretical issue through an in-depth case study about the allocation of financial resources (budgeting) in a large European public university."
2015,"The Impact of Environmental Change on Failure Rates of California Early Child Care Centers There is broad concern across multiple literatures, including organizational theory, economic sociology, and strategy, in how changing environmental conditions impact organizations. Typically, environmental change is modeled in a broad fashion, as researchers focus on periods of sweeping change in the political, regulatory, technological, or normative structure undergirding a market. In contrast, little focus has been devoted to the impact of incremental or continuous environmental change on organizational failure rates. In this study, I examine whether failure rates systematically increase as the rate of incremental change increases, and whether organizations with different niche strategies are differentially impacted by incremental change. I test my hypotheses using data on licensed early child care centers in California, 1996-2012."
2015,"The Price of Legitimacy: Regulation, Risk and Uncertainty in Legal Marijuana Markets Sociologists have challenged economic approaches to price on macro and micro-levels, taking issue with economists focus on the invisible hand that brings supply and demand together and the probabilistic rationality that allows actors to weigh risk and reward. Yet few sociologists have offered an alternative, sociological explanation of price and price dispersion. In this paper, we adjudicate between economic and sociological approaches to risk, uncertainty, and price and put forward a novel explanation for price dispersion by examining the nascent state-legal marijuana markets in the United States. We find that supply and demand matter, as more competitive markets have lower prices and less price dispersion than less competitive markets. But we also find that legitimacy matters more than risk, as more legitimate markets have higher prices and more price dispersion than less legitimate markets."
2015,"Little Fish in a Big Pond: Resource Partitioning, Secondary Identities, and Specialist Competition How do specialist organizations compete and secure future growth? Resource partitioning theory suggests specialist organizations occupy a unique niche or resource space established through the development of a shared organizational identity. While extant literature highlights the process underlying the partitioning of the resource space, less is known about how specialist organizations compete moving forward. Building on recent work within organization theory we propose and test a model of specialist growth. Utilizing data from 50 distinct U.S. regional markets, and 315 firms over 11 years within the micro- brew industry, we find evidence that specialist organizations are increasingly re-entering the generalist space, suggesting a de- partitioning or blurring of traditional resource spaces. As predicted, the density of specialist firms within a given market predicts patterns of growth as specialists enter and compete in the generalist market. Moreover, two secondary identities are found to reliably impact firm growth  a local identity (i.e., specialists operating in their home market), and a product proliferation identity (i.e., specialists offering an increased diversity of products). The identification of how specialist organizations compete within the generalist space provides additional insights into the evolution of specialists industries and extends current understanding of resource partitioning theory."
2015,Evolution of Vertically Related Industry Populations: The Case of the German Piano Industry Research on the evolution of industries so far had devoted little attention to the vertical structure of companies along an industrys value chain and the change of this structure over time. This study builds on previous research about industrial life cycles and theoretical concepts dealing with the vertical boundaries of firms and develops a model of the evolution of vertically related populations in an industry. It is argued that disintegration incentives within an industry increase over time basically due to a reduction of uncertainty but that the necessary conditions for vertical disintegration to take place will only be met around the emergence of a dominant design. A case study of the evolution of the German piano industry including detailed quantitative demographic data on all known firms is in line with the models predictions. Piano manufacturers were integrated firms in early phases of the industry and a considerable emergence of suppliers only set in with the occurrence of the dominant design. The study contributes to the existing literature by developing a holistic theoretical model of the evolution of industries allowing for important conclusions on the relation between technological development and vertical differentiation with profound strategic implications.
2015,"Resourcing Routine Change: How Resources Contribute to the Evolution of Routines So far, researchers studying the internal dynamics of organizational routines have paid little attention to resources, despite their central role in organization theory. Drawing on resourcing theory, this paper argues that resources are an essential part both of the ostensive and the performative aspect of routines. Analyzing data on two routines from an ethnographic study at a start-up company, we investigate how resources, and the way they interact with schemas and actions, influence routine dynamics. Our analysis shows that changes in resources trigger variations in routine performances (i.e., in the performative aspect of routines) and resourcing, i.e., creating new or drawing on existing resources to enact schemas, allows actors to accomplish these variations and to enact some of them repetitively, until they eventually become part of the ostensive aspect. We identify different patterns of resourcing within and across routines that we theorize as evolutionary processes of variation and selective retention. Thus, our study extends the existing evolutionary model of routine change by illuminating why and how actors generate variations and how they selectively retain some variations in the ostensive aspect of routines. Furthermore, these findings shed light on how artifacts and the embeddedness of routines contribute to routine change."
2015,"Resist or Comply: The Power Dynamics of Organisational Routines During Merger Extant routine literature mainly examines the endogenous change and stabilisation of routines and the responses of organisational routines to organisational change and the power dynamic behind those changes are less explored. Employing Bourdieus theory of practice, we analyse how power dynamics affect the development of organisational routines, once external change is introduced. Drawing on an in-depth qualitative case study of a merger between two academic institutions (Edinburgh College of Art and the University of Edinburgh), we argue that routines responses to organisational change depend on (a) the field within which the routine operates and (b) the actors symbolic capital and position taking during change implementation. Our findings contribute to both scholarly work in routine research and change management."
2015,"Might it be Good to Feel Bad? A Study on the Influence of Negative Emotions on Routine Development This study explores the role of emotions in routine development. We use the Cohen and Bacdayan (1994) card game to investigate the effect of discrete negative emotions (fear and sadness) on routine development in a laboratory experiment. Our findings shed light on the causal influence of fear and sadness on routine development and allow for more fine- grained conclusions regarding the role of negative emotions in routine development and thus in organizational change. Specifically, we find that both sadness and fear go in line with higher degrees of routinization when compared to a control condition. We observe that both kinds of negative emotions result in a higher reliance on specific repeated action sequences. At the same time, we find differences between the effects of sadness and fear on organizational behavior. Whereas sadness relates to quicker moves and higher performance, fear relates to a higher degree of reliability. Our findings thus not only reveal that fear and sadness differ in their impact on routine development but also that these discrete negative emotions may at least partly be beneficial rather than harmful for the routine-development process."
2015,"Anti-Routines: The Paradoxical Symbiosis of Routines and Play Behavior Routines entail trade-offs which produce both beneficial outcomes and negative byproducts in terms of actions, psychological resources, social roles, and power relations. Negative byproducts are usually perceived as the necessary evils of an otherwise reasonable and functional routine. Although they may be ameliorated to some extent by endogenous or exogenous processes, these negative aspects of routines can never be completely eliminated. We argue that organizations and their members may tackle the remaining negative aspects of routines by crafting anti-routines: playful patterns of interdependent actions that function as inverted or otherwise distorted morphological analogues of routines. We suggest that the deep motive behind the enactment of any anti-routine is to experience, express, or/and explore the behavioral elements that the focal routine constraints, suppresses, or ignores. Building upon anthropological perspectives on the co-existence of normative structures and anti-structures, we propose a dual-structure model of the creation, enactment, and functions of anti-routines. Our process theory of anti-routines connects the organizational routines and organizational play literatures, and opens new ways for examining the paradoxical symbiosis of routines and play behavior in organizational settings."
2015,"Clashing Fashions and Institutions: Mid-Life Uncertainty in Diffusing Organizational Techniques Organizational techniques are labels, such as Reengineering, denoting linguistic prescriptions, which organizations can implement to transform organizational inputs into organizational outputs. The theory of fashions in organizational techniques tends to explain the causes of the relative transience of certain organization techniques, whereas the theory of institutions in these techniques tends to explain the causes of other techniques relative persistence. We use both the theories of fashions and institutions together to examine whether, why, and when over five- hundred organizational techniques persisted relatively permanently or disappeared relatively transiently. We do so by examining how the forces causing fashion transience, institutional persistence, or a combination of both, would affect these techniques hazard rates of disappearance; that is, the risk that organizational techniques disappear, depending on how long they had endured. The paper concludes with a tripartite theoretical, methodological, and practical conclusion. It first points to the benefits of using theories of fashions and institutions together. Second, it highlights the advantages of a multi-innovation strategy involving the study of hundreds of diffusing innovations and their hazard rate. Third, it presents practical managerial implications of being capable of estimating the likelihood that a new organizational technique will become a short-lived fashion or will persist."
2015,"Adoption of LGBT-Friendly Policies: Social Construction, Coercion, Competition, or Learning? Herein, we develop and test a model of policy adoption that examines both competing and reinforcing forces. Succinctly written, do firms adopt LGBT-friendly policies due to social construction, coercion, competition, or learning? We find that firms respond to social constructivist, coercive, competitive and learning forces for and against adoption of LGBT-friendly work policies. In particular, we find that social construction processes within HR specialist publications, coercive forces exercised by state non-discrimination laws, and competitive forces through mimesis of industry leaders lead to adoption of LGBT-friendly policies. However, other coercive forces such as state-level anti-marriage equality constitutional amendments are associated with less friendly policies. Coercive, firm-specific shareholder resolutions and learning via exemplar firms are positively associated with change in LGBT-friendly policies."
2015,"The Consequence of Differences: How Heterogeneity in Practice Affects Diffusion process This article extends diffusion studies by introducing the concept of heterogeneity in organizational practicedefined as the differences among adopters in a group with respect to how they adapt a new practice after its adoption. Drawing upon theory on organizational learning and legitimacy, I propose, first, that heterogeneity in organizational practice increases subsequent adoption up to certain point, but its effect tapers off after that point; second, that its effect varies depending on the stage of diffusion process. In a longitudinal study of the diffusion of the executive officer system an Anglo-Saxon corporate governance practiceamong large Japanese firms from 1997 to 2013, I find that the effect of heterogeneity in organizational practice on subsequent adoption is curvilinear and inverted U-shaped, and that its effect in the early stage differs from in the late stage."
2015,"Creating the British Academic Health Science Centres: The Case of Translating Organizational Forms I drew on an in-depth longitudinal analysis of the adoption of an American organizational form, namely Academic Health Science Centre (or AHSC), in the field of the British health care from 1997 to 2009 to examine the translation process of organizational forms across institutional contexts. My finding reveals a step-wise process of translation that unfolds over three phases (activation, dormancy, and reactivation), and actions required for successful translation that occurred in each phase (contextual design of a solution, strategies for gaining support and mobilizing forces, and legitimation). The three overarching categories played out in different phases, whereby the first category was the key activities in the activation phase, the second and the third in the reactivation phase. I also found that the step-wise, dynamic process of translation operated according to the principles inherent to the garbage can model. I found that the transitions between phases were triggered by combinations of three conditions: (1) energy of dominant actors that influence attention of field audience, (2) existence of actors with motivation and capacity to translate and promote the organizational form, and (3) existence of powerful problems in the field. Based on my case study, I suggest that the translation is not a planned process as existing studies imply, but a non-linear and coincidental process, in which the temporal dimension plays a significant role. The study contributes to the literatures of the translation of organizational forms."
2015,"MNCs and Their External Constituents behind Uniform Patterns of Internationalization Previous research has been relatively insensitive to the role the shared industries might play in the materialization of country-of-origin effects in the development of MNCs. This is although groups of MNCs positioned under similar industry categories have various external constituents that pose distinctive expectations and demands. The fifteen-year period of internationalization of three major Finnish paper industry companies examined in this study enables underlines the nature of these processes as collective endeavors in which, in addition to the MNCs themselves, their external constituents play an important role. In its entirety, the present study extends the extant literature on MNCs in two senses. First, it suggests that the influence of the shared industry not only applies to timing but also to the forms and meaning given to individual foreign actions and the value of further internationalization in the first place. Second, the present study indicates that the idea of being and becoming an MNC is susceptible to continuous re-definitions brought about by the interaction between the management of the MNCs and their external constituents that unfolds as the internationalization process proceeds."
2015,"Multinational Behavior in Host Countries: The Role of Countervailing Power We examine MNC behavior in a host country using theoretical perspectives derived from both new institutional organization theory and comparative political economy. We demonstrate that these two fields generate largely contradictory predictions about the effect of country-of-origin on foreign MNC employment practices in a stable host institutional environment. We develop a theory of countervailing power that reconciles these two schools of thought: new institutional theory predicts MNC behavior when a countervailing power exists, and comparative political economy predicts MNC behavior when no countervailing power exists. We test our theory using unique firm-level administrative data on MNC downsizing practices during mass layoffs in Canada from 2004-2013, and a natural experiment inspired research design where we compare the behavior of foreign MNCs to Canadian MNCs. The results strongly support our theory as within unionized workplaces there is no country-of-origin effect, as predicted by new institutional theory, but within non-unionized workplaces, there is a striking country-of-origin effect that matches the predictions of comparative political economy."
2015,"Organizational Practice Adoption in the MNC: The Role of Managers' Core Self-Evaluations Although the adoption of organizational practices by subsidiaries is a key concern in multinational corporations (MNCs), research on the individuals involved in practice adoption is lacking. Despite calls in the MNC literature for investigations of the psychological foundations of managers behavior, such investigations are rare and have been complicated by difficulties in obtaining intimate assessments from managers. Building on personality research, we propose that subsidiary managers core self-evaluations (CSE) positively influence their practice-adoption behavior. Consistent with personality and organizational control research, we also posit that formal and informal controls play contingent roles. Our analysis of a unique dataset of individuals involved in 130 practice-adoption cases within one European MNC offers large support for our hypotheses."
2015,"Theory of Empathic Organizational Design Public sentiment for large multinational corporations (MNCs) is remarkably low. Charges have been levied that the MNC behaves like a psychopath that pursues its own self-interest with a profound lack of empathy. The prescription for pursuit of self-interest is a central tenet of the theory of the firm promoted by the neoclassical school of thinkers including Milton Friedman - a position justified with excerpts from Adam Smiths The Wealth of Nations (1776). In this article, we contend that in a modern context where large multinational corporations (MNCs) dominate the global business environment, crucial relational elements of Smiths thinking related to the role of empathy have been lost. More specifically, we argue that Smiths proverbial butcher, brewer, and baker knew their stakeholders faces, which aroused empathy that influenced the businesspersons considerations of self-interest and better aligned them with social welfare. However, employees of modern-day MNCs seldom directly interface with their many stakeholders, which diminishes the link between self-interest and social welfare. To illustrate this point, we compare an approximation of Smiths small baker, Bloedows Little Bake Shop, with a large MNC bakery, General Mills. Through this comparison, we propose that large MNCs would be well-served to design in organizational elements that enable the arousal of employee empathy. We propose that in doing so theories of management can be made more reasonable when they consider the role of empathy in conjunction with self-interest and would be more consistent with the teachings of Adam Smith."
2015,"The Paradox of Stakeholder Power in Leveraged Buyout Financing: A Multiple-Agency Perspective Previous studies have relied predominantly on agency theory to understand relationships among stakeholders (actors) involved in a leveraged buyout transaction and explain inherent characteristics of LBO debt financing. However, traditional agency theory overlooks structural characteristics like dependencies and power-differentials between principals and agents. Using a multiple-agency framework on a sample of 6,609 LBO loan tranches that were issued during the period 1986-2012, we examine how power dynamics impact contractual outcomes among LBO participants. Our analysis highlights the asymmetric nature of power among agency partners. Agency conflicts are lower when lenders (principals) have a dependence advantage over PE- sponsors (agents) and higher when the latter possess more power in the relationship."
2015,"A Structural Theory of Power, Strategy, and Performance We develop a structural theory of organization power to explain major organization decisions, strategies, and firm performance. We explain why the structural position of a firm in the resource exchange network can grant it structural power (dis)advantages over exchange partners, influencing the firms decisions to acquire, ally with, or coopt these exchange partners. In addition, we theorize that a firms structural power (dis)advantages can influence a wide range of other major decisions, including product diversification, international diversification, innovation, political activities, and executive succession. We propose that structural power advantage is a fundamental source of a firms superior performance and offer an analytical tool to empirically operationalize our key constructs and test our theoretical predictions. We discuss the contributions of our structural power theory to research on organization power and the implications of this theory for transaction cost economics, social networks, and industrial economics."
2015,"Fair and Balanced? How Resource Dependence Shapes Media Coverage In this paper, we examine how inter-organizational relationships may influence media coverage of firms. We describe the idea of media capture, in which resource dependencies between the media and corporations are associated with more positive media coverage of firms with such relationships. Drawing upon resource dependence theory, we develop a theoretical framework to explain why media coverage is affected by three resource dependenciesadvertisement expenditures, ownership, and board interlocks. We test our theory with a longitudinal analysis of 250 firms over a five-year period. We empirically find that advertisement and ownership significantly influence firm media coverage whereas board interlocks do not. This study suggests that the role of media as a social evaluator and governance mechanism may be affected somewhat by its inter- organizational resource dependency."
2015,"Stamps of Power and Conflict: Imprinting and Influence in the U.S. Senate, 1973-2009 Structural power is often assumed to lead to influence. Yet people vary in their ability to convert power into influence, and the experience of power can itself sow the seeds for the loss of influence. We bring a temporal, historical perspective to account for these disparities and apparent contradictions. We theorize that the gain or loss of power produces corresponding shifts in influence; however, these effects are contingent upon peoples experiences with power and conflict at the time of organizational entry. Individuals who enter an organization wielding considerable structural power can acquire enduring cognitive rigiditiesa stamp of powerthat subsequently make them less influential, while those who initially experience conflict can derive lasting learning benefitsa stamp of conflictthat later make them more influential. We evaluate and find support for these propositions in analyses of the U.S. Senate from 1973 to 2009: (1) senators became more influential when their party moved into the majority and when they became committee chairs; (2) entering the Senate as a member of the majority party dampened senators subsequent ability to exert influence; and (3) initial assignment to politically divided committees enhanced senators later influence. We discuss implications for research on power, conflict, and imprinting."
2015,"The Impact of Competitor Information on Search Behavior We used behavioral data to examine the impact of knowledge spillovers and competitor rankings on backward-looking search behavior. The stimuli were nested within a management simulation that included backward-looking search of an NK landscape. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four treatments. Information about competitors search progress was the only difference between the four treatments. We found that providing participants with information ranking their search progress against that of their competitors resulted in searches that were more intense, distant, and persistent. In contrast, data including only knowledge spillovers had a more limited impact on search behavior. Additionally, we observed an inverted-U shaped relationship between the likelihood with which performance decreasing changes were preserved and quality of the search's eventual outcome."
2015,"Vicarious Learning as a Source of Intermittent Revisits to the Hot Stove In organizational learning, learning processes may produce a bias against risk or for risk, depending on the type of learning mode employed. The tendency to focus on experiential learning often results in a bias against risky alternatives, while a focus on vicarious learning creates a bias for risk. In this paper, we offer a model in which experiential and vicarious learning are integrated, exploring a type of risk-taking behavior that has received scant attention in the learning literature: intermittent risk-taking. Employing a computational model, we attempt to identify conditions under which such intermittent risk-taking behaviors can arise. More specifically, we build on the hot stove model (Denrell & March, 2001) by introducing a vicarious learning component suggested by the performance-feedback model. Our study provides a bridge between the risk-taking literature and the organizational learning literature by explaining time-varying risk-taking patterns. Furthermore, we suggest a learning-based explanation for habitual entrepreneurship."
2015,"Organization Design as Guided Network Evolution In an organization, patterns of interaction between individuals are influenced by two strong inertial forces: the mandates of the formal organization and the desire of agents to preserve their existing social network. In contrast, problemistic search by individuals seeking for new social connections provides the basis for change. How these forces interact and the consequences for organizational adaptation and change are the focus of this paper. We explore these issues through a formal agent-based computational model which reflects organization design as the guided (by the formal structure) evolution of the informal organization (in particular the networks of interaction between individuals). The analysis of the model uncovers two mechanisms shaping the interplay between formal and informal structure complementary and substitutive inertiawhose operation depends both on the accuracy of the designers architectural knowledge and the agents aspiration levels. Insights from our model contribute to the emergent literature investigating the links between formal and informal organization."
2015,"Organizational Adaptation through the Survival of the Unfittest Evolutionary metaphors are often used to describe the processes of organizational adaptation. However, evolutionary processes in organizations are different from biological processes of evolution in at least two important ways: first, unlike genes, individuals as units of selection can adapt to and learn from each other. Second, individuals may voluntarily leave the organization  they deselected themselves rather than being deselected by the environment. This is particularly true for high performers. If we take these two deviations from biological theories of evolution seriously, we can observe that optimal progress in organizational adaptation is not necessarily observed if only high performers survive (i.e. with Darwinian selection or survival of the fittest selection regime). Instead, our computational model shows that under some conditions, organizations are better off if their unfittest members survive, in particular if agents learn fast."
2015,"The Best and the Rest: How Firm Status Diminishes the Positive Performance Effects of Ambidexterity This study seeks to explain bestseller success in cultural industries, combining ambidexterity and status research. We argue that the positive performance effects of ambidexterity decrease when high firm status reduces quality uncertainty. Analyzing a large panel data set from the German publishing industry, we find that while lower status producers suffer from negative consequences of under- and over-exploration, higher status firms can achieve superior success with any position along the exploration-exploitation continuum. The study contributes to ambidexterity research by suggesting firm status as novel boundary condition of the ambidexterity  firm performance relationship. It moreover has implications for research on status and the creative industries."
2015,"Eclipsed and Confounded Identities: When High-Status Affiliations Impede Organizational Growth I propose that an organizations growth potential may suffer if its identity is eclipsed by or confounded with the organizations with which it collaborates and competes. Using status as a salient feature of identity, I devise two network measures to capture the degree to which organizations identities are eclipsed and confounded. The theory is tested with data on U.S. venture capital firm syndication between 1995 and 2009. Venture capital firms with eclipsed and confounded identities are less likely to raise a new fund, and occupying a high-status position exacerbates the penalty for having an eclipsed or confounded identity. These findings highlight the previously neglected identity costs that high-status firms impose on their partners. In status- based market competition organizations need to justify their identity claims by distinguishing themselves from the established elite."
2015,"Status as a Catalyst: The Effect of Investment Banks' Status on Acquisition Process This study examines how the external and internal status dynamics of advisory teams shortens the public takeover process of cross-border acquisitions. We first test the delaying effects of deal-specific uncertainty and institutional difference between the targets and acquirers on the duration of acquisition process. We argue that the status advantages of advisor banks can be transferred to the deal participants and alleviate the uncertainty throughout the deal process. Furthermore, as opposed to the widely acknowledged notion of status homophily, we propose that advisory teams with members of heterophilous status are more successful in resolving acquisition deals. Findings using panel data on cross-border acquisition deals in the period 1996 to 2010 provide support for our arguments."
2015,"Status, Structural Holes, and Innovation: The Moderating Role of Status This paper investigates the effects of the firms structural positions within social systems, particularly the effects of their status in technology space and access to structural holes in alliance networks, on technological innovation. While prior studies have found mixed results regarding the effects of structural holes on the firms innovation performance, we argue that status would negatively moderate the association between structural holes and innovation activities by substituting the information benefits and limiting the control benefits of structural holes. We examine our theory and hypotheses in the context of the U.S. biotechnology industry between 1981 and 2006, where the biotech firms frequently form strategic alliances to engage in innovation activities. From the empirical analyses of the patterns of these firms patent applications, we found that the firms access to structural holes does not have a direct effect, while their status has a strong, positive influence on their innovation activities. More importantly, the results show that the effect of structural holes on innovation performance is negatively moderated by the firms status. This study contributes to the literature by suggesting the importance of systematically considering the firms embeddedness in social structures, particularly the interaction between their positions in status hierarchy and structural holes."
2015,"Transnational Institutional Conflict and Deinstitutionalization of the Swiss Banking Secrecy From our case study on the deinstitutionalization of the Swiss banking secrecy, we developed a grounded process theory on how transnational institutional conflict leads to the deinstitutionalization of a national institution. Our theory suggests that deinstitutionalization unfolds through an interactive conflict process with four sequential practices of national actors resistance and transnational challengers power use. Our model highlights that when a national institution is problematized by transnational challengers, national institutional guardians' attempts at protecting the supremacy of the national institution can have important unintended consequences: On the one hand, by inducing feelings of safety among incumbent organiza-tions, guardians protection work can motivate incumbent organizations to circumvent the demands of transnational challengers. On the other hand, by inducing feelings of outrage among transnational challengers, protection work can lead these challengers to escalate the institutional conflict. Together, these developments can provoke institutional breaches and contribute to deinstitutionalization of a national institution."
2015,"End of the Samurai: A Study of Deinstitutionalization Processes Despite the critical role of deinstitutionalization to institutional change, few studies have been conducted of this process. As such, limited theorizing of this process has been established, with much presumed about its characteristics and trajectory. Building upon Olivers (1992) three suggested pathways for deinstitutionalization (rejection, replacement, dissipation), I develop a framework for deinstitutionalization processes using the example of the demise of the samurai warrior class in Japan."
2015,"How SMOs and Corporations Use Protests and Lobbying to Influence Institutional Change This study explores the simultaneous influence that social movement organizations (SMOs) and corporations have on institutional change. By studying the enactment of comprehensive smoking bans by US states between 2000 and 2012, the effect of protests and lobbying by SMOs and corporations on the enactment of tobacco control regulations is explored. The results shed light on the reduced effectiveness of protests as a mechanism to influence institutional change for both actors when their claims gain visibility and public support. The results also show that lobbying is a less effective mechanism for institutional change when the actor that lobbies lacks legitimacy. Overall, the study contributes to institutional and social movement theories, by empirically uncovering the simultaneous influence of movements and counter-movements that use different mechanisms to change institutions."
2015,"The Disruptive Effect of Exogenous Shocks on Logics Support on the Micro Level Research indicates that exogenous shocks are important triggers of institutional change. Yet, research suffers from a success bias; that is, it focuses on instances in which shocks have triggered changes in institutional logics. This leaves the impression that shocks trigger institutional change under each condition. Yet, we can observe macro-level variation in responses to shocks ranging from institutional maintenance to institutional change. Research so far provides little insights into reasons for macro-level variation. In this paper, we argue explaining the macro-level variation requires a better understanding of the effects of shocks on the micro level. Therefore, this paper analyzes how shocks affect individuals evaluation of an institutional logic and how macro-level boundary conditions moderate individuals reaction to exogenous shocks. We use the bankruptcy of the Lehman Brothers as a natural experiment that allows us to explore the conditional influence of exogenous shocks on the strength of institutional logics. We find that shocks negatively affect individuals evaluation of an institutional logic. Additionally, the study identifies prior degree of institutionalization of an institutional logic both on the societal level and in individuals environment as an important boundary condition of the disruption of logics. Our study contributes to research on institutional change."
2015,"Addressing Institutional Complexity: The Role of Formalization and Collaboration This paper explores how organizations manage internal tensions triggered by institutional complexity. The results of our multi- case study show how an organization embodying antithetic logics at the core of its functioning can succeed in solving internal conflicts by developing an overarching, blended logic that integrates them. Based on a longitudinal, comparative study, this paper argues that organizations should first compartmentalize logics and only subsequently integrate them. A new, overarching, blended logic can be developed relying on the structured interaction between two crucial mechanisms: collaboration and formalization. The former is the iterative and cooperative actions activated to identify synergic solutions to complex problems. The latter is the definition of a protocol of written rules, procedures and instructions for tasks accomplishment. Our findings show that, while collaboration alone does not enable logics change and formalization alone fosters logics detachment; the interaction between collaboration and formalization facilitate logics integration. These findings contribute to better understand intra-organizational mechanisms to overcome internal conflicts. They also link micro and macro institutional research by accounting for the influence of institutional logics on the actual practices enacted by an organization over time."
2015,"Benefiting from Institutional Complexity: How Organizations Engage with Minority Logics Institutional complexity  being simultaneously exposed to multiple institutional logics  is commonly perceived as a challenge and source of tension for organizations. In this paper we argue that rather than being a source of tension, complexity may represent an opportunity for organizations to accrue certain benefits. They may therefore deliberately expose themselves to institutional complexity. Using an inductive study of university-industry research centers, we illustrate how research universities obtained benefits by embracing a minority logic (the commercial logic), in addition to remaining committed to their dominant, academic logic. We argue that organizations achieve this by creating special boundary spaces where institutional complexity is confined. These boundary spaces are sufficiently differentiated from the mainstream organization to enable it to attract audiences adhering to alternative logics. Simultaneously, they are also sufficiently integrated with the mainstream organization to avoid excessive tensions arising from the presence of multiple logics. Our study has significant implications for our understanding of institutional complexity in three ways. We suggest that organizations deliberately seek institutional complexity, we identify the special organizational structures useful in minimizing potential disruption, and we point to the role of hybrid leaders in operating successful boundary spaces."
2015,"Mobilizing Around Seemingly Opposite Logics in Kenyas Conservation Field Contrary to existing studies emphasizing how logics compete and conflict, this study presents a case of complementary logics. Drawing on a rich qualitative case study of the African Wildlife Foundation (AWF), this paper illuminates how seemingly opposite field-level logics may converge over time through attempts to attain and sustain an organizations mission. More specifically, the study highlights how the presence of institutional voids created institutional complexity by constraining AWF in achieving its conservation mission, how these voids prompted AWF to explore the compatibility between seemingly opposite logics and how its actions resulted in an organizational mission underpinned by an expanding, complementary logic constellation. The case findings suggest that such hybridization may bring new symbolic capital to mobilize resources, but may also create legitimacy threats when in holding the organization accountable for its actions institutional referents emphasize the oppositional base of the combined logics. Overall, the paper contributes to the emerging literature on complexity response strategies by uncovering the interplay between logics, voids and agency in understanding the hybridization of organizations."
2015,"Organizations and Institutional Complexity: A Political Process Model Research on institutional complexity assumes that organizations are compelled to actively attend to inconsistencies that arise from being embedded in divergent institutional environments. A political process perspective of organizations holds that such inconsistencies are ubiquitous in complex organizations but often unproblematic. Instead, active organizational responses to institutional complexity are contingent on external political contestation by activists and the internal politics of the organization. Based on this perspective, we develop a political process model and derive propositions about when organizations attend to inconsistencies and how they respond. We argue that organizational attention and responses depend on the structure of organizational coalitions, formal structures of authority and decision-making, organizational identity, and organizational capabilities. Overall, the model advances research on the political dimension of institutional complexity."
2015,"What Got You Here Won't Get You There: Peripheral Knowledge Workers and Their Strategies for Success This study examines the knowledge and skills that marginal actors prioritize in service of their professional development and advancement. I analyze over 1,000 stories from a rich dataset of 105 semi-structured interviews with senior leaders of a global investment bank. Through inductive analysis of stories, I build on a nascent literature about peripherality, which refers to individuals perceptions of being outsiders at work. I find that those who perceive themselves to be peripheral disproportionately value technical knowledge. I argue that peripherality is associated with the pursuit of technical knowledge for two reasons. First, technical knowledge is accessible, relatively independent from interactions and relationships with others. Second, technical knowledge is legitimate, perceived as rational and meritocratic. These findings may expose knowledge-seeking behaviors as a mechanism behind stratification within internal labor markets. As peripheral actors pursue technical knowledge, they may actually neglect knowledge about interactions and relationships that is necessary for the upper echelons of organizations and management. That different knowledge-seeking behaviors may have negative consequences for career outcomes of peripheral members demonstrates the importance of attending to the micro-foundations of human capital."
2015,"Identity Construction and Sustained Participation in an Open Source Software Project The viability of open productions depends critically on their ability to attract and retain voluntary contributors. This study shifts attention from the principal focus of existing research, on ex-ante motivations  intrinsic and extrinsic  for this voluntary participation, to examine the nature of contributions over time and the consequences for sustaining participation. We suggest that participant retention is critically impacted by the social dynamics of open productions through the progressive socialization and legitimation of participants in the course of their work. Individuals construct their identity profiles as specialists or generalists by narrowly focusing or widely dispersing their efforts across knowledge domains. Drawing from the literature on the sociology of categories, we argue that the expertise of specialist contributors is more easily evaluated by fellow participants, aiding integration and fostering sustained participation. However, we propose a moderating mechanism inherent in the collaborative nature of open productions, whereby the beneficial effect of a specialist identity is diminished as contributors engage and re-engage in collaborative practices. This allows repeat collaborators to broaden their identity profile without damaging their standing within the community, on which their continued participation relies. We test our hypotheses using data on problem-solving in the form of source code contributions to the Apache HTTP Server repository. We examine the duration of the participation of 82 individuals who contribute 1425 commits, involving 10757 files over the time period 1996-2013. The results support our arguments. We discuss the broader implications for the literature on sustained participation in open productions and on the sociology of categorization processes."
2015,"Learning in a Multitask Setting: Tasks Competition for Attention Although research has already demonstrated that social actors learn from the experience of executing tasks (i.e., learning by doing) and other related tasks (i.e., spillovers), little is still known about how learning occurs in situations where actors execute multiple tasks simultaneously (i.e., multitask settings). In this study, we examine how social actors learn the focal task in multitask settings and how the nonfocal tasks that they execute together with the focal task influence the learning rates of the focal tasks. We propose that because learning requires social actors attention, and tasks need to compete with each other for attention in multitask settings, they are less likely to learn the focal task when executing it together with the nonfocal tasks with high salience. We also predict that this effect of the nonfocal tasks salience is moderated or strengthened with the nonfocal tasks levels of difficulty as well as the focal tasks salience. We find support for our hypotheses using data of figure skaters who participated in major international competitions during 20062013. Keywords: Learning of task, multitask setting, attention, failure of tasks, new tasks, task difficulty"
2015,"A War in Ninety Seconds: Moderation and Escalation of Neighborhood Rivalry in the Palio di Siena Sociologists observe that social conflict is relational and endogenous, posing the problem of avoiding its escalation. Proposed mechanisms include the mobilization of strong ties and of weak, cross-cutting ties. We highlight an alternative mechanism based on career mobility  moving between competitors. The overlaying of past affiliations on current employment creates relational multiplexity, preventing the automatic reproduction of loyalties fostering escalation. This regulator is identified in an analysis of longitudinal data on the most famous horse race in the world  the Palio di Siena, where deeply-felt, long-standing rivalries and alliances between neighborhoods are manifested. The analysis draws attention to the dark side of networks, attesting that the activation of alliances increases the number of Palio-related incidents, as it raises the stakes for all competitors. Tension is released through mobility  the career moves of jockeys are associated with a lower incidence rate, as the social content of past affiliations moderates the willingness to engage in hostilities. Formal and informal networks intermix and influence each other in a way that is neither explicitly intended, nor is fully visible to participants."
2015,"How Markets Form: Intermediation in the UK Social Investment Market Questions about market formation have engaged economic sociologists and organization theorists for decades. Research so far has shown that, rather than studying how supply meets demand, we need to look at networks, culture, and power relations if we want to understand how markets are shaped. In this research project I conduct a field ethnography of the social investment market in the UK, focused on the period from 2000 to 2014, in order to ground these insights around market formation in a context that is full of experimentation, ambiguity, and contestation. I find three overall processes  connecting actors, lobbying, and creating a discourse  that are central to the formation of this nascent market, each with different mechanisms, and I link these findings to a new perspective on theories of intermediation."
2015,"The Resurgence of the Locavore: The Growth of Local Food Markets in the United States Sociological studies of markets have recognized that markets are embedded in various types of economic exchange institutions. Although a growing number of these studies have examined moral markets, important questions persist: What role, if any, do traditions of civic engagement play in the emergence of moral markets? What is the impact of alternative forms of production on moral markets? Does local social movement activism influence moral markets development? We build on sociological theories of markets to address these questions in the context of the rapid growth of markets for local food. Our contribution to theories of market embeddedness and contention is threefold. First, by focusing on the role of civic engagement in the emergence and growth of moral markets, we examine the flip side of the argument that markets foster cooperation because they bind people to one another. Second, we extend sociological arguments about the importance of political processes and interactions among producers by examining whether alternative forms of production impact moral markets development. Third, rather than examining the general processes through which movements imbue markets with social values, we examine whether local traditions of social movement activism contribute to the emergence and growth of moral markets."
2015,"Positive Effects of Arbitration on the Emergence of a New Organizational Form: Online Newspapers This paper examines the emergence of a new organizational form from the perspective of the indirect participants of the process who are not the two main players, that is, entrepreneurial firms and interested audiences. Specifically, we argue that negative responses from indirect existing stakeholders to a new organizational form make the differences between the current and new forms more salient to interested audiences. This increased perception of dissimilarity then positively affects the emergence of the new organizational form. Entrepreneurial firms can also exploit the contrast effect created by existing stakeholders by explicitly highlighting dissimilarity. To test our hypotheses, we focus on the South Korean newspaper industry and legal contestations between existing stakeholders, including incumbent print newspapers and government agencies, and online newspapers, members of a new organizational form in the given industry. We find support for our theoretical arguments that litigations or arbitrations positively affected the founding rate of online newspapers. Online newspapers further improved their organizational legitimation by explicitly emphasizing the distinctiveness of online journalism compared to print media, such as citizen reporters, in their mission statements."
2015,"New Form Emergence and Resource Partitioning This research investigates an important question in organizational sociology, namely the emergence of novel organizational forms. It takes the underdeveloped community ecology perspective and proposes a new mechanism of form emergence - resource partitioning. I argue that during market partitioning based on oppositional identities of the incumbent center and peripheral forms, the saliency of the relevant identity features increases. This results in rising social demands for the features considered as both relevant and desirable by audiences. As a consequence, entirely new forms with such identity features may emerge to realize the demands. However, the emergence of new forms varies across audience segments, illustrated here in terms of geographic communities. More specifically, the founding rate of the new organizational form depends on: (1) the degree to which its identity features fit with the local audience tastes; (2) the extent to which the local demands on the identity attributes are satisfied by the extant organizational forms. The empirical testing of the theoretical propositions is carried out through examining the electricity cooperative foundings in Germany during 1999-2011."
2015,"What Does It Mean to Design? While the term design is finding resurgence among academics and practitioners, there is still little clarity as to what it means. Our study investigates what it means to design by developing and applying a framework that examines the vocabularies used by members of a center for design at a large public university. The findings reveal similarities and differences in the meanings accorded to the term design by these individuals. It also reveals awareness by individuals that their notion of design is incomplete. Such reflexivity enables these individuals to meaningfully interact with one another. Overall, design appears to be an interactive object, enabling different meaning structures to co-exist across disciplinary boundaries. In the discussion section, we highlight implications of our findings for related literature streams and explore why an interactive object such as design is valuable for addressing complex issues such as sustainability, entrepreneurship and the like."
2015,"In Search of Lost Space: A Processual view of Lefebvre This paper adds a more processual perspective to Lefebvres Production of Space (1991/1974), foregrounding the constitutive exclusion of space production by drawing attention to disposal of space and to practices of remembering related to these. Some discarded by-products, we argue, re-enter the production process and this is observed in practices of remembering connected with the planning and construction of a large culture centre. We explore the interconnections between the conceived, lived and perceived spaces of Lefebvres spatial triad in the light of a further element, lost space, which allows us to appreciate the dialectic between space products and by-products, their non-linear becoming, and the productive role of practices of remembering."
2015,"The Empirical Expression of Relational Leadership: Turning Points in Responsive Interplays This paper responds to this years Academy call to opening governance and exploring practices that mandate for action. I wish to respond to the call from the leadership field of studies, drawing on the divisions interest in process thinking. The paper questions the dominant individualistic lens in leadership studies as problematic in the fluctuating, ever-changing process of becoming (Chia & Holt, 2009), and proposes a relational understanding that goes beyond dualistic assumptions of separation (Gergen, 2009). This is explored in an empirical study, focusing on the processes of relating in responsive interplays in dialogue, where turning points punctuate the expression of leadership. The paper ends with a discussion about leadership as an ongoing, polymorphic process in pursuit of co-created direction."
2015,"A Key Constraint to Conceptual Blending  Examining Two Metalanguages of Change In organization management theory it has become a widespread practice to blend conceptual systems to reach theoretical novelty. In this theoretical paper it is argued that conceptual blending is however constrained by the existence of a narrow set of conceptual strategies for describing change. These strategies are also exceptionally difficult to blend in novel ways. We exemplify this issue by examining two inherently divergent metalanguages of change. It is argued that the two have inherently consistent and yet mutually incompatible organizing frames that obstruct the construction of bridging conceptual blends. As examples of metalanguages the influential Freudian entity-based metalanguage (e.g., rootcause, forces, conflicts, and resistance) is contrasted with the Batesonian communication and systems metalanguage (e.g., patterns, difference, and information). This paper draws attention to how metalanguages may direct theorizing, spawn theoretical problems of their own origin, and how they can be incompatible. The main contention of this paper is that an understanding of metalanguages can be useful in identifying possible blind spots and in anticipating future problems in theory development. This paper ends by discussing the conceptual limitations originating from metalanguages, how they could be overcome together with the possible benefits for organizational management theory."
2015,"Culling Black Sheep to Better the Flock: The Positive CSR Outcomes Of Negative Screening This paper explores whether and how negative screening of firms by a prominent institutional investor could lead to broader social welfare benefits. Extending research on negative spillover effects of delegitimizing events, we offer the first systematic study of the effect of censorship, defined as divestments which incorporate public naming and shaming, on non-culpable firms corporate social responsibility. Employing a quasi-natural experiment, we show that non-culpable firms proactively respond to the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Funds censorship announcements by improving their corporate social responsibility. Further, we draw on attention- based theory and test a number of mechanisms that moderate the effect of censorship. We find that the effect of censorship is greater in the presence of shareholder activism and higher ownership stakes. Our investigation into the phenomena of censorship unites two separate literatures on negative spillovers and institutional activism. We also show that portfolio membership to be a more relevant category space compared to industry in the presence of censorship, contrary to extant theory on industry categorization. From a policy standpoint, these findings suggest that social investors current criticisms toward negative screening and the privileged use of management dialogues alone may be misguided and should be revisited."
2015,"Seeking the Genesis of Change: Free Space and Its Measure Being able to identify and characterize free space a priori is key to fomenting change to discriminatory power structures through organized resistance among non-elites, providing space where they can act outside the normal confines pervading social systems. We draw upon the collective resistance, reflective measurement and formative measurement specification literatures to establish stronger conceptual boundaries of what free space is and is not. We report two studies validating a universal measure for both physical and virtualized social contexts. Our findings provide evidence for the validity of our conceptualization of the construct. We discuss implications for the collective resistance literature."
2015,"Institutions that Build and that Bind: Incumbent Strategies in the Battle over Renewable Energy Economic markets are embedded in a broader social context, shaping firm behavior and increasing the importance of relationships with nonmarket actors, such as civil society and the state. Firms strategies in managing these nonmarket interests are guided by the formal rules, informal norms, and taken-for-granted assumptions that constitute the institutional structure of society. But, despite incentives to adhere to these rules of the game, some firms violate social norms, employing extra-institutional strategies  such as forming front groups and astroturfing  and thus risking their reputations and their legitimacy. This study investigates the use of these unexpected nonmarket strategies, examining when and why firms are likely to engage in these risky behaviors. Through an examination of the electric power industry in the U.S., this study follows incumbent firm responses to pro- renewable energy SMs as they advocate for the creation of a wind energy market space. Through an inductive analysis of four state- level cases, theory is developed around the role of institutional entrenchment and the institutional work of social movements in incumbent firms decisions to employ extra-institutional nonmarket strategies."
2015,"Blacklisted Benefactors: The Political Contestation of Non-Market Strategy This paper explores whether and how contentious stakeholders can disrupt a firms non-market strategy. We offer the first systematic study of the effect of public protest on corporate political activity, using a unique database that allows us to empirically analyze the impact of social movement boycotts on targeted firms campaign contributions. We show that boycotts lead to significant reductions in the amount of targets campaign contributions and increase the proportion of contributions that politicians refund. These results highlight the importance of considering how a firms socio-political environment shapes its non-market strategy. We supplement this primary analysis by drawing from social movement theory to extrapolate and test a number of mechanisms that moderate the extent to which movement challenges effectively disrupt corporate political activity."
2015,"Aligning Internal and External R&D; with Environmental Elements and Innovation Performance This study examines how configurations between a firms internal and external research and development (R&D;) strategies with environmental elements (dynamism, munificence, and complexity) affect a firms innovation performance. From a resource dependence perspective, we argue that the configuration approach provides useful insights into dilemmas surrounding whether internal and external R&D; are complements or substitutes. Using a longitudinal sample of manufacturing firms in China, the results show that internal and external R&D; are neither complements nor substitutes in predicting innovative performance. However, under turbulent, munificent, and complex environments, the effects of internal and external R&D; on innovative performance vary in direction and magnitude, which indicates that R&D; strategies respond to environmental opportunities and constraints in the development of commercializable new products."
2015,"Buyers Differential Social Control within Supplier Portfolio and Its Effect on Performance Developing social control over buyer-supplier relationships is of great importance for a buying firm to generate competitive advantages. However, subject to the constraints of resources and attentions, a buying firm can hardly develop equally important relationships with all suppliers. Whether and how a buying firm employing differential social control on multiple suppliers generates overall value from its supplier portfolio, instead of within an individual dyadic relationship alone, are of great strategic importance but not well examined in the literature. Based on social capital theory and taking a portfolio perspective, this paper explores the effect of a buyers differential social control within its supplier portfolio on its performance. Using data from both primary survey and secondary archival data from China which consists of 128 manufacturing firms and supplier portfolios, we find that a buyers differential social control within its supplier portfolio negatively affects its performance. In addition, this negative effect will be enhanced when demand uncertainty is high, but will be attenuated when technology uncertainty is high. The study extends our understanding of social control mechanism in supply chain management and suggests important managerial implications for buying firms in their supplier management."
2015,"Extending Organization Theory to Contract Manufacturers that Build their Own Brand Both Transaction Cost Economics and Resource Dependence Theory devote significant attention to how organizations draw their boundaries; which value chain activities are done internally, and which ones are outsourced. A recent phenomenon associated with outsourcing is the increasing incidence of contract manufacturers that seek to build their own brands. There are compelling reasons for contract manufacturers to build their own brand. Chief among them is the need for these companies to reduce their dependence on powerful, brand-owning customers. However, the brand-building process contains an inherent contradiction: brand-building is a long, expensive process, the costs of which are often funded by ongoing manufacturing operations. Few brand-owning companies are willing to fund their next competitors. Contract manufacturers must decide whether or not to build their own brand, and if so, how they will manage their dependence on powerful customers going forward. In this paper, I argue that the guidance of Transaction Cost Economics and Resource Dependence Theory can be extended to a consideration of the make or brand decision facing contract manufacturers."
2015,"Rethinking the Hidden Cost of Offshoring: the Impacts of Strategy and Experience This study investigates the so-called hidden cost of offshoring the discrepancy between expected costs and actual costs that is often viewed as cost-estimation error of decision makers due to their bounded rationality in situations of complexity. Based on data from the Offshoring Research Network, we find the corporate strategy for guiding offshoring decisions may motivate managers to deliberately lower organizational aspiration for offshoring projects and result in enhanced alignment between expectation and achievement. This provides a plausible complementary perspective to rethink the occurrence reason of overrun costs of offshoring implementation other than the complexity explanationwithout constraints from formal planning and evaluation, the cost estimation of managers may be bold and rough with less concerns about uncertainty avoidance. Moreover, we show that it may take at least five years for firms to learn how to manage offshoring activities and use experiential knowledge to reduce cost-estimation errors."
2015,"The Hierarchy Myopia of Organizational Learning Previous studies have been interested in how to maximize both the efficiency and the effectiveness of organizational learning. On the flipside, some studies have investigated the critical barriers to learning. We suggest organizational hierarchy as another cause and theoretically explore how it can deter learning performance. Specifically, we argue that the configuration of structure determines a prevalent form of learning method in an organization to consequently affect its learning performance. Using simulation modeling, we show that non-hierarchical organizations may be a better learning environment than hierarchical organizations. We also show that the contextual factors, such as problem complexity and member regrouping, may affect the base-line result. This study subsequently calls for further attention be paid to the key issues concerning the hierarchy and organization learning performance."
2015,"The Politics of Organizational Learning Studies of organizational learning often assume that rational organizations always pursue intelligence and, therefore, ascribe all failures to learn to cognitive biases, costly information, or incapable information aggregation routines. However, organizational learning requires collecting information, which impacts both the goal-setting process within organizations and the ability of organizations to achieve their goals. The goal-setting process is inherently political. My paper develops a formal model that introduces political conflict into a theory of organizational learning. My model has a key insight: even in organizations where actors are rational and where there are no difficulties in aggregating information, organizational leaders may still choose not to learn, because leaders can attain better organizational outcomes (for themselves) if they do not collect information than if they do."
2015,"A Network-Learning Model of Strategic Change To what extent does the relationship between the formal authority of the organization to designate interpersonal interactions, and the discretion of individuals to selectinteraction partners contribute to the successful adaptation of an organization to strategic change?Building upon the punctuated equilibrium model of change, a dynamic agent-based learning and network evolution model is developed toinvestigate the relationship between formal authority and individual discretion.The model makes use of the genetic algorithm to simulate the learning of bothleaders and individuals in the pursuit of an ideal configuration of interpersonal interactions in support of the strategic change.The outcome of the simulationis the theoretical claim that the more that interpersonal interactions are designated by formal authority versus chosen atindividual discretion, the more adverse the effect on the success of strategic change."
2015,"The Role of Hierarchy and Middle Management in Learning It is commonly known that superiors in an organization can lead subordinates in learning because the former have more experience and organization-related knowledge. By combining empirical data for a hierarchical network and computational methods, we argue that even without such prior experience or knowledge, superiors can do better and improve organizational performance through hierarchical intervention. In particular, our computational analysis shows that in general subordinates are more likely to learn from their bosses than from their peers at the same rank or their subordinates. Also, the implementation of hierarchical intervention generates a chain change of reactions which in turn lowers the tendency of inward looking bias. We show that this remarkable order in learning dynamics arises from the topological regularity inherent in a typical hierarchical organizational structure, where different ideas and knowledge are primarily exchanged through superiors (to a large extent middle managers) who are more exposed to a diversity of ideas and knowledge than their subordinates. We also find that a modest level of transferring individuals to other subgroups is conducive to effective learning, suggesting that job rotation is an alternative to hierarchy for bridging different subgroups with diverse knowledge and ideas."
2015,"Best in Class? The Returns on Endorsement in Business School Admissions Substantial research has focused on how organizational and network processes may affect the screening and hiring of individuals into organizations. Less attention, however, has been devoted to examining how socio-economic processes may also affect applicant assessment and selection. We begin to address this gap in the literature by investigating how endorsementsa common (formal and informal) practice involving the granting of support to certain applicants by high-status individualsmay influence selection and post-selection outcomes in the context of an elite business school. In particular, we test five complementary explanations for why endorsed applicants (by faculty, business elite, donors, or alumni), relative to their non-endorsed counterparts, may be more successful in key evaluation processes: They may 1) be assessed to be better qualified, 2) have superior knowledge of selection procedures, 3) benefit from perceptions of status associated with their endorsement (i.e., a status signal), irrespective of their qualifications, 4) accept offers at higher rates, and/or 5) be better matched to the position/organization. To test these explanations regarding the returns on endorsements, we analyze all 21,324 applicants to a full-time MBA program between 2002 and 2008. We only find support for the status signal explanation. Endorsed applicants are significantly advantaged over non-endorsed applicants during interview and admission decisions, even after controlling for key individual qualifications and competencies. Yet, endorsed applicants that enroll do not achieve superior academic performance or job market outcomes upon graduation. We conclude by discussing implications for understanding the role socio-economic mechanisms may play in labor markets today."
2015,"Threading the Diversity Needle: The Impact of Minority Group Presence on Organizational Status Amidst competition for status, colleges in the U.S. position themselves as unique and desirable places to spend four years, highlighting their distinctive academic, social, and extracurricular benefits to potential applicants. Part of this positioning includes an important, if amorphous, commitment to diversity. Each applicant, in selecting where to apply, has an idiosyncratic understanding of what diversity actually means; preferences differ accordingly. This leaves diversity-promoting schools to figure out roughly what an appropriate mix of students is, while applicants then choose from an array of institutions. In aggregate, students selections have consequences for the status of the school, as applicants decisions signal desirability and prestige to future applicants. Against this backdrop, two seemingly incongruous phenomena exist: increases in the proportion of a schools Asian American studentsa high scoring and achieving groupimprove a schools ranking, but appear to cause harm in the eyes of applicants and peer schools administrators. These are two key constituencies from whom schools seek status rewards in the form of applications and peer assessments, respectively. I explore the loss of status associated with increased Asian American presence on campus and discuss the implications of these dynamics."
2015,"Crossing Audiences: The Influence of Consumer Reviews on Organizational Prestige and Attraction To what extent do evaluations built by and for a specific audience end up influencing a different audience? Work on categorization theory has studied the impact of audiences and of the classifications they make of organizations, yet it has not shed much light on whether and how the effects of classifications made by a given audience might extend to different audiences, especially if they were not the intended recipient of the original evaluation. To study this cross-audience effect, we investigate the extent to which consumer reviews affect potential employees employment-related judgments. Given that potential job candidates scan the environment for information about prospective employers, there is reason to expect spillover effects from one audience to another  information and organizational categorizations created by and for customers may be used by potential job applicants when evaluating an organizations attractiveness and prestige as an employer. In this study, we investigate these cross-audience effects, contributing simultaneously to the categorization and recruitment literatures. Utilizing an experimental design, we show that exposure to categories developed by and for customers (positive vs. negative product reviews) resulted in significantly different ratings of organizational attraction and prestige as an employer. This effect is contingent on how representative the product reviews were of a companys overall product line, as well as on participants initial familiarity with the organization. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed."
2015,"Transferring Celebrity from the CEO to the Organization: An Exploratory Study Organizational celebrity has the potential to be an intangible resource for the firm. Celebrity, however, is often attributed to the CEO rather than the firm. For this reason, understanding the potential transfer of celebrity from the CEO to the organization is of primary importance. We argue that celebrity is a cultural commodity that develops through a co-creation process of exchanges and interactions among CEOs, organizations and media. In this paper, we argue that the transfer of celebrity from the individual to the organizational level depends on causal attributions made by these social actors about the firms actions and success. We develop and test hypotheses using a sample of CEO-organization dyads from Fortune 500. Specifically, we look at the change in organizational celebrity before and after the tenure of a CEO, in industries that experience either high medium of low level of media visibility."
2015,"Rituals as Conditional Enactments: The Initiation and Evolution of the NBA Players Draft Rituals are ubiquitous in business, yet despite their performative regularity and homogeneity, there is no clear explanation as to why the rules of a ritual or the story-line underlying it may change. Using an archival institutional analysis of the Players Draft of the National Basketball Association (NBA) which was introduced as a ritual to allocate amateur talent to the leagues teams when the league was first formed and still persists todaywe theorize rituals as conditional enactments, reflecting an extended conversation between those who initiate and/or shepherd the ritual to its present form (i.e., ritual keepers) and stakeholders who derive meaning and value from the rituals performance. By following a ritual from its inception to present day, we add an important level of historiocity to the study of rituals in the management literature. Our study contributes both theoretically to the ritual literature laying out the conditions under which rituals change or do not changeand methodologically by adopting snowballing to fact finding and categorizing around existing definitions rather than creating new ones."
2015,"Water Warriors at Work: The Actors and Maintenance of Institutions in a Contested Field The study of field and institutional change has grown rapidly, yet we continue to understand relatively little about the actors and activities of maintenance in the face of such pressures. As actors seek to protect natural resources, and the institutions that surround them, maintenance activities will become increasingly challenging. Using the field of U.S. municipal water services as a research context, qualitative data including 41 interviews with leading actors in Detroit and Chicago were used to examine the dynamics of the emerging conflict over water services. Findings show, first, an important role for the actors that defend and maintain institutions, and illustrate that they are not homogenous. A typology of actors maintaining institutions in a contested field is developed: warriors, converts, practitioners, and revisionists. Second, findings uncover several unique forms of institutional work suggesting that the work of defending neglected and highly taken-for-granted institutions begins with creating awareness, specifically attention and care. This study offers insights for theory on institutional work and maintenance as well as for the governments, activists, and corporations seeking to better steward water resources."
2015,"Legitimacy Traps Scholars since Weber have acknowledged the fundamental role of legitimacy in the social world. Theoretical and empirical work overwhelmingly advances a sanguine yet static view of legitimacy; legitimacy both enables institutionalization and authorizes action. In contrast, this paper explores the dynamics of legitimation processes and emphasizes that legitimacy, like any element of social structure, both enables and constrains action. When the undesired constraints associated with the on-going construction of legitimacy become both salient and entrenched, the result is a legitimacy trap. This studys setting is the human resources profession, an entity that has embarked on two well-documented legitimation projects in the past 50 years. The first of these projects established a compliance-oriented role for HR as the interpreter and enforcer of workplace regulations. The second project has sought a strategy-oriented role for HR as a business partner to senior management. Ethnographic study of HR work reveals interaction patterns between HR workers and line managers that illustrate trap-like legitimacy dynamics. Despite HR workers efforts to legitimate a business-oriented role for themselves, line managers expected and continued to enact a compliance-oriented version of HR work to avoid having to handle messy, legally-freighted employee issues themselves. Theoretical and practical implications of the legitimacy trap concept are discussed."
2015,"Something Kind Of Groovy That I Wont Ever Do Again: Adventures and the Maintenance of Institution Adventures are social phenomena: from fairy tales to the Hunger Games, to Homer and to Edmund Hillary, we use them to test mettle and transmit values. Yet what do we really talk about when talking about Adventures? This exploratory paper uses a recently completed, first-ever row down the worlds most dangerous river to illustrate five necessary conditions of adventures. These conditions provide for three possibilities: a different experience of time, a different presentation of self, and the ability to willfully and temporarily suspend particular institutions. The latter of these not just implies a higher level of engagement with social institutions than commonly supposed but, when exercised, leads us to discover that, ironically, our very attempts to escape institutions temporarily (by means of adventures) often end up reproducing the very same."
2015,"The Ritual of Knowledge Transformation: Community Learning in Rural Ghana We analyze interactions among members of rural communities and agriculture development specialists. We find that these participants to the knowledge transformation process are separated by deep knowledge boundaries (syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic) as well as by opposing worldviews (one centered on community relations, the other on market relationships). In this context, knowledge transformation takes the form of ritualized interactions in which participative engagement, materiality, and ritualization strategies play important roles. In particular, community learning is facilitated by the use of two types of ritualization strategies: framing strategies (visiting dignitaries and events, praying, gift-giving) and recurring strategies (performing, fable-telling, affirming community values). These findings show that ritualization  understood as a way of acting that distinguishes particular situations from other, usually more mundane, activities  allows encounters between opposing orders and thus enables knowledge transformation. We suggest that this is the case because ritualization is performative in three respects: it speaks to peoples aspirations to change; it is morally redemptive; and it bridges across groups. Our study contributes to the literature on organizational rituals, learning in strong culture contexts, and economic sociology."
2015,"How Multiple Embeddedness Can Facilitate the Implementation of Institutional Change Research on institutional entrepreneurship views the position of actors across fields  a form of multiple embeddedness - as an enabling condition for envisioning new practices or norms. The results of this inductive case study show that actors located across two fields can leverage on such position to mobilize a broader set of allies, thus making more likely to create consensus about their institutional initiatives. This can be done through framing strategies that a) make the case of institutional change in one field relevant also for the other field, b) construct categories of actors that instrumentally associate actors in one field to actors of the other field. We aim to contribute to the literature on institutional entrepreneurship regarding how position across fields can be a strategic leverage for advancing institutional change."
2015,"Coping with Complexity: The Role of Boundary Organizations in Cross-Field Collaboration Collaboration among organizations from different organizational fields often results in significant institutional complexity that, if not managed effectively, may result in the failure of the collaborative relationship. One way that collaborating organizations deal with this complexity is to engage a special form of boundary organization to facilitate the collaboration. Using data from a multiple, comparative case study of three different types of organizations involved in technology transfer activities between universities and industry in Italy, we identify three strategies employed by boundary organizations to manage the complexity that arises in collaborations  deploying institutional boundary spanners at the individual level, mirroring institutional demands at the organizational level, and mediating institutional logics at the inter-organizational level  and discuss the interactions that occur among the different mechanisms."
2015,"Community Projects and the Mediating Role of Local Organizations The changing economic and social conditions of local communities influence important outcomes like crime rates and safety, health and educational attainment, and the provision of public goods. A related phenomenon that warrants scrutiny is the efficacy of what we call community projects, wherein community members come together to raise support and resources for specific causes. The performance of these projects is critical to addressing a range of issues like AIDS and breast cancer, homelessness and poverty. However, their collective orientation makes them vulnerable to the deterioration of structural factors within communities, notably changes in economic adversity, racial diversity, and residential instability. After showing empirically how these kinds of changes can hinder a communitys ability to effectively collectively identify and support specific causes, we turn to the mediating role played by local organizations in buttressing community projects. We propose that schools  more so than churches or clubs  are especially well-positioned to support these projects as community conditions become more challenging. We develop and test these insights in an analysis of how community changes over a 30-year span are linked to the performance of the localized campaigns that are part of the annual Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF program. The paper concludes with a discussion of the bridging and bonding roles that local schools play in supporting a range of important community projects."
2015,"How Managers Build Trust Through Their Control Applications This paper contributes to control-trust research by describing how the efforts managers make to demonstrate their trustworthiness (integrity, ability, benevolence) moderate the effects of managerial controls (output, process, social) on subordinate trust. We find that when managers more actively demonstrate their trustworthiness in ways that are aligned with the controls subordinates encounter, controls positively influence subordinate trust. Our survey of managers and subordinates indicates three primary relationships: when managers more actively demonstrate their integrity, applications of output control positively influence subordinate trust; when managers more actively demonstrate their ability, applications of process controls positively influence subordinate trust; when managers more actively demonstrate their benevolence, applications of social control positively influence subordinate trust. These relationships exist because when managers demonstrate their trustworthiness in ways that facilitate the achievement of performance objectives, subordinates are more confident that authorities are committed to protecting and promoting their interests. The paper concludes with a discussion about how these perspectives advance research on organizational control, organizational trust, and trust-control relationships."
2015,"Antecedents and Outcomes of Peer Control: A Multi-Level Analysis In this study, we develop a multilevel theoretical framework linking antecedents and outcomes of peer control, defined as coworkers at the same hierarchical level noticing and responding to their peers behavior or performance results. In particular, we examine hierarchical controls as antecedents of direct (i.e., monitoring and responding directly to peers) and indirect peer control (i.e., gossiping about and avoiding underperforming peers), as well as peer controls effects on individual-level and team-level outcomes. Analyzing data from more than 300 volunteers in more than 50 regional teams in a non-governmental organization (NGO), we find broad support for supervisory and clan control acting as antecedents of peer control and for peer controls effects on job satisfaction, but also counterintuitive effects of direct and indirect peer control on team performance. Our study complements and extends both the established literature on hierarchical control as well as the more recent, nascent literature stream on lateral or peer controls and their outcomes at both the individual and team levels."
2015,"Stretch Goals, Managerial Responses, and Performance Feedback Many academics, consultants and managers advocate the use of stretch objectives in the belief that stretch goals generate creative tension, motivate employees and yield superior performance. There is strong evidence to support this assertion on well- structured tasks in organisational psychology. However, the evidence is conflicting about whether stretch goals are effective on complex tasks. Furthermore, there is no evidence that stretch goals at the organisational level improve performance. Here, using a management simulation, we find that the level of goal stretch stimulates perceived risk taking, reduces goal commitment, decreases self-efficacy, and increases anxiety. Additionally, seemingly impossible goals (i.e., extremely stretch goals) have a negative effect on performance. Overall, stretch and seemingly impossible goals are a rule for riches for a few but not a rule for riches for all."
2015,"Information Asymmetry and Internal R&D; Organization In this paper, we draw on the information asymmetry perspective to explore firms choice of their internal R&D; organization, in terms of centralized versus decentralized R&D; structure. Using a unique dataset by matching the Corporate Tree of the Chinese listed firms with Chinas State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO), we find that firms with subsidiaries that heavily rely on the parent firms and with significant ownership control over their subsidiaries tend to centralize their R&D; activities within the parent firm, so as to overcome the coordination cost and the monitoring cost incurred by internal information asymmetry between the parent firms and their subsidiaries. We also find that firms that are farther than their subsidiaries to the national technology center and the consumer market are apt to delegate R&D; autonomy to their subsidiaries, in order to leverage the external information asymmetry to benefit from local knowledge."
2015,"The Poor Man's Guide to Paradox: Managing Dualities in Corporate Turnarounds Since organizational scholars have argued that resource scarcity accentuates dualities oppositional and relational nature, it remains to be explored whether and how resource-scarce firms can address dualities. Based on a longitudinal study of 107 Central European turnaround initiatives, we find empirical evidence that even resource-scarce organizations can successfully manage dualities. However, these organizations approaches to paradox resolution differ markedly from those previously described for organizations with abundant resources. Successful turnaround companies manage the duality between retrenchment and recovery by maintaining a biased balance within each stage of the turnaround process: while they combine the two activities, they concentrate on the most salient issues by focusing more on one activity than the other. Furthermore, they pursue a shifting balance throughout the turnaround process: while the retrenchment-recovery balance is biased towards retrenchment in the initial stage, the bias shifts towards recovery in the advanced stage. Scarce resources are thus targeted at addressing the most urgent needs at different points in time. Based on these findings, we contribute to the organizational paradox literature by developing a process perspective for managing dualities that integrates the synergistic combination and temporal separation solutions to addressing paradoxical tensions."
2015,"The Origins and Outcomes of Paradoxical Tensions: The Political Construction of ISO 26000 This study's purpose is to build theory on the antecedents and outcomes to paradoxes within organizational environments. To do so we have conducted a qualitative analysis of texts and participant interviews documenting how numerous paradoxical issues arose during the five-year development of ISO 26000: Guidance on Social Responsibility and how these issues influenced the environment. Our analysis revealed that the paradoxical issues experienced by participants in the standards development emerged from three sets of opposing yet interrelated motivations prevalent across organizational actors: pragmatism and idealism, conformity and independence, and fairness and advantage. Furthermore we found that the outcomes of paradoxical issues for the standard development environment could be classified into three categories: settlement, polarization, and exit. These findings suggest that the origins, and organizational actors experience, of paradoxical issues are within the motivations of organizational actors and that rather than leading to consensus among organizations, at the environmental level paradox can lead to dynamic and frequently political action among organizational actors."
2015,"Managing the Coordination Paradox: Introducing a Fragmentation Perspective in Crisis Management In organization and management theory coordination is primarily characterized by integration. A tautology is concealed in this approach: coordination is simultaneously the diagnosis of the problem and the way forward to resolve it. Yet, already for several decades empirical studies in crisis management showed that fragmentation is a prevailing phenomenon. Fragmentation emerges because ambiguous demands lead to a complexity of relationships and multiplicity of interpretations. Crisis management studies have shown that dealing with fragmentation is not only inevitable; it is a key characteristic of managing crisis situations. Therefore, we zoom in on how crisis managers from fire department, medical services, and police deal with ambiguity in field exercises, and will show that integration and fragmentation have a paradoxical relationship. By showing how fragmentation is not a deficiency of integration, but has features in itself that are necessary for coordination in fast- paced environments, our work generates a more complete understanding of the process of coordinating, in both the practice of crisis management, and for organizational theory in a broader sense."
2015,"Paradox Research in Management Science: The First 25 Years and the Next 25 Years We review 25 years of paradox research in the management domain. Content analysis highlights six research themes, which have received strongly varying research attention. Our review further suggests that the field has increasingly simplified the complex, often messy phenomena of paradox. While greater simplicity renders phenomena understandable and testable, oversimplifying complex realities can foster reductionist and incomplete theories. Hence, theory building has dual needs: simplicity (providing parsimony and pragmatism) and complexity (ensuring goodness of fit and completeness). We therefore suggest a future research agenda targeted at building a meta-theory of paradox, which returns to the fields rich roots in philosophy and psychology to tap into and capture the greater complexity of paradox. This future research agenda leverages the potential of paradox in a great variety of research streams in the management domain."
2015,"Attentional Agency and the Implementation of a Strategic Initiative We report findings from an in-depth single case study about a failed new venture initiative in a large firm that suggest that attentional agency (i.e. the exercise of discretion by managers over the distribution and allocation of attention of other organizational members) and the incompleteness of governance channels (i.e. the formal and informal mechanisms set up by managers to provide the necessary information to guide their attention) are key determinants of the distribution of organizational attention and behavior of organizational members. Our findings demonstrate the central role of individual discretion, as opposed to structural determinism, to organizational attention and behavior. They also suggest that attentional agency and incomplete governance channels may lead to incoherence in the implementation of a strategic initiative as well as a drift away from initial scope and objectives and languishing of the initiative, which may be countered by a focus on quality of attention. Finally, they highlight the crucial role of the quality of top management attention, rather than top management support per se, in determining the performance of a corporate venture."
2015,"Operational Governance: What Happens When Formalization and Flexibility Collide? We investigate the effects of operational governance formalization and flexibility on organizational performance. We draw from the organizational learning perspective to hypothesize a positive-increasing U-shaped learning curve effect regarding governance formalization and a positive effect regarding governance flexibility. Most importantly, we hypothesize that governance formalization and flexibility exhibit joint effects. Empirical evidence is based on 434 observations from project managers in a large multi-department government organization. We find that higher governance flexibility increases performance when formalization is low and decreases performance when formalization is high. Our finding that flexibility can be counter-productive to performance in highly formalized governance processes is theoretically novel. Overall, this paper contributes to the operational governance literature by clarifying how learning mechanisms explain the joint effects of governance formalization and flexibility."
2015,"The (Under) Performance of Mega-Projects: A Meta-Organizational Perspective This study links evolution in organizational structure to ambiguity in the definition of performance in the context of organizations formed to develop long-lived infrastructure: so-called mega-projects. Based on a longitudinal, inductive analysis of three mega-projects in London, we argue that a mega- project is a meta-organization with two symbiotically-related constituent structures. The core, led by a coalition, is a mutable collective that shares control over the goal of the project and corresponding high-level design choices. The periphery is a supply chain selected to design and build the infrastructure, but lacks the authority to change the high-level choices. As the mega-project structure evolves over time, we show that the founders and new comers renegotiate the high-level choices and slippages in performance targets ensue. The conflation of committals to different baselines, differing preferences for efficiency and effectiveness, and rivalry in high-level choices gives rise to competing performance narratives which cannot be reconciled. Thus, we argue, the disappointing and controversial (under) performance of mega-projects may be a result of how their organizational structure develops, rather than due to any agency or competence related failure per se."
2015,"Out of Bounds: Remaking Multiplex Boundaries in a Megaproject Drawing on an in-depth historical case study, I examine how boundaries are remade in NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, an infrared facility that was developed over three decades by two dozen organizations. Existing research treats boundaries as something that must be spanned, rather than something that can be changed. I extend the literature by revealing that boundaries are multilevel and malleable, and identify several mechanisms for altering the context of innovation projects. I contribute to our understanding of how to foster collaboration across diverse stakeholders in complex projects."
2015,"Disentangling Embedded Ties: How Liking and Trust Influence Partner Selection Individuals prefer economic partners with whom they have a pre- existing social relation, especially when faced with uncertainty and risk. Selecting counterparts one trusts provides a means of mitigating risk, while selecting counterparts one likes provides social utility. We disentangle the roles of liking and trust and examine their distinct influences on economic partner selection and fraud in two experiments in which buyers and sellers had asymmetric access to information. Individuals selected partners whom they liked when risk in the market was low, but prioritized trust when risk was high. Paradoxically, when vulnerable buyers selected partners whom they trusted, it did not insulate them from being defrauded. High betweenness centrality in the liking network protected buyers from fraud, indicating that structural characteristics rather than dyadic relations serve as social insurance against fraud."
2015,"Institutional Exploitation and Exploration: Socio-Spatial Distance of New Partner Selection Concepts of exploration and exploitation are widely used to interpret organizational behavior, typically classifying any new relationship as exploration and the continuation of an existing relationship as exploitation. This delineation from the organizational perspective, however, fails to differentiate between the relative socio-spatial distances of the two prospective partners. Arguably, these differences matter for the relative novelty of information that a new partner brings, not only to the organizational entities involved in the relationship, but to the institutional fields within which they are embedded. Conceptualizing novelty along a continuum of institutional distance across field boundaries, I develop a more robust theory of partner selection that distinguishes two types of organizational exploration: institutional exploitation, the initiation of a new relationship for the ego organization that involves the replication of past partner choices of others within the egos field, and institutional exploration, the formation of a relationship with a new organization that exists outside of the egos field. I test this theory using a novel, longitudinal dataset of U.S.-based foundations transnational grantee choices. I find that objective market- and firm-level uncertainty lead to institutional exploitation in new investment relationships. However, my analysis shows that exploitation is tempered by subjective perceptions of uncertainty rooted in the particular norms of an organizations institutional environment. Larger professionalized foundations often see novelty as opportunity, embracing institutional exploration and the selection of new partners from outside the field, while their less well-endowed peers view it as risk, resorting to institutional exploitation in an effort to form new partnerships that feel safer. Furthermore, foundations that respond to unique personal environments, such as family foundations and corporate foundations, engage in greater degrees of institutional exploration. These findings encourage the utility of including more nuanced degrees of exploration in future studies of partner selection."
2015,"Partner-Selection Effects on Venture Capital Investment Performance with Uncertainties This paper is intended to complement the existing literature on the performance of venture capital (VC) investments by presenting a multiple principal-agency framework for examining partner selection strategies aimed at mitigating uncertainties in the causes of investment performance and their boundary conditions. Using a dataset of VC investments from 1980 and 2008 in the U.S., we separated independent VC (IVC) firms and corporate VC (CVC) firms into two different datasets. We found that the existence of industrial and geographic uncertainties was shown to negatively affect the performance of IVC investments. Other things being equal, the preference for IVC firms as partners led to superior performance by CVC firms. However, from the homophily and resource perspectives, if various VC-specific uncertainties are considered to be contextual factors, one would expect CVC firms to be selected as partners by either IVC or CVC firms as a way to increase the probability of success."
2015,"Are Indirect Ties Always Helpful For Partnership Formation? Cohesion and structural equivalence arguments offer different predictions regarding the impact of indirect ties on new tie formation. The cohesion argument proposes a positive influence of indirect ties, while the structural equivalence perspective suggests a negative impact. Meanwhile, the empirical results are not consistent. This paper aims to reconcile the controversies in both theoretical and empirical fields by decomposing indirect ties into different types and investigating their impact on new tie formation in the context of multi-firm syndicates. Using Venture Capital (VC) syndication data 19852010, this paper finds that indirect ties through common third parties in the syndicate will facilitate new partnership formation, but indirect ties through common partners who are not syndicate participants will negatively influence new partnership formation."
2015,"Organizational Identification In Start-Ups: An Existential Perspective The literature on organizational identification (OI) predominantly considers established organizations, where OI is understood as membership. Less has been written about OI in organizations in their very earliest stages - start-ups. We view start-ups as an interesting case because start-ups cannot provide the same historical basis for attributions of identity, or conceptions of membership, as mature organizations; instead members are oriented to an imagined future organization. At the same time, founders and founder members can identify extremely strongly with start-ups, in part because they want to realize potentialities that can only come when starting a business from the roots up. Considering the case of OI in start-ups prompts a deeper consideration of OI and membership as existential phenomena. We do so using an existentialist perspective grounded in Sartre's Being and Time, which enables us to theorize the conceptual category of the start-up, and extend understanding of OI more generally, richly connecting identity, membership, and time."
2015,"Being Accountable Through Customer-Based Evaluations: Sensemaking, Power and Identity at Work This paper aims at gaining a better understanding of the new phenomenon of customer-based evaluations, that is, the system through which suppliers of a good or service are constantly and openly judged by those who buy this good or service and monitored by the actor who designed the system. Drawing on extensive fieldwork conducted at eBay, we investigate how business sellers react to the continuous flow of evaluations and power relationships that the evaluation system implies. We find that customer-based evaluations tend to damage sellers capacity to act and trigger discrepancies between their identity at work and the image of themselves that evaluations convey. We show that sellers engage in sensemaking processes (making sense of evaluations and power relationships) which enable them to pursue their activity, and in building a sense of coherence with their identity at work through identity work. Our findings highlight the diversity of reactions that enable individuals to continue their activity and defend their sense of who they are despite constant assaults coming from the imposed evaluation system."
2015,"Identity Liminality and Identity Work in a Reorganization This paper examines the process of reorganizing from a role identity perspective. I conduct a longitudinal inductive- qualitative study of reorganization at a social media company, where I trace the role identity evolution of 60 individuals over a two year period. I develop the concept of paradoxical identity liminality: a temporary state in which individuals simultaneously experience aspects of the role identity they have held so far (their past role identity commitments) and aspects of the role identity they expect to assume (their future role identity expectations). I find that perceived contradictions between role identity commitments and expectations cause individuals to feel high levels of cognitive dissonance. Attempts to resolve this dissonance trigger identity work in different directions and lead to three individual-level outcomes: (1) detachment; (2) adaptation; and (3) vacillation. My study suggests that vacillators, while still trapped in a state of paradoxical identity liminality, may positively influence the reorganizations outcomes by bridging unforeseen structural gaps that arise from the reorganizing process."
2015,"Oblivious Silence, Latent Memories and the Dislocation of Identity Narratives in an NGO This paper builds on Halbwachs work on collective memory to unpack an organisational Terra Incognita which is designated as oblivious silence. Oblivious silence and its corollary latent memories represent certain stories that were marginalized and ultimately obliterated from the collective memories of the organisation as the charity underwent a period of steep organisational restructuring. After delineating the particular organisational situation at HCH, the research further establishes links between the process of professionalization and the various mechanisms through which oblivious silence is produced. Finally, the implications of oblivious silence on workers self-narrative and identity are theorized."
2015,"A Multilevel Theory of Scandals in Organizations: Sex Abuse in the U.S. Catholic Church, 1971-2000 In this article, we attempt to build a comprehensive theory of the intra- and inter-organizational effects of scandals. In so doing, we develop and test distinct mechanisms regarding the effects of scandals on: 1) the focal organization; 2) organizations similar to it (bystanders); and 3) all organizations sharing the same form. First, drawing on the social identity theory literature, we argue that the damage incurred by the focal organization due to scandals will be contingent on its size. Second, we develop and test two competing hypotheses regarding the effects of scandals on bystander organizations: contamination, whereby organizations that are similar to the scandal-struck one are cognitively assimilated and penalized, and substitution, which would predict that similar organizations would benefit from the penalties suffered by the focal organization. Finally, we contend that scandalswhich we conceptualize as expressions of moral deficiency made public generate a shift in evaluation criteria which will cause audiences to place a premium on organizations that display features running counter to the scandals core features. A county-level study of religious adherence to the Catholic Church and sixteen other Christian denominations in the United States in the wake of sex abuse cases perpetrated by Catholic priests between 1971 and 2000 provides empirical support for our theory."
2015,"The Contingent Spillovers of Organizational Wrongdoing Organizations often get caught breaking the rules and violating societys norms. Research has shown that the effects of these wrongdoings often spillover beyond a transgressing organizations boundaries to other organizations that are considered similar. This paper extends this work by exploring to what extent different stakeholders punish organizations just based on similarity. Drawing on work in from social psychology, I hypothesize that stakeholders who are more deeply embedded in organizations through personal and emotional ties are less likely to be swayed by spillover effects. I test this hypothesis using a set of 43 nonprofits that were successfully prosecuted by the Attorney Generals Office in California between 2004 and 2012 for financial mismanagement. Nonprofits operating in similar categories and geographies were substantively harmed by these wrongdoings and earned 4.5% less revenue from goods and services they sell to their customers than comparable nonprofits. However, contributions from donors, who I argue are more deeply embedded in the organizations they support, were largely unaffected. These results suggest that embeddedness may be one way through which organizations can insulate themselves from the deleterious spillover effects propagated by the wrongdoing of others."
2015,"The Social Construction of Scandal: the Role of Media in the British Parliamentary Expense Affair We propose that the media has an active role in shaping how external audiences come to understand and make sense of a scandal, independent of the actual transgressions. We investigate the evolution of meaning and its effect on Members of Parliament (MP) resignations during the 2009 British Parliamentary Expense Scandal. We find broad support for the active role of media in socially constructing the meaning of a scandal. Specifically, we find that MPs who are featured centrally in the scandal narrative face increased pressures to resign. We also find that MPs who are structurally associated in the media narrative with other MPs who have previously resigned also resign at a higher rate. Finally, we find that the effect of an MPs level of wrongdoing is only significant when the MP is also featured centrally in the scandal narrative. Overall, we contribute to research on scandal by showing that an MPs treatment in the media is an important predictor of scandal outcomes."
2015,"Falling Stars: Celebrity, Wrongdoing, and the Fall from (and Return to) Grace Celebrity firms are those that attract a high level of public attention and generate positive affective responses from various stakeholder groups. Despite recent studies that explored the causes and consequences of firm celebrity, little research has considered how firms become infamous. This research attempts to shed more light on understanding the dynamic interplay among celebrity, infamy, and wrongdoing. By drawing on theories from the wrongdoing literature, we develop a typology of different types of celebrity and infamy that are categorized according to the audiences that celebrities address. Moreover, we explore how and why these celebrity firms may engage in wrongdoing by changing their behaviors, but also because of the changing norms, that cause an increase in firms infamy and/or diminishment in its celebrity. We further discuss how an infamous firm that fall from grace may reform itself and regain lost celebrity."
2015,"Legitimacy and Rhetoric: Chinese Cellular Phones This paper examines how Chinese shan-zhai entrepreneurs draw on various kinds of rhetorical strategies to build legitimacy and advantage. The research period is from 1998 to 2011, a period during which the shan-zhai industry grew from an informal and shattered one to a formal and competitive one. We emphasize three kinds of legitimacy  pragmatic, moral, and cognitive  that Chinese entrepreneurs need to ensure survival and growth. Grounded on a case study approach, we show that the process of legitimizing is strategically constructed as a sequence of steps: from pragmatic through moral to cognitive."
2015,"Cultural Entrepreneurship and the Role of Visuals in Interactive Frame Alignment Process We study visuals as fundamental ingredients to generate the emotional energy necessary for entrepreneurs to gain legitimacy. Through the analysis of the work of few entrepreneurs in creating an organization for coordinating the mobilization against plastic pollution, we develop a process model of the strategic use of visuals for legitimation consisting in two main steps: first, emotional equipment and; second, emotional alignment. We observe three strategies through which entrepreneurs legitimize their new frames using visuals: shock alignment, heroic alignment and iconological alignment. Theoretically, we aim to extend recent efforts in analyzing visuals in the cultural entrepreneurship process synthesizing institutional theory with framing and interaction sociology."
2015,"Firm Proposes, Community Disposes: Reacting to Social Barriers to Entry In this paper we draw upon literatures on impression management and social communities to examine a firms rhetorical responses to social contestation from the community, which the firm seeks to enter. Specifically, we examine negative claims as a complementary response to positive claims, which is considered a legitimation tactic by extant literature on firm rhetoric. We argue that in contrast to a positive claim, which draws attention towards the positive attributes of the firm, a negative claim is a delegitimation tactic that directs attention towards the negative aspects of a firms detractors in order to dissuade them from participating in the contestation. Further, positive claims seek endorsement from a broader set of external constituents but negative claims necessarily have a narrow focus because the target of the claim is a specific detractor. We develop our arguments and hypotheses to elaborate how this complementary and yet asymmetrical nature of the two claims becomes evident when the firm responds to contestation from within as well as outside the community it seeks to enter. Using data from the proposals for new LNG import terminals in the US from 2000 to 2013 and using longitudinal analysis methods we find support for all our hypotheses."
2015,"Its Not Only What You Say, But How You Say It: Investors' Responses to Cooperative Communication Guided by principle of cooperative communication, our paper theorized how the structure top managers earnings conference call communications would influence investors market responses. We tested our hypotheses with top managers presentations at firms quarterly earnings conference calls. The findings suggested that how information is communicated matters to recipients and influences their subsequent actions. Our study advanced knowledge about how external stakeholders draw inferences from top managers communications."
2015,"Fast-Paced Networks: How Various Forms of Social Capital Impact the Careers of Fashion Models In todays creative economy, social capital is understood to play a crucial role in enabling the creativity and careers of individuals in an ever-changing environment. But what kind of networksformal, informal, or other formsare the best-suited for this type of context? To answer this question we look at the networks that sustain fashion models careers. Using a unique comprehensive dataset of fashion models profiles and careers between 2000 and 2010, as well as in-depth ethnographic material, we distinguish between networks that can be formal (being affiliated to agencies), informal (belonging to national groups), or transitory (being in fashion shows). Each of these three types of networks has an important, yet distinct, impact on the ability of fashion models to reach the top of the fashion industrycurvilinear (inverted U) for formal relations, positive linear for informal, sigmoid for transitory networks made of disposable ties."
2015,"Employee Responses to Organizational Demise: The Influence of Network Embedding This conceptual paper considers how embedding in types of social network influences the employment-seeking actions of individuals affected by organizational demise. Three kinds of likely action, related to different embedding influences, are characterized: collective direct action, individual direct action and individual indirect action. The paper shows how decisions to engage in these forms of action are influenced by embedding in intra-organizational, professional and community social networks. Additional moderating factors that add a layer of complexity to social network influences on action are also identified and considered, in order to arrive at theoretical insights in the form of seven propositions. Practical implications and suggestions for further research that build on the theoretical insights are also developed."
2015,"Whats the Value of Social Capital? A Within-Person Job Offer and Choice Test Whether and how social capital derived through social ties creates value has animated substantial research in sociology, economics, and political science. Sociologists are generally inclined to believe that social ties have a causal impact on labor market outcomesthat is, it is who you know that counts to some degree. However, the evidence informing this belief is often inconsistent and circumstantial, thus requiring an indirect approach to inference. In this research we propose and test a model that addresses the limitations of prior research by leveraging unique data on contemporaneous job search with detailed information about job search channels and offer characteristics in alternative- specific job attributes and choice models. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find that search through social networks typically results in job offers with lower total compensation (e.g., -18.0% for those derived through referrals from family and friends v. formal recruiting, -15.4% for those derived via alumni referrals). However, offers derived through alumni contacts (weak bridging ties) are more likely to be accepted because they are perceived as having better growth prospects."
2015,"Antecedents of Employee Mobility between U.S. Reg. Commissions and the Private Sector, 1887-2000 Despite the high prevalence of the revolving door, a type of employee mobility between firms and their regulators, there is no clarity in terms of the antecedents of this practice. In this paper, I ask: What individual characteristics of regulators make them more likely to be hired away by (directly or indirectly) regulated firms? Using a unique dataset, containing career histories of regulators from 17 U.S. Independent Regulatory Commissions from 1887-2000, I find that both expertise and connectedness increase the likelihood of private sector employment post- tenure. In other words, revolving regulators present their new corporate employers with the potential for expertise exchange with the government, as well as for regulatory capture of the state. However, there are important differences across various types of firms. In fact, while professional expertise increases the likelihood of regulators exiting to directly regulated firms, law and consulting, as well as lobbying firms, regulatory expertise and connectedness only influence the likelihood of law and consulting firm employment."
2015,"Dancing with Names: The Dynamics of Perceptual Creativity in Diversification This paper brings the discussion of diversification into the symbolic-cognitive realm by examining how sub-category dynamics can be managed to enhance expert audiences creativity perception of the diversifier, or what we call perceptual creativity. We argue that when a parent firms tradeoff between legitimacy and distinctiveness in labeling offspring surprises industry experts, the perceived creativity in strategic decision- making creates a halo effect around the firms core business output. To test our argument, we identify two mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive semantic strategies: semantic autonomy, which refers to disaffiliating the parents and the offsprings names for intra-category differentiation, and semantic seeding, or affiliating the names for legitimacy spillover. Using unique panel data of high-end global fashion houses between 1998 and 2010, we find that a moderate amount of semantic autonomy enhances the perceptual creativity of the parents core business output (an inverted U curvilinear relationship), whereas semantic seeding consistently devaluates it. Furthermore, the focal diversifiers firm-specific characteristics, namely its social and financial standing in the market, moderate the main effects. These findings imply that although a conformity-differentiation tradeoff is inevitable when expanding into a new sub-category niche, the symbolic-strategic management of that tradeoff can lead to higher post-diversification creative performance."
2015,"Strategic Categorization: Vertical and Horizontal Changes in Self- Categorization This study extends prior research on categories and categorization by examining how organizations can strategically manage self- categorization labels to meet external audiences expectations and receive favorable evaluations. Specifically, by integrating the cognitive psychological perspective on categorization which emphasizes the vertical structure of categories, and the sociological perspective which emphasizes the horizontal structure of categories, I argue that organizations can strategically manage the degree of category inclusiveness and the number of categories spanned. It is further argued that the effect of strategic categorization on external audiences evaluation depends on the knowledge level of heterogeneous audiences and the prevailing theory of value in the market. I tested these ideas on firms in the Internet sector that went through the initial public offering (IPO) process between 1997 and 2012. As predicted, organizations that adopt more inclusive categories and fewer numbers of categories at IPO compared to pre-IPO are more appealing to investors. Further, the effect of strategic categorization differs among institutional and retail investors as well between the Internet bubble and post-bubble periods."
2015,"How do Nested Categories Influence Market Emergence? Evidence from Early American Music Records This paper theorizes and tests that an emergence of new market category depends on the diversity of the categories subordinate to it, and the acceptance of those sub-categories by audience influences the relationship. Categories in the market have a nested structure, in which the categories subordinate to a new category works as concrete examples through which audience make sense of the superordinate category. When a market category is nascent, then greater diversity among sub-categories below the nascent category can deter a formation of social codes for it, and thus can slow down the growth of the market for it. However, when audience can draw upon other product categories to make sense of the new product, then the diversity of its sub-categories can facilitate the market growth, because audiences tend to appreciate diversity in well-accepted products. I test these hypotheses using the unique data on a birth of the American music record industry between 1890 and 1928. Specifically I compared the evolution of the markets for classical recordings and for jazz recordings, because these music genres had strikingly different acceptance by audience in the beginning. However those acceptance had changed over time during this era. The contributions to the literature on market category, entrepreneurship, and industry emergence are discussed."
2015,"Analyzing the Impact of Hybrid Innovation on Firm Performance  While the Schumpeterian literature on innovation acknowledges recombination as an important source of novelty that advantages a firm, studies on market categories suggest that such hybridization triggers an illegitimacy discount, diminishing firm performance. Building on insights from both literatures, this paper posits that for a hybrid innovation to overcome the illegitimacy discount and benefit an innovating firm, reducing customers confusion over its technological deviations is crucial. Specifically, I propose that such confusion is mitigated when customers are of higher technological expertise, since experts are less easily disturbed by an innovations display of atypical features during evaluation. Furthermore, adopting a conventional product label for the hybrid helps to attenuate such confusion, as it distinctly suggests the identity of the innovation, making it more understandable to customers. I test these ideas using data from the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) industry in China between 1991 and 1996, where hybrid innovations concerned TCM products assimilation of Western medicine dosage form designs (e.g., tablets, capsules). Despite their clear functional advancements, I discovered that hybrid TCM innovations only induced market success for the innovating firms when being launched as prescription drugs whose immediate customers were TCM practitioners (i.e., technological experts), or when being labeled with traditional style names (i.e., conventional labels)."
2015,"Organizational Capabilities and Resources as Temporal Interplay In this paper we offer a perspective on organizational capabilities and resources which helps explain their mutual interdependencies shaped by the passing time. Pursuing grounded theorizing we show how stochastically occurring dynamic capabilities rely for their exercise on cyclically occurring operational capabilities and on the continual existence of resources. We show how these three temporal properties of capabilities and resources are present in the Ulstein Group, a world leader in the design and construction of vessels for the offshore industry. We then show specifically how, during the development of the x-bow, a path-breaking design that enabled strategic renewal, dynamic capabilities were leveraged through temporal interplay with operational capabilities and resources. The analysis enables us to suggest a two-tier temporal model of capabilities and resources consisting of patterns of response cycles and development cycles."
2015,"Tea Time: Temporal Coordination for Sustainable Development Prior research on temporal coordination has focused on social rhythms that are created and modified by human action. The temporal patterns of biophysical rhythms, which are not as easily controlled, are not usually discriminated from social rhythms. The temporal coordination of biophysical rhythms relative to social rhythms is particularly relevant to the issue of sustainable development, which requires managing the flows of resource needs and resource availability that are deeply embedded in the rhythms of the biophysical environment. Through a multi-sited ethnography of eight Fairtrade-certified tea producing organizations within the rural communities of Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, we examine how collective organizing unfolds to coordinate the flows of needs and resources for sustainable development. The findings suggest that Fairtrade interventions unintentionally disrupted resource flows in the very communities they sought to help, because they ignored the social and biophysical rhythms. Tea producers, on the other hand, organized to coordinate the flows of needs and resources by recognizing and responding to the interconnectedness of multiple social and biophysical rhythms. Our study highlights the importance of coordinating, rather than seeking to control, time for organizing in pursuit of sustainable development."
2015,"The Hypothetical Past: Focusing Agency through Narratives of Past, Present, and Future Although management scholars have paid more and better attention in recent years to the history of the organizations and fields we study, we have only begun to examine the ways in which our narratives of the pastas well as the present and futureaffect both change and stability. In this paper, I study the temporal narratives of the first one hundred thirty years of the public library field to determine if and how these narratives are used to deal with changes to the field. In the process, I explore how actors use these narratives to support and direct their agency in dealing with changes, whether to support or defend against them. I find that the links between history and identity allow actors to open space for change via reinterpreting narratives of the past as well as narratives of the future, but that these narratives appear to be more effective when they match the temporal mood of the era in which they are related."
2015,"A Critical Analysis of Temporal Work: Time, Space and Identity in a Global Engineering Firm In this paper, we critically analyze the concept of temporal work wherein individuals are said to act agentially by reimagining the future, rethinking the past, and reconsidering the present. We argue that the link between temporal work and agency is influenced by two other concepts  space and identity. To explore these relationships, we draw on an empirical study of temporal work in two divisions of a global engineering company. Our findings show that when individuals engage in temporal work they also construct space and that it is the intersection of time and space that influences the scope of agency. It is, therefore, is more accurate to talk of spatio-temporal work. We then examine the influence of identity on the link between temporal work and agency by examining aged identities. We show how the meanings ascribed to age are related to how time and space is constructed, in ways that can both enable or constrain agency. Our study challenges the idea that temporal work alone constitutes human agency but, rather, the key to understanding agency comes from exploring the relationship between spatio-temporal work and identity work."
2015,"Public and Family Firms FDI: Patterns and Performance Implications of Legitimacy Seeking Behaviors This study traces differences in firms internationalization patterns to the influence and expectations of different stakeholder groups. Drawing on institutional theory and the family firm literature, we theorize about how internationalization strategies are influenced by peer activity and delineate different types of legitimacy seeking, and accordingly more or less opportunity seeking behaviors. First, the longitudinal data reveal that in contrast to private family firms, publicly listed firms follow investment decisions of their most legitimate peers. However, when family firms are also publicly listed, they face a need to elicit favorable legitimacy judgments in the market. Under such conditions, family-owned firms notice and imitate the behaviors of an idiosyncratic peer group which consists of family-owned competitors. Second, empirical evidence suggests that subsidiaries of private family firms outperform subsidiaries of publicly listed firms whose internationalization choices are influenced by legitimacy seeking. Theoretical and practical implications for all three types of firms as well as public policy are discussed."
2015,"Community Values, Family Firm Governance and Performance: An Ecology of Institutional Logics The literature on family firms is divided. Some scholars argue that the parochial socioemotional wealth goals of family actors detract from firm financial results; others maintain that family priorities of stewardship reduce agency costs. Scholars have attempted to reconcile these positions by focusing on the governance arrangements of these firms. We take a different tack, arguing that the institutional environment in the geographic communities where family firms operate can have a profound impact on the performance of family-based governance. That environment is characterized by a blend of family and market institutional logics. We argue that where parochial family logics dominate and market logics are weak, the nepotism of family intensive governance may compromise financial results; where the reverse is true, family advantages of stewardship will fail to materialize, and where both logics are strong, the best of both worlds may prevail  family stewardship enlightened by market discipline. We test and support these and related notions in a sample of 2,344 firms in 20 distinct geographic regions in Italy, each characterized by different blends of logics. The role of human agency is proposed to be a critical moderator of institutional influences."
2015,"How Entrepreneurial Orientation Promotes Superior Firm Performance in Family and Nonfamily Firms The relationship between entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and family governance has gained increasing attention in entrepreneurship and strategy literature. This study investigates how EO influences firm performance in the contingencies of family and nonfamily firms by considering the influence of family ownership, family management, and family control. Family management refers to the presence of family CEOs and family top management team; while family control refers to the presence of family chairpersons and family directors. Based on the data of public firms in Taiwan, this study confirms that EO is positively associated with the return on assets (ROA) and Tobins q of family firms, but in nonfamily firms such an association is insignificant. This study furtherly finds that the positive association between EO and firm performance is particularly strong when family CEOs, family top managers, and family directors are in presence. Overall, the results suggest that the profit impact of EO is more likely to be promoted when family ownership is combined with family management and control."
2015,"The Fruits of Passion: The Effect of Entrepreneurship on Life Satisfaction of Family Members In this paper, we take a family embedded perspective to investigate the intertwined relationship between entrepreneurship and family. We argue that the involvement of family members in a family business has important consequences for the business family. Involvement can pose a burden on members and thereby contribute to dysfunctional families and businesses. We formulate hypotheses about four forms of involvement: (1) direct involvement through self-employment, (2) indirect involvement through living with a self-employed relative, (3) direct and dependent involvement through working for a relative, and (4) family-level involvement in terms of the proportion of available work time that family members work in the business. We explore empirically how these forms of involvement affect family members' life satisfaction. We use a comprehensive dataset that spans over 28 years. We find that family business involvement has positive effects on the life satisfaction of the entrepreneur, while it has negative effects for the other members of the family. Entrepreneurship is a mixed blessing in terms of life satisfaction of family members."
2015,"Borrowing on Reputation: The Role of Social Ties in Syndicated Lending From the 1980s to the year 2000, the market for syndicated loans  defined as multiple banks forming a group to lend to a single borrowing firm  grew in value from $20 billion to in excess of $1 trillion dollars. Despite the importance of this market as a source of funding for business, little research appears to consider how social ties affect the borrower's loan terms. Building on network theories of governance, this paper focuses on the social mechanisms underlying the marketplace for syndicated loans. In this study I assume that both repeated transactions and board-level interlocks imply social ties between organizations. I hypothesize that social connections between borrowers and lenders act to reduce information asymmetries by allowing for more accurate information about the true quality of the borrower to be exchanged. Furthermore, I hypothesize that when lead banks invite lenders with which they have historically had significant dealings into a syndicate, it is a signal of the creditworthiness of the borrower and will be associated with better loan terms. I empirically model predicted loan terms for public, non-financial borrowers using syndicated loan data from 1999 to 2003 and find support for these hypotheses. This work highlights not only that social networks can convey important information about corporate reputation but also that the structure of these networks can be interpreted as signals of reputation. For practitioners these findings are important to better understand the syndicated loan marketplace and assist in developing strategies to obtain optimal terms on syndicated loans."
2015,"Network Structure and Uncertainty: The Role of Strong Ties in Venture Capital Funding Networks Network-related outcomes are organized into several distinct theoretical classes of causes and effects based upon the network structure these ties suggest. The differences in these classes imply fundamental shifts in the efficacy and valence of the outcomes associated with distinct types of ties. We argue that which stream of network effects dominates depends highly on the environment an actor resides in. In environments that are uncertain, unstable, and whose market interactions and outcomes involve a greater degree of risk, strong ties provide benefits above and beyond ties of other types, such as weak ties. The mechanism underlying this process occurs as network actors build strong working group relationships that develop trust, build routines, and facilitate exploration in the face of uncertainty. The cofunding networks of venture capital firms illustrate that strong ties built through repeat collaboration on startup firm co-investments explain the successful outcomes of startup firms. In particular, this process is most prevalent when the environment is uncertain."
2015,"Closure and Social Capital: A Complete-Network Interpretation Colemans theory of social capital describes large populations of actors where high-value trades occur without formal insurance or contracts, and certain actors that hold key positions within this social structure have the greatest social capital and the highest outcomes. Egocentric closure, the extent to which an actors contacts are connected to each other, explains these effects within a triad. More complex complete-network structural configurations explain these effects in larger populations and also enable us to capture the second positional element of Colemans theory. But can complete-network structural configurations predict actor-level performance? In the context of an economy-wide network of Indian firms, we find that firms within such closed structures, and especially those holding core positions, have superior performance and greater access to credit."
2015,"Networks and Creativity in Context: A Meta-Analytic Exploration of Contextual Contingencies Theoretical explanations of how networks impact creativity differ and the corresponding empirical evidence is mixed. Structural holes, tie strength, and network prominence have both positive and negative effects on creativity at different levels of analysis. Recent research recognizes the importance of examining the impact of contextual factors to understand these contradictory findings. We further this line of research by proposing that contextual elements generate normative pressures that are either injunctive or descriptive in nature. We argue that when the pressures are injunctive, network elements will be more conducive to creative if they match contextual pressures; on the other side, when the pressures are descriptive, network elements will be more conducive to creativity if they complement the requirements of the context. Building on this reasoning, we develop hypotheses on the contingent effects of cultural tightness, industry R&D; intensity, and whole network density. To test our ideas, we use a meta-analytic approach that accounts for differences in construct definition and operational measurement, levels of analyses, and empirical methodology. Analyses reveal that all three factors moderate the relationship between different network elements on creativity, providing us with a fine-grained explanation of network effects on creativity. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed."
2015,"Identity Alignment in the Inter-organisational Relationship: The Case of Open Access Organisations routinely participate in inter-organisational relationships such as mergers & acquisitions, conglomerates, networks, business alliances, and industry associations. However, our understanding of how these relationships affect organisational identities remains limited. To address this issue, we study how members construe their organisational identities and those of other key organisations they have relationships with, and how this construal influences the implementation of innovative practices. We examine how members of an academic university press in the UK made sense of both their own organisational identities and those of their parent university, sister organisations and competitors; and how this affected the implementation of the Open Access publishing model. We offer a relational view of organisational identity and develop a process model of organisational identity alignment in inter-organisational relationships."
2015,"Organizational Identity Change in Cross-Institutional Contexts This paper draws on an in-depth longitudinal investigation of organizational identity change within a business firm that became increasingly embedded in long-term partnerships with UK hospitals, education authorities and schools over a 12-year period. The study illustrates how becoming embedded in a new institutional environment can lead a business firm to develop a more complex hybrid organisational identity wherein utilitarian and normative self conceptions begin to co-exist. The grounded model of identity change presented in this paper illustrates how this process of identity change unfolded along two interrelated paths which encompass purposeful leader-led identity work at the centre of the organization  e.g. institutional bricolage, identity claiming, symbolic acts  and naturalistic changes at the boundaries of the organization  e.g. identification with public service partners goals and processes of institutionalization. When combined, these mutually reinforcing process encouraged a radical shift in members collective self conceptions. The findings advance our understanding of organizational identity by delineating how organizational identity change can occur in more complex institutional environments."
2015,"Narrative Strategies for Contextualizing Ventures: Constructing Organizational Fields Research on identity work exposes how managers use narrative strategies to construct their ventures identity as normatively appropriate yet strategically distinctive in the context of their organizational field. However, existing studies focus predominantly upon the venture-centric component of identity work, thereby reducing the ventures external context to either a static control variable or a clean slate ready to be defined by agentic managers. As such, we have limited understanding of how managers might strategically construct their external environment to contextualize their venture in identity work. We address this gap by exploring the narrative strategies of venture contextualization by managers at multiple different ventures seeking to build business around electric vehicle technologies in Finland. We find that in direct contrast to incumbents, managers at newcomer ventures construct highly discontinuous narratives of environmental change that manifest the discursive construction of a nascent organizational field. In this way, entrepreneurial managers can employ contextualizing narrative strategies to circumvent the institutional pressures and inter-organizational comparisons in existing environments, thereby attracting attention to their venture and espousing an increased capacity for agency. However, this compromised their subsequent ability to build a comprehensible identity for their venture. Our study contributes to existing theory by exposing previously overlooked narrative strategies of venture contextualization, and contributes novel insights to the use of history in identity narratives and the discursive construction of field-level ambiguity."
2015,"Muddling Through: Identity, Culture and Decision-Making in Managers' Responses to Uncertainty As organizations evolve and respond to environmental changes, they often enter a period of indeterminacy. Their leaders may grasp that legacy routines and capabilities no longer fit a changing environment, but they may have only partially decided on a future direction. How do senior managers, who are charged with carrying out day-to-day work, navigate this uncertain period? This study uses fourteen months of ethnographic data in a large, well-established digital agency to induce a theory of how senior managers interpret and act upon organizational uncertainty in their everyday work. First, I find that uncertainty posed identity problems as managers struggled to make sense of both the distinctive character and the categorical role of the organization. Second, I find that uncertainty posed evaluation problems in everyday work as members struggled to make decisions without clear organizational reference points. In the absence of a clear identity, I find that managers relied on a sense of shared organizational culture to make decisions by compromise, avoidance, or default. The shared culture provided a diffuse sense of collective coherence even while decision-making practices perpetuated uncertainty about the organizations future. The process of affirming who we are while perpetuating uncertainty about what we do is a process of organizational adaptation that I call muddling through."
2015,"Paying Attention to Misconduct: Differential Reactions to Misconduct After Sarbanes-Oxley One of the big questions following the enactment of new corporate legislation is whether it is effective in altering firm behavior. In this paper, we push this question further to investigate how legislation might be effective in altering firm behavior, independent of the coercive nature of legislation and enforcement. We study the impact of the Sarbanes- Oxley Act of 2002 on the behavior of publicly traded firms restating earnings. We find that Sarbanes-Oxley does generate a change in behavior, such that firms are much more likely to take costly remedial action  in the form of firing the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer  in the wake of a restatement after the legislation was enacted than they were before. We also find that Sarbanes-Oxley redirects media attention to the problem of restatement, and that this media attention is itself associated with more costly remedial action. Finally, we find that media attention partially mediates the effects of the legislation on firm response, suggesting that it is the redirection of attention, rather than the legislation itself, that changes organizational behavior. This conclusion is further supported by a regression discontinuity analysis, which reveals a change in firm behavior even for those organizations not yet subject to the terms of the legislation."
2015,"(In-)Coherence in Dealing with Rule-Breaking There are different types of rule-breaking. While rule-breaking can be essential for organizations to act flexibly and innovatively, rule-breaking such as corruption can constitute a threat to organizations as it gives rise to liability. This study examines how organizations deal with different types of rule-breaking. I address this question by drawing from a multiple-case study analyzing how seven firms design and enforce their internal anti-corruption rules. My findings reveal that organizations construct the meaning of anti-corruption differently in relation to what constitutes and how to distinguish rule-following and rule-breaking. These observations first lead me to identify two approaches to how anti-corruption rules are designed. Depending on the chosen type of rule design, rule-breaking is either more or less likely to occur. Second, I identify four approaches to how firms deal with rule-breaking. Which approach is adopted depends on the chosen type of rule design and whether the organizations deal (in-)coherently with rule-breaking. My findings show that the firms utilize missing concrete requirements in anti-corruption laws to assess the legality of actions and thus to differentiate between acceptable and unacceptable rule-breaking to ensure flexibility. Lastly, my findings highlight potential organizational effects of these different approaches on the functioning of the firms."
2015,"Stick or Yardstick: Peoples Reactions to Social Control Agents Normative Enforcements This article examines how people react to companies misconduct. Building on Beckers (1963) seminal work, we distinguish two types of norms: rule-based and value-based norms. Unlike value-based norms, rule-based norms can be translated into specific behavioral guidelines. Therefore, there is less uncertainty around them and it is easier to determine when these norms are obeyed or violated. Using the entire population of UK citizens complaints against corporate advertising to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA)  the official control agency in the UK  between 2006 and 2010, we study how people react to ASAs decisions (banning vs. clearing an advertisement). The results show how peoples reaction to ASAs decisions depends on the type of norm  rule-based norms vs. value-based norm  whose (presumed) infringement is being evaluated. Our study brings people and their voice to the fore as a crucial audience in the study of social norms and organizational misconduct. It also highlights the importance of looking at different types of norms as a moderator of this relationship."
2015,"Does it Matter if Stockbrokers Get Caught Cheating? Consequences of Misconduct on Careers This analysis investigates the consequences of misconduct on the careers of U.S. stockbrokers. The basic expectation is that, besides official penalties, individual-level misconduct results in reputational damage and impaired future labor market opportunities. However, the consequences of misconduct seem mild on Wall Street where misconduct could be perceived by employers as a sign of aggressiveness or a cost of doing business. To address this ambiguity, we investigate the career consequences of one form of Wall Street misconduct where stockbrokers cheat their customers by generating higher fees through conducting unnecessary, unsuitable, or unauthorized transactions. Specifically, we examine whether visible instances of misconduct are associated with higher/lower likelihood of exiting the profession and being able to leave ones current employer. We also examine whether a stockbrokers tenure moderates the consequences of misconduct as misconduct may be a weaker signal to the market the more experienced the stockbroker is. We use the records of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) which include stockbrokers employment history and any involvement in formal disputes with customers. We measure misconduct as disputes resulting in settlements or restitution payments to customers. Our sample includes 4,810 stockbrokers randomly selected from FINRAs population of 1.3 million stockbrokers with employment spells at 1,940 brokerage firms during 1980-2013. Using robust linear probability models and accounting for individual, firm, and time unobserved heterogeneity, we find that stockbrokers with recent misconduct suffer negative labor market consequences. Particularly, stockbrokers who experience settlements or restitution payments are 3.7% more likely to exit the industry and 15.4% less likely to be able to change employers over the next three years than those without such judgments. We also find that higher tenure appears to weaken these negative consequences of misconduct. Ongoing analysis will help us refine and expand our findings and inform regulatory policy in the securities industry."
2015,"Casting Call: The Expansion of Actorhood in U.S. Firms, 1960-2010 Organizational scholars today routinely refer to firms as actors. In contemporary uses, the term conveys identity, sovereignty and the capacity for purposive action. Understood in this way, the conceptualization of the firm as a social actor is significant in that it diverges from descriptions of the firm as, for example, a legal fiction that is the aggregation of individual interests via a web of contracts or merely a vehicle for powerful owners to achieve their goals. In this paper, we draw on a content analysis of 300 annual reports from a sample of 80 large U.S. public firms to examine changes in the extent and nature of actorhood portrayals among businesses between 1960 and 2010. Our examination of how firms presented themselves in their annual reports indicates that societys view of firms as actors both expanded and qualitatively changed during this timeframe. We find that firms increasingly depicted themselves as entities with values, agency and responsibility on a growing range of social and economic issues, all of which are consistent with modern notions of actorhood. This transformation corresponds to broader cultural shifts, such as the trend towards managerialism and the explosion of hard and soft law. Overall, we show that institutional pressures do more than provide a set of institutional constraints for embedded agency: More fundamentally, cultural shifts constitute firms as actors."
2015,"The Use of Institutional Logics as Cultural Resources by Social Enterprises Employees There has been an increasing concern with the complexity created by the presence of multiple institutional logics (Friedland & Alford, 1991; Thornton & Ocasio, 1999) within organizations. Multiple logics are seen as competing and creating conflicting demands to organizations and individuals with negative consequences, hence the focus on managing them suggested by many articles. This paper attempts to provide a more interpretivist perspective, re-connecting the institutional logics perspective with its symbolic aspects and microfoundations. To do so, this exploratory study looks at the unique case of an organization establishing itself as a community interest company (CIC), while coordinating eight social enterprises in different industries. It analyses employees accounts about the organization and its transition from the Third Sector to understand how logics are used as cultural resources to construct meaning inside their organizations. In doing so, it provides insights that can help us understand the key role of individuals and the interplay between institutional logics and narratives."
2015,"Institutional Logics as Flexible Resources-How Coca-Cola Uses Community Logic to Respond to Obesity In this paper, we draw from a toolkit view of institutional logics and examine the use of logics by organizations as flexible strategic resources. We do this by analyzing how a logic already adopted by an organization can be used to respond to new external pressures so as to maintain the status quo. Empirically, we focus on a very topical social issue, obesity, and examine how the leading beverage company uses the community logic, a logic it has built around a symbolic community and successfully used for decades to support the dominant market logic, to respond to the obesity-related demands placed on it. We identify four different mechanisms by which logics can be flexed so as to accommodate new expectations but still continue to support the dominant goals of the organization and thus maintain stability."
2015,"Reframing Organizations as Service-Based: A Cognitive Perspective to Hybrid Organizations Research on hybrid organizations combining multiple institutional logics has gained currency in organization theory. Yet, existing studies offer limited insights into the diversity of hybrid forms, particularly ignoring the influence of framing, or the construction of the schemata of interpretation, by managers promoting hybrid organizational forms. Building on qualitative data from the residential sector, the present study explores the diverse ways in which managers frame the goals and practices of their organization to justify a growing orientation to residents welfare and service-based business logic extending beyond the traditional, production-centered logic of the residential field. The findings identify three approaches to framing: extending the prevailing collective frame, combining rationales from multiple frames, and creating new frames transcending institutional conflicts. These produce distinct consequences for the organization."
2015,"Gray Matters in the Growth of Markets We explore the role of organizational origins and legal form for the subsequent growth and performance of firms in 18 sub-Saharan African countries and find that formalization at the start of operations contributed to both higher sales and greater employment among registered firms. At the same time, informality is associated with lower variance in firm performance. The size of the informal sector, perceptions of bureaucratic corruption, and general economic growth moderate these effects. While informality deters firm growth within countries, the relationship between the size of gray markets and larger economic growth across countries appears to be non- negative. We discuss some implications of these findings for firm growth in emerging markets."
2015,"The Genesis of Innovative Ventures: A Founding Team Imprinting Perspective Researchers, leaders, and policy makers herald new ventures as the engine of economic growth, renewal, and innovation - yet new ventures vary widely in their ability to innovate. We argue here that new venture innovativeness stems from the imprinting influence of founding teams. Specifically, a founding teams human capital provides a motive force and a reservoir of knowledge that shapes the intensity with which new ventures search for new markets and knowledge. We suggest that this influence is not transitory, and that founding team human capital - through its sculpting influence on new venture search routines - has an imprinting effect on new venture innovativeness. We test this mediational imprinting hypothesis and find that the greater the founding teams stock of general and specific human capital in the year of founding, the greater a new ventures level of innovation in the growth phase. Further, we find evidence to suggest that search intensity represents a potent mechanism for transmitting the imprinting influence of founding team human capital from the past to the present."
2015,"Locked-In Working Time Regimes: Exploring Barriers to Change in a Management Consulting Firm This paper reports the findings of a longitudinal case study that traces the emergence and gradual perpetuation of the long working hours regime of an elite management consulting firm over a period of thirty-two years. Whereas extant research has highlighted the need for changing culturally embedded patterns of extraordinary long and inflexible hours, it has not sufficiently illuminated why, despite the numerous organizationally supported change efforts, consulting firms working time regimes remain ultra-stable. What are the hidden barriers behind this surprising persistence? Drawing on the theory of organizational path dependence, this paper suggests that in order to understand how to change a working time regime, one first needs to examine in more detail the drivers of its ongoing persistence. In particular, we identify two self-reinforcing dynamics that have driven the formation and continuous stabilization of the working time regime studied. These findings contribute not only to explaining the puzzling persistence of working time regimes but also to current debates about organizational stability and change (i) by advancing a processual view of organizational path dependence and (ii) by highlighting the need for a more dynamic understanding of organizational stability."
2015,"Fly on the Wings of R&D;: Path Dependence, Creation & Separation Literature concerned with the process of organizational path emergence is split in those approaches focusing on external triggers and those emphasizing the role of agents to shape a firm's trajectory. In order to integrate these contradicting views, we build on the results of a longitudinal qualitative single case study. Our findings shed light on the interplay of internal and external factors that lead to the creation and constitution of a new path. We followed the process of how the new organizational path of FACC - an aircraft composite component supplier - arised from the existing organizational path of FISCHER - a skiing company - in the 1980s. By analyzing the self- reinforcing processes that add to the divergence of the two paths over time and finally lead to their path separation, we contribute to recent calls to focus on self-reinforcing processes as the core of path dependence theory. By introducing the concept of path separation, the findings also provide an alternative to the upcoming approaches of de-locking and path breaking, which were criticized to deny the path dependence' basic assumption that lock-in as a definite state."
2015,"Imitation or Innovation? Exploring the Determinants of Crowdfunding Success What is the relationship between imitation, innovation, and new field legitimation? This paper sets out to explore the returns to imitating other organizations in field during the formation and legitimation stages, and the relationship between these returns and the level of experience of resource- holders in the field. We propose that although novel ideas receive resources as a field emerges and becomes established, less original organizations gradually gain attention from resource holders; and that, while recombinant types of innovation are rewarded resources, these resources are more likely to come from less experienced resource-holder, because experienced resource-holders are more likely to invest in organizations focusing on a single issue. Lastly, we suggest that later-entering resource holders are more likely to respond to organizations following the rules of engagement in the newly formed market. We test these hypotheses using data on education and small business campaigns from a large online crowdfunding site. This study has implications for understanding field emergence, variation in success strategies over time, and the role played by early- versus later-stage investors in the success or failure of these strategies."
2015,"Imitation? Environmental Signals and Similarity of Behavior in Hiring by Japanese Firms, 1974-2011 Organizations often undertake take similar behaviors. The observation of the phenomenon is usually interpreted as a sign of imitationorganizations refer to each other and behave in the similar way. However, similarity of behavior can occur without reference to otherfs behavior: it can occur when organizations look at the same signals and consequently take similar behavior. Developing theories about environmental signals and socialization in organizational decision-making, we introduce two concepts of gprimary signalh and gsecondary signalh and explicitly distinguish the two different mechanisms generating organizationsf similar behavior. Then, drawing from recent literature demonstrating the conditional nature of environmental signals, we explore the conditions under which each type of signals will be most relevant. We test our theory using a 38-year panel of annual hiring of graduating students by about 400 large Japanese firms. Our analyses show that organizations often imitate peers, yet at the same time they react to the other common environmental signals. Further, the magnitude of the two mechanisms in organizational decision-making is not constant but rather varying depending on the situation organizations face."
2015,"Dynamic Capabilities and Shaping Markets: Beyond Market Exogeneity and Organizational Adaptation Although a remarkable number of works in the field of research on dynamic capabilities have highlighted the relevance of devoting attention to market-shaping capabilities, there has not been any systematic attempt to include such a perspective into a consistent theoretical understanding. We explore a key reason for this divide: by reconstructing the underlying assumptions embedded in the field of research on dynamic capabilities, we reveal that the field still conceives markets as an exogenous context factor that organizations can hardly influence. Accordingly, the field concedes little scope of action beyond adapting to exogenous market changes to organizations. Inspired by early critiques raised against contingency theories in organization research and works in adjacent disciplines, we revisit the assumption of market exogeneity and argue that organizations may not only adapt to market changes but may also endogenously shape markets to a certain extent. The explicit consideration of market endogeneity not only provides a necessary corner stone for research on market-shaping capabilities but also has broader implications for the overall concept of dynamic capabilities and for further empirical research in that field."
2015,"Competing in Design: Differentiation, Imitation, and Value Capture  We propose a unifying framework for the role of visible product design as a driver of inter-firm competition, covering aspects of both value creation and value capture. Drawing on various theoretical perspectives explaining the demand-side effects of design, we theorize how design choices (i) affect consumer preferences through different modes of differentiation, (ii) act as a moderator of psychological processes involved in comparative evaluations, and (iii) may collide with demand-side norms regarding imitation. We also introduce a formal model that allows us to analyze and illustrate the conditions under which similarity or dissimilarity to a competing products design is likely to be most beneficial. In highlighting the competitive, hitherto largely neglected, role of design, we corroborate its much-vaunted strategic relevance and unveil additional levers for creating competitive advantage."
2016,"Lost in Transition: Organizational Practices and Formal Employment of Women in India This paper develops and empirically evaluates a theory explaining womens persistently low labor force participation in developing economies. I argue that lo- cal organizational practices affect labor force participation by influencing whether first-time women workers successfully transition into formal employment. I examine the effect of one organizational practice, the assignment of different trainers to women joining a large garment factory in India, on whether the women sustain their employment. Using a combination of archival, survey and ethnographic data and exogenous variation in trainer assignment, I find that women assigned to experienced trainers are 20% more likely to remain employed after three months of entering the workforce than women assigned to inexperienced trainers. I show that experienced trainers impact womens transition into formal employment not by imparting job-related skills or organizational identification, but by inculcating work readiness skills needed to survive at work including self-presentation, interpersonal communication, work-life separation and self-reliance. This paper contributes to our understanding of female labor force participation in developing economies by problematizing womens transition into formal employment, illustrating the role of organizational practices and uncovering the mechanism of work readiness affecting womens transition to formal work."
2016,"Discursive Mechanisms of Categorization: Consumer Debt and the Reproduction of Gender Inequality We examine how gender inequality is reproduced through categorization processes in mainstream discourse. Drawing from an analysis of six years of US media coverage of credit card borrowers throughout the recent financial crisis, we show how categorization processes create dichotomies between social actors in ways that reproduce inequalities between them. Specifically, we find that credit card borrowers are dichotomized along gender lines according to their capability as borrowers. We highlight two discursive mechanisms through which this categorization occurs: accounts of savviness and responsibility, and vocabularies of agency. Our central contribution is an in-depth analysis of the micro-processes of categorization involved in the reproduction of gender inequality. In doing so, we offer new insights into the relationship between categorization and institutional processes and about institutional maintenance and reproduction more generally."
2016,"In the Name of Executive Success: An Examination of First Name Popularity and Executive Compensation Research has shown that the nature of an individuals name can have a significant effect on their success in life. In this study, we examine if these implications persist among top executives of corporations. In particular, we examine whether the popularity of an executives first name has any bearing on his or her compensation. Using a dataset of 9,569 executives, we find a U-shaped relationship, with executives receiving higher compensation when their first names were very popular or when their first names were unique, but lower compensation when their first names had just average levels of popularity. We also find that gender moderated this relationship; that is, the effect of name popularity and uniqueness on compensation was even stronger for female executives than male executives. Finally, we explore the effects of gender ambiguous names on executive compensation and here too find more significant effects for female executives than male executives. Our findings offer insights into how executive success, especially for women, may be affected not just by how executives perform but also by impressions of their personal attributes."
2016,"Managers Political Ideology and Gender Inequality within Organizations Political science research provides strong evidence that political ideology (e.g. liberal versus conservative) has an important influence on how individuals view gender roles in economic life. We provide the first comprehensive examination of how these preferences influence organizations. We develop theory that explains why conservative managers may have higher rates of gender inequality in the training, promotion, and turnover of their subordinates. We also theorize that conservative managers will be less likely to lead their firms diversity initiatives. Using novel microdata from the legal services industry, we find support for the majority of our arguments. We discuss the implications of our findings for individual careers and firm performance."
2016,"Bringing The Boss Politics In: Supervisor Political Ideology And The Gender Gap In Earnings Managerial discretion plays an important role in shaping ascriptive inequality in organizations. Building on recent research showing how supervisor discretion can bias worker rewards, we document how supervisors political ideologies are brought into the organizational context to influence the gender earnings gap among subordinate workers. Using detailed longitudinal data from a large law firm, combined with records of political campaign donations, we find that the gender gap in performance-based pay is greatly reduced for those workers tied to liberal supervisors, relative to conservative supervisors. Further, this political ideology effect on earnings varies greatly with worker organizational tenure. We also provide evidence on the robustness and underlying mechanisms contributing to the supervisor ideology effect. This research contributes to our understanding of the determinants of the gender earnings gap, by providing theory and evidence on the effects of supervisor political beliefs on that gap. It appears that in settings where managers have discretion over worker rewards and careers, their personal political beliefs (while rarely discussed in the open) have an important influence on outcomes for male and female workers."
2016,"How social capital affects innovation: Exploring the role of bonding and bridging social capital. We focus on a group of firms that share the same norms, beliefs and values to analyse how bonding social capital (i.e. internal links within the group) and bridging social capital (i.e. links with actors outside the group) affect innovation based on content analysis of qualitative data. We find that bonding and bridging social capital affect different phases of the innovation process: bonding social capital supports the implementation of innovation and bridging social capital favours the initial phase of idea generation. We conclude that innovation results from the interplay between different types of social capital and that each type contributes in different and unique ways to the final outcome."
2016,"Performance Feedback and Firms' R&D; Frequency: A comparison between SOEs and POEs Leveraging the behavioral theory of the firm (BTF), the study examines how performance feedback affects firms R&D; investment frequency in the context of Chinas emerging economies. Our findings show that historical and social performance feedbacks induce different R&D; investments frequencies. Specifically, firms tend to stop R&D; investments when performing better than historical aspiration, but tend to make continuous R&D; investments when performing worse than historical aspiration. In contrast, firms incline to continuously make R&D; investments when outperforming social aspiration, but tend to stop making R&D; investments when performing worse than social aspiration. The study also compares the effects of performance feedback on R&D; investment frequency in SOEs and POEs. Our findings show both commonality and inconsistencies between the two categories of firms. Both SOEs and POEs will stop R&D; investments when encountering negative social performance feedback, but will make continuous R&D; investments when encountering negative historical performance feedback. However, they take different R&D; investments frequencies in situations that performing better than historical aspiration and performance better than historical aspiration."
2016,"The Staff Within The Line: The Enabling-Yet-Unsung Work of Staff Employees in Product Development In this paper, I explore the work of internal consultants within the engineering unit of an aerospace multinational. Drawing on thirteen months of ethnographic fieldwork and employing a practice theory toolkit, I map the labor invested to create, sustain and sponsor tools and services to improve product development processes. I conceptualize these activities as representative of a (modern) staff function and explore their relevance in our current economy where knowledge flows and expert work are central to organizations. The study adds depth to debates on the enabling role of staff workers in bureaucratic structures and advances our overall understanding of this organizational function. Keywords: bureaucracy; internal consultants, management innovations, product development, staff professionals."
2016,"Experimental spaces and institutional innovation: distancing work and anchoring work This paper explores the role of experimental spaces in processes of institutional innovation. Our case study is of the institutionalization of carbon markets in Europe, where dominant industrial actors built experimental spaces to alleviate the institutional pressures that constrained their ability to develop new solutions. We find that experimental spaces are the product of two forms of institutional work: distancing work and anchoring work. The interplay of distancing work and anchoring work generates specific conditions inside experimental spaces that catalyze the development and institutionalization of new solutions. We also highlight the pragmatic mechanisms of theorization held inside experimental spaces."
2016,"Wiring domains. Metaphors in distributed knowledge generation This paper analyzes how metaphors facilitate the development of new ideas and coordination of actors in a distributed process of knowledge generation. Metaphors guide agents with distant knowledge to reframe key concepts and anchor them to the material context of their activities, triggering practices which remain independent and domain specific, but maintain reciprocal coherence. Through the lens of metaphors, we analyze a case study of a pioneering project in nano science that combines knowledge from chemistry, neurophysiology and electronic engineering. We reconstruct how metaphors contribute to generate new problem setups, coordinate partners activities and interact with specialized laboratory practices over multiple phases of the project. We contribute to extant theories on metaphors and distributed collaborations: We advance a formal framework to interpret the interplay between the cognitive and practical worlds, whereby metaphors are the buffer and mapping, anchoring and triggering are the three identified mechanisms that allow coordination and knowledge generation. We show how metaphors facilitate the coordination of distributed work in the absence of extensive knowledge transfer, preserving the local specialization of groups."
2016,"Origins of Organizational Stigma: A Quantitative Analysis In this paper, we contribute to the organizational stigma literature by identifying the conditions under which an organization is stigmatized. While organizational stigma is often defined in synonymous terms with instances of organizational transgression, we argue that organizational stigma does not simply result from a particular transgression per se. A transgression is only the first condition for stigmatization of the focal organization. The second necessary condition for stigmatization is the attribution of the transgression to the organization as a whole. The attribution of the transgression to the organization as a whole, in turn, is claimed to depend on the number of organizational members involved in the transgression. Using a sample of 216 alleged corporate fraud events and a network measure of stigma, this study finds that stigmatization of the focal organization increases as the number of organizational members indicted in the fraud lawsuit increases. Moreover, contrary to the expectations, the magnitude of the fraud and the salience of the corporate fraud in public discourse had no significant association with stigma. Keywords: Organizational stigma; negative social evaluations; corporate fraud; transgression"
2016,"The stalled theorization of a legitimately distinctive collective identity The theorization of a legitimately distinctive collective identity that balances conformity to established norms and differentiation from relevant others is important to the success of social actors. Prior studies examining such efforts have tended to focus on new ventures or emerging collective actors crafting de novo identities that are unencumbered by past experiences and social evaluations. Consequently, we know little about how actors whose collective identities are spoiled by past experiences engage in reinvention. Our inductive case study shows that actors in the Ontario wine region were unable to establish a clear, stable and unique collective identity because they were hobbled by consciousness of a conduct stigma and immutable material constraints. By focusing on how these specific factors impeded actors from envisioning identities, we recast theorization work as not only the framing of a newly minted set of practices into a compelling format, but also as an iterative negotiation of the meaning underlying practices and their reconciliation with pre-existing conditions and experiences."
2016,"Friends in Low Places: Examining Board Interlock Formation after Financial Restatements Management research has examined how potentially stigmatizing events may impact firms reputations, undermine the careers of their directors and executives, and force them to pursue actions to regain organizational standing. Prior work has not shown how such events may impact the ability of firms to build much-needed interlock ties with external organizations. In our study, we examine the impact of financial restatements as events that could lead to significant stigmatization or loss of organizational reputation. We examine the evolution of the network of board interlock ties among Fortune 500 firms during the 2002-2008 period. We use SIENA, a program for the statistical analysis of dynamics of social network tie formation that permits longitudinal analysis of tie formation while accounting for dynamic changes in behavior and characteristics of network nodes. We find that firms experiencing financial restatements are less likely to have their current directors receive invitations to join outside boards, they are more likely to avoid new ties with other restatement firms, they tend to draw on reciprocal ties and ties with higher status external firms, and they often maintain existing interlocks when their ties are currently embedded in transitive network structures involving multiple external firms. Our work contributes to the understanding of the processes of organizational tie formation under conditions of stigma or loss of reputation."
2016,"A Stigmatized Categories Approach to Diversification: The Market Premium on Unrelated Diversifiers Using a social-categories perspective, we identify contingencies under which chemically unrelated diversifiers may exhibit better performance than chemically related diversifiers. This contradicts one of the main implications of a resource based view of diversification. We consider chemicals that firms use in their manufacturing processes as unique and independent categories, and conceptualize chemically unrelated diversifiersi.e., firms operating in industries that use completely different chemicalsas category spanners. Consistent with prior work, we propose that stock analysts and investors will offer weaker support to those firms that straddle several chemical-level categories and thus exhibit an incoherent identity. However, we also claim that if and when chemical-level categories become stigmatized, chemically unrelated diversifiers will suffer less negative valuations from stock analysts and investors. Essentially, we argue that, in a context of stigmatized chemical-level categories presenting an incoherent identityi.e. spanning multiple chemical-level categoriesand being ignored as a result becomes a positive advantage. In addition, we explore how firms suffering from such categorical stigma purposely decide to enter new chemical-level categories (unrelated diversification) as a way to diffuse their identities and thus place themselves under the radar of sanctioning audiences."
2016,"Waiting to Inhale: How Medical Cannabis Entrepreneurs are Destigmatizing their Industry In this study, I take an inductive approach to understanding how entrepreneurs in the core-stigmatized medical cannabis industry are attempting to increase audience support and remove the stigma that is associated with their enterprises and industry. Prior studies have shown that core-stigmatized organizations generally do not try to remove their stigma, but instead try to manage it by hiding it from disapproving audiences (Hudson & Okhuysen, 2009; Vergne, 2012). Alternatively, organizations can use the stigma to attract the support of those with similar values, and if the stigma is based on specific organizational practices, they can alter those practices to align with audience expectations (Helms & Patterson, 2014). However, we know little about the process of stigma removal, particularly when the stigma is not associated with a specific practice, but is instead derived from a generalized negative perception of the category of goods being traded. 	I contribute to the growing literature on organizational stigma by showing that organizations can reduce core stigma through a process of morality infusion. They use narratives and substantive actions to tie their industry and firms to an alternative set of values, creating an identity and image that resonates with critical stakeholders. Through this process entrepreneurial firms build moral legitimacy, a key antecedent to destigmatization (Hudson, 2008). As such, this study also has practical implications for entrepreneurial firms, particularly those in emerging industries that must often contend with resistance from varied audiences."
2016,"Where does Innovation Start From?: The Effects of Field Characteristics on Innovation Diffusion Many studies that examined where innovations diffuse from in an inter-organizational field found conflicting results; some found innovations diffuse from the periphery while others from the center. This paper proposes a theoretical framework that predicts the origin of innovation diffusion based on the effects of field characteristics on the legitimatization process. It claims that the relative cost of illegitimacy, which is affected by field characteristics, might promote or constrain differentially central and marginal actors tendency to innovate or to adopt innovations. It suggests five propositions that predict how field characteristics might affect patterns of innovation diffusion."
2016,"Can Mindful Firms be Innovative? Differentiated Impact of Organizational Mindfulness on Innovation Building on the theories of organizational attention and learning, this study investigates the differentiated impact of organizational mindfulness on different types of firm innovation. We contend that the emphasis of organizational mindfulness on attention to the present and to the connectivity of multiple surrounding elements can result in the different impact of organizational mindfulness on innovations with a high or low degree of novelty. Specifically, we propose while organizational mindfulness has a positive relationship with innovation with a lower degree of novelty, there exists an inverse U-shaped relationship between organizational mindfulness and firm innovations with a higher degree of novelty. Results based on a combined dataset of archival data and a survey data of about 350 Chinese firms support our hypotheses. This study is one of the first studies to explore the impact of organizational mindfulness on firm innovation and it further advances our understanding on mindfulness, organizational attention and organizational learning."
2016,"Innovation: The Roles of Intellectual Capital, Knowledge Augmentation and Environmental Dynamism Prior work suggests that intellectual capital plays a critical role in organizations ability to succeed at innovation, that is, to create new and better products or services efficiently. However, little research has examined how intellectual capital translates into innovation success, and whether all forms of intellectual capital are needed for innovation success across industries. I hypothesize that intellectual capital affects innovation success through knowledge augmentation, and that the degree to which different forms of intellectual capital facilitate knowledge augmentation, and innovation success in turn, varies with industry dynamics. In a multi-industry study, I found support for my hypotheses: core forms of intellectual capital human, organizational, and socialwere positively associated with knowledge augmentation, which in turn was associated with innovation success, as indicated by innovation quality and efficiency. In a second study, deliberately conducted in an industry facing higher environmental dynamism than those in the first studypharmaceuticalsI found that only human capital was positively linked to innovation quality and efficiency through knowledge augmentation. Organizational capital had no effect and social capital had a negative effect on innovation success in the pharmaceutical industry. I discuss theoretical and practical implications of the findings for innovation and knowledge use."
2016,"Time and organizational routines: Synchronizing contradictory temporalities in innovative projects The role of contradictory temporalities in interconnected routines is understudied despite the pervasiveness of organizational routines. We trace asynchronous design- and production-oriented routine actions in innovative videogame projects. Actors performing the exploratory design routine developed the overall interactive experience of the game. Temporally, these actors faced pressure to iterate quickly with little concern for the quality of their outcomes. Production-oriented actors built the virtual components of the game. Temporally, these actors faced pressure to complete the game and iterate slowly to avoid errors. Our findings reveal how these contradictory temporalities generated asynchronous routine performances that undermined game completion. We also found that mundane actions enabled synchrony. Specifically, actors accomplished synchrony by cueing and bounding flexible routine actions to selectively alter the pace of routines according to immediate priorities. These mundane actions created a dynamic truce, suggesting that participants can enact contradictory temporalities in ways that impact the potential for conflict, and how that conflict can be enacted though routines. Overall, we show how routines with asymmetric temporalities can be coordinated through mundane but strategically important action, thereby demonstrating how routine actions can be a generative source for balancing contradictions in creative work."
2016,"How Can Serendipity Be Made To Benefit Problem Solving? Findings From Drug Repurposing Based on an inductive study of drug repurposinga systematic effort by large pharmaceutical companies and specialized smaller firms to find new medical indications for existing pharmaceutical compoundsthis paper identifies and explores emerging methods employed by firms to increasingly benefit from serendipitous discoveries in problem solving. Drug repurposing is an exemplar of a highly interesting and novel problem solving practice that breaks with the conventional rational approach to drug development historically favored by the established firms. Our preliminary analysis of the novel methods shows that problem solving in drug repurposing unfolds as a matching process among a set of solutions (existing compounds) and a set of needs (indications). Based on our findings, we offer a theoretical model linking serendipitous discoveries to the search for novel and valuable uses of existing knowledge assets within and across organizations. The model contributes to the integration of theories on knowledge reuse and value creation from idiosyncratic resources, as well as to the literature on serendipity and need-solution pair problem solving in organization studies."
2016,"Where Do Broker Relationships Come From This study investigates how broker relationships emerge to bridge otherwise disconnected market actors. I specify conditions under which sellers willingly pay brokerage fees and accept to be brokered: (1) when sellers arrive unusually late in their first matching events, (2) when they engage in matches with a large number of investors and with a large size of investment, and (3) when they engage in matches with investors having prior matching experience with sellers assisted by brokers. These conditions are hypothesized and tested in the context of the venture capital market in which law firms emerge to participate in the investment deals as specialized mediating agents between start-ups and venture capitalist firms. In sum, this study enriches our understanding of how, why, and when broker ties emerge in economic systems."
2016,"Divide et Impera: Conflictual Ties in Broker Relationships Much of the recent research on brokerage has its theoretical foundations in the work of Georg Simmel. In his seminal essay on the triad, Simmel distinguishes between three forms of brokerage: the non-partisan broker who reduces conflict in the triad, the tertius gaudens broker who benefits from the lack of connection between the alters, and the divide et impera broker who actively creates or sustains conflict. Yet, most studies to date have been somewhat selective in their borrowing of ideas from Simmel and have either failed to single out divide et impera as a separate form of brokerage or considered it as a special case of tertius gaudens. In this paper, we argue that divide et impera is a distinct broker category that relies on different network resources and involves different forms of agency by the broker. Specifically, we argue that tertius gaudens brokers draw upon trust and status to engage in relational agency, which focuses on creating and maintaining open triads. In contrast, divide et impera brokers draw upon dependence and network vision to engage in structural agency, which focuses on introducing conflict into triads to actively change the existing network structure. We test these ideas on a sample of broker relationships in the biopharmaceutical industry and obtain support for our theory."
2016,"Big fish or big pond? Seller's dilemma in intermediary selection As is widely observed in many market settings, sellers collaborate with intermediaries to commercialize products and to reach buyers. Sellers typically prefer intermediaries that have great market accessthat is, intermediaries that can reach many buyers. But sellers also prefer a high relative standing in an intermediarys portfolio, so that they (rather than other portfolio sellers) receive most of the intermediarys attention and resources. These two preferences often conflict: Intermediaries with great market access also tend to represent more and stronger sellers, making a high relative standing more difficult for a seller to achieve. Thus, sellers often need to choose either a high standing and few buyers (big fish, small pond) or a low standing and opportunity to reach many buyers (small fish, big pond). We term this the big fish, big pond dilemma. We examine how sellers resolve this dilemma through a study of intermediary selections of 377 video game developers and 175 video game publishers over a 10-year period. We find that the sellers choice tips towards many buyers when the seller has more experience, and towards a high relative standing when the competitive overlap with other sellers in the intermediarys portfolio is high. We contribute to the literatures on seller- intermediary collaboration, the nature of competition and cooperation, and broadly, network evolution including how the decisions of seemingly minor actors can influence this evolution."
2016,"Internationalization & Partnerships: Exploratory Search across Institutional & Product Boundaries International expansion entails boundary-spanning search behaviors to draw upon new knowledge in institutional and product domains. To effectively confront with challenges of exploration in these two domains, a firm may span organizational boundaries by accessing relational resources of foreign partners. Our paper examines the role of relational resources in facilitating (undermining) the institutional and product exploration strategies in the course of international expansion. We argue that due to disparities in the nature of institutional and product explorations, reliance on relational resources has asymmetric impact on performance consequences of these two strategies. Whereas reliance on relational resources furthers the benefits conferred from exploration in the institutional domain, benefiting from product exploration in foreign markets stands on reducing the dependence on relational resources and maintaining unmediated contact with host markets. Empirical results based on 206 exporting firms in three emerging economies support our theorized relationships."
2016,"Leveraging commercial and knowledge network experience, opportunity and network position The aim of this study is to investigate the formation of bridging ties  ties that bridge previously unconnected network components. Specifically, we investigate the drivers of bridging ties in the context of relational pluralism and the possibility to leverage a firms prior bridging tie formation experience, the opportunity to form relations and prior network position from one network (i.e., knowledge network) to another network (i.e., commercial network). Our study of firms in the German biotechnology industry between 1996 and 2012 reveals that it is possible to leverage prior bridging tie formation experience and a firms central position in the knowledge network to form future bridging ties in the knowledge and the commercial networks. However, it is not possible to leverage these drivers from the commercial network to the knowledge network. In addition, the opportunity to form bridging ties in the knowledge network increases the formation of future bridging ties in the knowledge network but decreases the rate of forming future bridging ties in the commercial network and vice versa. Our findings show that it is important to take the content of a tie into account when studying the possibility to leverage network resources from one network to another and offer a more refined understanding of bridging tie formation in the context of relational pluralism."
2016,Hierarchical Inconsistency and Corporate Securities Fraud: Evidence from Chinese Family Business Hierarchical inconsistency refers to the structure in which people are simultaneously embedded in two hierarchies indicating inconsistent rank orders. I argue that hierarchical inconsistency in the corporate elite group performs as an emergent scrutiny system to reduce corporate securities fraud. This scrutiny effect is only significantly observed when institutions and social norms that legitimize both hierarchies are strongly impactful. I find evidence to support these arguments in the context of Chinese family business by comparing family firms in which the chairperson has to lead his/her senior relative(s) in the corporate elite group with other family firms.
2016,"Elite controversy and the institutional change of China's stock market How does elite conflict at the broader societal level influence the development and change of a focal field? Based on a historical analysis of three major public controversies among Chinese elite intellectuals regarding Chinas stock market, and drawing from the theory of strategic action fields and discursive institutionalism, I show how the field of the state interacted with the field of the intelligentsia to shift the dominant presumptions about the stock market at critical historical junctures. My analysis highlights contentiousness and the rhetorical construct of presumption as key to understanding elite conflicts and fragmentation. I also explain how controversies get settled and exert differing effects on the rules and structures of fields."
2016,"Inside the Black-Market: Managing and Maintaining Competing Institutional Logics in a Shadow Field This article explores how competing institutional logics are incorporated and maintained in a shadow institutional field. Relying on a qualitative case study, we investigated the counterfeit luxury industry in Guangzhou, the most renowned counterfeit business hub in China. We show that, instead of organizations managing competing logics internally, as the previous literature suggests, the competing institutional logics were incorporated through a special field structure and associated practices, and maintained by consistent legitimacy work. This study further illustrates how a shadow institutional field can survive and thrive under legal pressure by carrying out innovative practices, which established business could learn from and apply in their formal business."
2016,"Aspiration Performance and Corporate Illegality: An Empirical Examination In this study, following Hu et al.s (2011) three-reference-point model we build the argument that a firms performance relative to aspirations is curvilinearly associated with the likelihood of its illegal activities. Specifically, when the firms performance is below the aspirations, the relationship between relative performance and corporate illegality is inverted U-shaped. However, when the firms performance is above the aspirations, this relationship is U-shaped. Empirical results based on Chinese listed companies largely support our predictions. Specifically, when the performance is below the self and social aspirations, the relationship between relative performance and corporate illegality is inverted U-shaped; while when the performance is above the social aspiration, this relationship is U-shaped. This study not only provides direct evidence for the three-reference-point risk preference, but also deepens our understanding on the performance-illegality relationship and its underlying mechanisms."
2016,"Institutional Change in Authoritarian Settings: A Study of Environmental Penalties in China We examine institutional change processes in authoritarian settings and hypothesize about how different types of institutional pressure can spur governmental action with regard to firms environmental performance. Authoritarian regimes pursuit of maintaining legitimacy and retaining control is the key mechanism that shapes the efficacy of institutional pressures directed at the state. We test our conceptual model using a unique dataset of environmental penalties of Chinese publicly listed firms from 2007 to 2011. Our analyses reveal that in China, the pressures stemming from the agency of individuals or groups are less effective than pressures without individual agency in influencing governmental responses to corporate environmental issues, and discontinuous institutional pressures have less impact on governmental responses than continuous institutional pressures. We further identify key local factors such as the local governments organizational capacity and local economic privatization that moderate these relationships. Overall, these findings demonstrate that, in authoritarian settings, institutional pressures that raise attention to issues are more influential when they do not directly challenge the regime. We discuss how our findings contribute to understanding processes of institutional change, outcomes of social movements, and the evolution of environmentalism."
2016,"Interorganizational Coordinating for Reliability: An Ethnography of a High-Reliability Network Increasingly, organizations face the necessity to operate reliably, not only within but also across their boundaries. Research on high- reliability organizations has stressed how organizations coordinate to cope with such goals while also remaining responsive to unexpected events. Still, the lack of hierarchical fiat that characterizes interorganizational networks constitutes a challenge and calls for alternative mechanisms and practices at the network level. This paper addresses this research gap with a practice-based exploration of a high-reliability network (HRN). Derived from ethnographic fieldwork, our findings provide the ground for a practice-based framework for coordinating HRNs. The study contributes to the body of research on organizing for high reliability in networks by uncovering how informal structures of coordination, developed for reliability purposes across organizational boundaries, are enacted and reproduced by three institutionalized practices  reducing distance, staging coordination and adjusting collective performance. The study thereby sheds light on a network-specific reliability principle: anticipation of accountability."
2016,"Network Leadership and the Dynamic Effects of Dominant and Coequal Structuration Patterns In this paper we seek to understand the dynamics of leadership in inter-organizational networks, understanding network leadership as reflexive structuration. Using comparative longitudinal data from two healthcare networks, we analyze (1) the practices underlying effective network leadership and (2) how the dynamic interplay of these practices shapes the evolution of network structures over time. The analysis shows that effective network leadership is dependent on a repertoire of practices for mobilizing distributed expertise, enabling a productive learning dialogue and creating reflection-friendly political structures. In addition, it reveals two structuration patterns, a dominant and a coequal pattern, with a different impact on the evolution of network structures. With this study, we enhance our understanding of the possibilities and limits of reflexive network development and add to a dynamic perspective on network leadership."
2016,"Developing new Collaboration Practices and Role Structures in Inter- organizational Projects This paper addresses how multiple organizations in inter- organizational projects achieve coordination in embedded settings while pursuing new role structures. While each inter-organizational project is unique, projects are also embedded in wider industry structures and processes that enhance coordination. This paper adopts a practice perspective to analyze the emergence of coordination practices in two inter-organizational projects: a traditional one and one where the existing role structure was deliberately redesigned. The traditional role structure was more vulnerable to disturbances, which actors dealt with largely implicitly. The newly designed role structure allowed for more flexibility in dealing with disturbances and relied on creating visibility through explicating assumptions and implications. However, attempting to change these role structures created a new challenge as the actors outside the focal organization, lacked common understanding, which reduced predictability. While the previous literature on inter- organizational coordination practices has emphasized how stability is achieved, our findings illustrate the challenges in reshaping such practices and in initiating learning across organizations."
2016,"Institutional Frames and Collaboration Expectations in Hybrid Interorganizational Partnerships Our research is concerned with the role played by expectations in hybrid interorganizational collaboration projects. In particular, we look at how organizations participating in multi-party cross-sector partnerships negotiate broad and ill-defined metaproblems set by policymakers to carry forward heterogeneous goals about the partnership. We used a process-perspective derived from the sociology of expectations to empirically study a hybrid partnership in which public and private actors came together with the broad goal of supporting regional innovation and creating and managing a new science park. In particular, we found that the ambiguity of institutional frames gave room to the proliferation of partners expectations about the collaboration. Such proliferation was driven by a clash between the pile-up of goals and commitments in relation to the main project of the partnership -i.e. the design of the science park- and the materialization of the project itself -i.e. the realization and use of the science park. Instead of admitting difficulties in making the science park function properly (i.e., managing the clash) our actors continuously alimented their positive expectations about the collaboration thanks to a rolling announcements strategy that constantly pushed expectations further into the future. We offer contributions to a better understanding of collaborative dynamics in hybrid partnership failure by surfacing the negative power of expectations, the dual role of materiality as collaboration enabler and constrainer, and the interplay between broadly defined institutional frames and the proliferation of heterogeneous goals within hybrid partnerships."
2016,"A tale of two levels: the diversification of business groups Why do widely diversified business groups continue to prosper in the face of local institutional improvements and globalization? In this paper, we identify the value creating potential of the business group as an organizational form by examining the diversification of business group at two different levels: the group and the member firm. At the group level, we argue that business groups enter key industries with linkages to many other industries to maximize provision of critical resources to their member firms. At the member firm level, we propose that the business groups diversified portfolio rationalizes its member firms diversification patterns and promotes potential synergies among member firms without the need for costly governance mechanisms. Our empirical tests based on data for 30 major Korean business groups and their 108 member firms provide support for the ideas."
2016,"Collaborative by Design?How Matrix Organizations See/Do Alliances We investigate how a firms internal organizational structure influences the types of interorganizational partnerships the firm forms and the outcomes associated with these partnerships. Our specific focus is on examining the differences in the types of partnerships and their outcomes for firms with matrix organizational forms relative to those with other organizational forms. Matrix structures facilitate intra-organizational coordination, knowledge- sharing, and conflict management across boundaries  three practices that are central to interorganizational partnerships as well. We propose that matrix organizations internal collaborative practices enable them to better mitigate a priori concerns about relationally complex and risky interorganizational partnerships, and to more effectively manage these partnerships than non-matrix firms. We hypothesize and find empirical support for matrix firms tendency to enter into more complex and more challenging alliances. We also find, however, that matrix firms universally experience a performance penalty for those alliances. We discuss the rationale for this double- complexity discount."
2016,"Organizational Design, Information Tacitness, And the Contingent Benefits of Structural Holes How do the organizational designs employed by firms and the tacitness of information in their networks impact the benefits that firms gain from occupying structural holes? Structural holes theory proposes that firms achieve superior performance when their networks are optimized for brokerage positions. However, the empirical literature examining this effect has produce mixed results, indicating potentially critical limits in the theoretical assumptions upon which structural holes theory is built. In this paper, we refine structural holes theory by identifying two problematic assumptions, which imply that firms will equally benefit from structural holes regardless of their internal designs or the types of information present in their networks. In contrast to these assumptions, we propose that a firms organizational design and the tacitness of information in the network both influence its ability to access, absorb, and synthesize diverse network information. As a result, the relationship between brokerage and firm performance depends critically on the internal designs employed by firms and on the types of network information available, as well as the development of the networks where firms operate. These ideas are formalized and explored using an agent based simulation model."
2016,"Open organization with future perspective: Garbage can model revisited This study examines whether an open organization really facilitates problem resolution. In an open organization, autonomously acting members (including potential ones) can freely participate and collaborate in decision-making, regardless of their affiliation, rank, or other factors. The open organization has been generally considered to facilitate problem resolution under uncertainty and ambiguity. However, the Garbage Can Model of organizational decision- making argues that the more open an organizational structure, the more it hinders problem resolution. The purpose of this study is to conduct an agent- based simulation based on the Garbage Can Model in order to clarify the conditions under which an open organization facilitates problem resolution. The study also examines the validity of simulation results by a questionnaire survey of Japanese sales organizations, which are confronting uncertainty and ambiguity in their markets. The results show that the effect that an open organization has on problem resolution changes depending on its future perspective. In other words, problem resolution can be facilitated in an open organization with a future perspective, but hindered in an open organization without it."
2016,"Micro-institutional Change and Organization Design: A Process Model of Logic Elaboration We develop a process model of logic elaboration from a case study of a China-based financial training company. Based on 8 years of real time observations and interviews, we theorize how a firm steeped in a professional logic endogenously initiates a micro-institutional change to elaborate on its professional logic by incorporating elements from a market logic. The findings suggest that recognition, experimentation, articulation, and infusion are the key processes that underlie logic elaborations. Our study contributes to literatures on institutional change and organizational design by documenting empirically how a dominant logic could enable actors to incorporate an alternative logic through organizational design."
2016,"Creating a Polycentric Commons to Govern Strategic Choice in Pluralistic Projects This study explores the governance of strategic choice in pluralistic projects. In these settings, the promoter faces the challenge of agreeing strategic choices with multiple stakeholders with conflicting goals whilst avoiding scope creep, cost/time overruns, and defections. This study was sparked by a pluralistic setting where project outcomes were reportedly well aligned with strategic plans albeit scarce resources and longtime horizons. The setting is a capital program to develop a group of school buildings where national and local governments together with the schools faculties shared authority over strategic design choice. The study first extends Ostroms theory of polycentric commons governance to management studies on collective action. Using this cognitive lens, case research yields a model that illuminates how a robust polycentric commons structure can be advantageous to encourage multiple actors to collaborate and co-produce strategic design choice. We group organizing practices in two purposeful categories: preempting strategic disputes and resolving strategic disputes. We also trace local variance in the extent these practices succeed to get things done to target and yield innovative outcomes to how, first, this complex form of organizing delineates authority over strategic design choice; and two, the capabilities and limitations of this structure to preempt chaos from ensuing and to resolve local strategic disputes."
2016,"The Effects of Gendered Occupational Roles on Workplace Authority: Evidence from Microfinance Research in sociology and social psychology has documented how the gendering of occupational roles can affect a variety of outcomes for workers and organizations. Although laboratory experiments offer insights into the processes by which occupational roles become gendered and lead to systematically gendered outcomes, there is a relative dearth of evidence from field settings. Such field-based evidence is scarce because existing occupations are rarely gender balanced and workers tasks often change with new occupants. In the present paper, we fill this gap by utilizing unique data from a commercial microfinance bank in Central America. We examine how the occupational role of a loan manager becomes gendered, and how such initial gendering affects the authority of subsequent role occupants. Our findings both confirm and extend existing research. On average, male loan managers are more likely to obtain borrower compliance (i.e. on-time loan payments) than female managers. However, the gender of the initial manager continues to shape clients compliance even when clients are transferred to a second manager. Overall, this paper offers a unique empirical test of existing theories and demonstrates how a single individual can inscribe gendered expectations onto an occupational role, thereby generating divergent outcomes for male and female managers."
2016,"Better in the Shadows? Media Coverage and Market Reactions to Female CEO Appointments Combining media coverage data from a set of approximately 17,000 unique media outlets with the full population of CEO appointments for US publicly traded firms between 2000 and 2014, we investigate whether female CEO appointments garner more media attention compared to male appointments, and if so, whether this increased attention can help to make sense of the previously reported negative market reaction to these events. Contrary to prior reports, our data do not indicate that the appointments of female CEOs elicit negative market responses, on average. Our results do highlight an important moderating role of attention, however. We demonstrate that greater media coverage (even when exogenously determined) contributes to negative market reactions for female CEO appointments but positive market reactions for male CEOs, all else held constant. Additionally, female CEO appointments that attract little attention garner positive responses in the market, compared both to females that draw significant attention and to males drawing comparable, limited attention. Our results help to reconcile contrasting empirical findings on the effects of gender in executive leadership, and parallel recent research on second-order discrimination and anticipatory bias in alternative empirical contexts. We argue that gender is an important lens through which investors interpret heightened attention surrounding organizational events. Increased attention is interpreted positively when associated with males, but negatively when associated with females. Implications for research on media attention, gender bias, and executive succession are discussed."
2016,"The Second-Order Effects of Work: Female Labor Force Participation in Gujarat, 1981-2011 This study develops theory about the second-order effects of work, examining effects of womens labor force participation on the subsequent status of females within their communities. We analyze four panels (1981, 1991, 2001, 2011) of census data from 17,000 villages in the Indian state of Gujarat using fixed effects models. Distinguishing womens engagement in high and low status work, we find support for both economic and status equilibrium arguments: the influence of womens employment within a community on future conditions for females in that community varies with the relative status of jobs undertaken. Results show that female labor force participation in low status jobsmanual laboris associated with future increases in womens fundamental status (ratio of girls to boys under six years old), making more females available for low status work, and decreases in womens economic status (female literacy rate), reinforcing womens place as low status workers. Conversely, high status female labor force participationservice and white-collar workis unrelated to womens fundamental status, but precedes increases in womens economic status, allowing women options outside manual labor. Mens labor force participation moderates effects of female labor force participation, attenuating both positive effects of female labor force participation on womens fundamental status and negative effects of female labor force participation on womens economic status. That female labor force participation has mixed effects on womens status in subsequent periods raises the imperative for scholars of work inequality and gender to examine not only barriers to but also consequences of womens work.

2016,"Seeing Social Structure: Assessing the Accuracy of Interpersonal Judgments about Social Networks Sociological research has long recognized that, even in brief or routine interactions, people constantly make judgments about others social worlds and that these inferences can have material consequences in contexts as diverse as hiring, venture capital funding, and courtship encounters. Yet it remains unclear whether people are accurate in making these interpersonal judgments and, if so, how far they can see into the social structure that surrounds unfamiliar others. In this paper, we draw on the thin slice paradigm from social psychology to examine the question: How accurate are the inferences that people draw about the social networks of unfamiliar others whom they observe only fleetingly? Our data set includes over 2,100 interpersonal judgments made by 375 people about the social networks of 23 target individuals. Remarkably, we find that people are accurate in their judgments of unknown others proximate social structurethat is, the size and composition of targets reported contacts. They do not, however, make accurate judgments of the distal social structure surrounding unfamiliar other that is, the nature of connections among targets reported contacts. We also find that, when people make errors in such judgments, they tend to do so in ways that are consistent with gender stereotypes. We conclude with a discussion of this works implications for research on the interpenetration of cognition and social structure and on the antecedents of gender inequality."
2016,"Its Lonely at the Top for Men: A Gendered Perspective on Trust in Managerial Social Networks We argue that gender roles influence the interpretation of professional social network ties. We analyzed perceptions of competence and affect in the professional social networks of female and male managers occupying middle to senior managerial positions, and observed how these factors related to upward career mobility for men and women. We show that women occupying high positions in organizational hierarchies have more relationships underlined with affect and evaluate their network members as more competent. For men, the opposite is true: the higher up in the organizational hierarchy they are, they report less competent network members and they have less affect in their networks. We find that gender differences are the strongest when observing the ties to managers hierarchical peers, indicating that there are significant and contrasting differences between highly ranked men and women in the perceived competence and affect of their peers. Our study was set in Croatian post-socialist transition economy, and we show that gender differences are due to network perceptions of managers employed in formerly socialist companies, founded when gender norms were more strongly enforced, rather than with managers from companies founded after the society transitioned from socialism. We use this finding to sharpen our theoretical arguments."
2016,"Bridges across Chasms: How Mobility Across Geographic and Status Holes Affects Creative Performance When key employees leave to work for competitors, they embed their former employer within a mobility network which offers access to outside communication channels at the cost of leaking ideas to competition. Some former employees also span geographic and status holes when moving to competitors in different countries or status groups. This affects benefits and costs of the firms access to external knowledge. Testing these arguments in the context of the global fashion industry we find that key employees mobility to competitors has a higher impact on their former employers creative performance when they move across national boundaries than when they stay within such boundaries. Firms benefit from losing key employees to lower status competitors and suffer when they move to higher or same-status competitors."
2016,"How Embedded Ties Split Sides: Network and Tie Formation in Contingent Work Research into contingent work has emphasized how social network structures comprise the organizational locus of such labor markets and govern the exchange of resources between participants. This article embarks upon a necessary next step to discover the processes behind the formation of these networks and the dynamics of their constituent ties. Drawing from a roughly five-year ethnographic study of stand-up comedians in Los Angeles, I illustrate how the underlying attributes of work process, recurring interactions, work-related knowledge, and mutual dependence shape the degree of these ties embeddedness and network concentration. In this context, the strong relationships among newcomers are cultivated through thick processes and crystallize into tight, durable cliques. Such embedded ties enable collaborative production and knowledge sharing through mentorships, and how these partnerships render these groups stronger and more robust. This allows the stand-up comedy labor market and community to develop through a bottom-up process. The preponderance of embedded ties contributes to aspirants adopting a perspective of shared ownership over work, but these cliques tightness may exacerbate stagnancy in individuals careers and creativity and arbitrary exclusion of certain classes of workers. I suggest that studying tie formation and strength may elucidate many key dynamics within contingent work."
2016,"Where to, Now? How Reputation for Quality and Aspirational Performance Drive Product Search Firms introducing new products must make two important decisions: whether to keep the product within the domain of things familiar to the firm or venture into unfamiliar territory, and whether to move the product towards or away from rivals. Though these questions have been considered separately, they are rarely considered jointly. While many factors influence these decisions, recent research suggests firm reputation and performance will play a central role. Using the resource-based theory and the behavioral theory of the firm, we propose the firms reputation for quality (RFQ) and aspiration-relative performance will influence these decisions, and the relationships will be moderated by the prominence of the firm. Examining over 2,500 video games released on six console platforms between 2006 and 2010, we find evidence that RFQ leads firms to build upon the familiar and avoid rivals, and that firms choosing to release unfamiliar products view the opportunity to learn from rivals as worth the risk of unfavorable comparisons to them. For aspiration- relative performance, firms introduce familiar and non-rivalrous products rather than either rivalrous or non-rivalrous unfamiliar products; however, performance leads firms to prefer rivalrous/familiar product introductions to non-rivalrous/familiar introductions. Finally, we find that prominence generally moderates our proposed relationships."
2016,"External Threat, Core-Periphery Structure, and Radical Innovation in French Fashion, 1945-1973 Broadly speaking, the structural approach to creativity and innovation looks at how network positions influence the ability of social actors to generate novel and useful ideas and to implement them. Recent developments highlight semi-peripheral actors as being better innovators because they connect the legitimacy of the core to the freshness of the periphery. However, other approaches alternatively see the origin of innovativeness in the core or in the periphery. This calls for a theory contextualizing these effects. We suggest that the presence of an external threat can lead the core to promote practices and representations undermining its own position, and opening the way to an upward move of the periphery. This contrasts with other cases where the absence of external threat is characterized by more traditional core/periphery clashes for domination. We address this by conducting an inductive historical analysis of the complex diffusion process of ready-to-wear in French fashion between 1945 and 1973, focusing on the dynamics of networks, institutions, and cognitive frames. Ready-to-wear, an American radical innovation in fashion, displaced haute couture as the most significant activity in the industry but was recast as being essentially French (prt--porter). It diffused through the core of the existing network in four stages, transformed French fashion, and yet left swaths of the industry untouched."
2016,"Giving La Traviata a Contemporary Twist?How Market Identity Shapes Hybridity in Italian Opera In this paper we examine how the extent to which organizations market identities embody dominant audiences expectations and coalesce into well-defined exemplars affects their ability to recombine the expectations of audiences driven by divergent goals through category spanning. Using the case of major Italian Opera Houses and the tension between divergent audiences expectations that challenges their programming strategies, we hypothesize that a steadfast adherence to the codes of a category that incarnates prevailing audiences prescriptions in the past creates incentives for organizations to contaminate it with oppositional normative expectations. In addition, we hypothesize that organizations efforts to eclipse the emblematic and recognizable exemplars of a category imbued with dominant prescriptions positively influence their willingness to pursue hybrid strategies as well, in particular when organizations position themselves within high status brackets. This study contributes to literature on market identity and category spanning by offering a novel theorization of the identity-based determinants of category spanning under conditions of audience heterogeneity."
2016,"Think Global, Drink Local: Field Configuring Interactions and the Detroit Water Crisis Using a qualitative case study of the Detroit water shutoffs from 2013 through 2015, I explore how a macro-level institutional and field change, the passage of the Human Right to Water and Sanitation at the United Nations in 2010, impacted micro-level actions and change. Several stages of change in the understandings, positions, and rules of the field at the local level are identified that are driven by informal opportunities for macro and micro actors to connect, termed field configuring interactions. Second, four novel mechanisms of change are identified to explain the process by which these micro-macro interactions impact field transitions: collective catharsis, moral catalysis, moral amplification, and potentiation. The findings of this research contribute to the emerging understanding of the multi-level interactions between actors across levels of the field by offering an in situ study of how individual actors and agents interact with macro actors to catalyze and amplify change. Issues of water scarcity, access, and inequalities are also explored."
2016,"A Behavioral Economics Perspective on Crisis Management Decision-Making Scholarly work in the crisis management field has flourished in recent years with contributions from numerous disciplines, including strategic management, organizational behavior, public relations, risk management, and disaster management. However, the substantial and prospective applications from the growing field of behavioral economicsfrom Herbert Simon to modern theoristshave not yet been systematically integrated into the literature. This paper presents a framework that categorizes applications from behavioral economics along two broad stages of the crisis management processcrisis preparation and crisis action. It provides keen insights for practitioners into the crisis decision-making process."
2016,"Organizational Resilience: On the linkage between volatility absorption and performance recovery Organizational resilience describes the absorption of volatility created by discrete or continuous internal or external strains coupled with performance recovery. Against the backdrop of more frequently occurring economic downturns triggered by societal, political and economic unrests and shocks, organizational resilience has become a major strategic agenda item. A critical reflection on organizational resilience research, however, shows that extant literature suffers from specific shortcomings. This essentially starts with the relationship between volatility absorption and subsequent performance recovery which is inherently assumed in the construct of organizational resilience. Therefore, we develop a sound theoretical underpinning for the assumed positive relationship between volatility absorption and performance recovery and the moderating influences of four organizational contingencies based on an organizational routine and dynamic capability perspective. Drawing on a sample of S&P; 500 firms over a time period of about 20 years (1994-2014), we find support for the positive relationship between volatility absorption and performance recovery. Additionally, our work makes an empirical contribution by showing that the strength of the main relationship is contingent on a number of organizational characteristics."
2016,"Don't Ask Me If It's A Just War, It's Just War: A Contextual Perspective on Psychological Injury Recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have re-ignited debates on how to prevent and manage psychological injury among returning troops. We use a unique ethnography of a military medical teams tour of duty in Camp Bastion, Afghanistan, to explore the role of the institutional context as a contributing factor to psychological injury from war. We find that exposure to war and its consequences can invoke sustained experiences of senselessness, futility, and surreality that form a stark contrast with cultural expectations, professional role identity, and organizational protocol, and can thus threaten peoples existential grounding in this institutional context. We show how people are forced to rely on a range of personal coping strategies to deal with this dislocating experience. We argue that these coping strategies fail to fully resolve the existential trauma that lies at the heart of psychological distress at war, and may even contribute to it, thus increasing the likelihood of psychological injury. We discuss implications for practice as well as directions for future research."
2016,"Dealing with the unexpected: Using latent structures for efficiency and resilience  In order to be effective, many organizations need to combine an ability to operate efficiently with an ability to deal with unforeseen disruptions (resilience). We explore how organizations can manage this efficiency-resilience challenge by complementing their primary structures (designed for efficiency) with flexible, latent structures that lie beneath the surface and become activated when they face a disruption. Specifically, we explore what type of latent structures organizations need to master in order to be capable of dealing with various types of disruptions. In addition, we conceptually explore two switching mechanisms that can allow organizations to quickly recognize the need for activating a latent structure and, subsequently, orchestrate such an effort. All in all, this manuscript advances new knowledge on the antecedents and mechanisms that may enable organizational efficiency and resilience."
2016,"The Company You Keep: Effects of Leader and Teams Network Position on Performance In this paper we argue that leaders positively influence team performance through their positions in a collaboration network. We propose also that the leaders effect on team performance is moderated by the position of the team in the larger collaboration network. We distinguish between brokerage and cohesion as the extreme positions that a leader or team can occupy in a collaboration network. To test our hypotheses, we study a network of French movie teams (comprising directors, producers, art directors, editors, and cinematographers) between 1996 and 2010. We find that the network position of the team leader  the movie director  has a U-shaped effect on team performance. Leaders with either a brokerage or a cohesive network position contribute most to team performance. We show further that the benefits the leader can reap from his or her network position depend significantly on the teams position in a collaboration network. Specifically, for high levels of team cohesion, the U-shaped effect of the team leader cohesion on performance flattens. We explore the implications of these results for scholars and practitioners."
2016,"When boundary-spanners shift gears: Role transition and individual ambidexterity Boundary spanners are often required to pursue novelty (exploration) while also adhering to the status quo in the firm (exploitation). Boundary spanners who are ambidextrous, i.e. engaging in both exploration and exploitation, are an important source of novel and applicable knowledge. In taking an identity perspective, we suggest that boundary spanners hold a portfolio of role identities  mental representations that explicate behavior within functional roles  to address different demands. We posit that their predisposition to either separate or blur role domains (called role segmentation and role integration) influences their proficiency in engaging exploitation and exploration simultaneously. Our results from a two-wave survey indicate that role segmenters are less apt to behave ambidextrously. However, role segmenters are supported in integrating different roles when embedded in cross-functional coordination."
2016,"Excavating Structural Holes: Formal Decomposition, Disconfirmation, and Directions Forward Structural holes is a rich theoretical program with a burgeoning contingency literature required to explain its extensive inconclusive and contradictory results. We propose that the literatures contradictions derive from subtly problematic measures and imprecise mappings to the theorys propositions. Formally decomposing aggregate constraint, this paper reveals that the measure combines five potentially conflicting network properties, suggests that the widely referenced structural effect on performance is almost completely attributable to dyadic activity dependence, identifies those network properties that can test structural holes, and disconfirms structural holes. The clarity we add by decomposing constraint provides a path forward for reconciling previously recognized conflicting findings and the new insight that structural holes probably explains very little, if any, of the existing literature."
2016,"Friends and Foes:Towards A Cognition- and Resource-Based Model of Coopetition Value-driven cooperation between competitors is becoming increasingly salient, especially in knowledge intensive industries. However, theoretical developments on cooperation and competition remain largely disconnected, as a result, the dynamic interplay between competition and cooperation is largely left in a black box. This paper draws the relevant insights from two critical streams of research on inter-firm interactions, RBV and managerial cognition, to construct a process model with parallel mediating paths elucidating the dynamic interplay between competition in the downstream product market and cooperation in the upstream factor market."
2016,"Disconnectedness as Boon or Misfortune? Structural Isolation and Hedge Fund Returns Almost every field includes actors disconnected from the relevant social network. Yet, social network theory has paid too little attention to such isolates. While isolates might intuitively be expected to underperform connected actors, connectedness has been found to be disadvantageous at least in some cases, suggesting that isolates can sometimes outperform connected actors. In this study, I investigate the conditions under which isolates underperform or outperform connected actors, and find a trade-off between the disadvantages and advantages of isolation. On one hand, isolates are cut off from the information that can be learned through social ties. On the other hand, isolates can resist pressures to adopt widespread but fallacious narratives. Market uncertainty magnifies both effects, as the value of information and the danger of herding both increase. Regression analyses conducted on hedge funds find that isolates underperform or outperform connected actors depending on their reliance on market information and their susceptibility to groupthink. My findings highlight the linkage between isolation, uncertainty and performance, and provide insights on what it means to be connected or disconnected."
2016,"David and Goliath?: A Pragmatic Strategy Theory of Social Movement Target Selection In selecting targets, social movements face a tradeoff between ambition and feasibility. Past research on anti-corporate mobilization suggests that activists seek to bypass this problem by challenging highly prominent organizations. The prominence of these targets satisfies the ambition of activists, and may also enhance feasibility by attracting media attention and mobilizing movement adherents. However, prominent targets generally also possess the means to resist or redirect challengers, making it a high-risk, high-reward strategy. This paper follows this reasoning to develop a theory of activists as pragmatic strategists who will target weaker opponents, seeking to build a groundswell of change starting from the bottom of an organizational field rather than from the top. Analyses of the Sierra Clubs Beyond Coal campaign, which has helped to retire more than one-third of existing U.S. coal plants since 2008, demonstrate the usefulness of the pragmatic strategy model for understanding social movement target selection, organizational change, and the environment."
2016,"David Defeating Goliath: Institutional Work of A Marginalized Actor Within Institutional Complexity The purpose of our study is to answer the following research question: how can marginal actors with limited resources and power achieve institutional change by creating and promoting their logic? Drawing on a historical-longitudinal case study of one of the most intense environmental controversy between an Indigenous Nation, and Hydro-Qubec, in James Bay, northern Quebec, this paper makes three contributions to current discussions of institutional change and logics. First, we identify three strategic mechanisms - capacity-building, field expansion and changing own logic - through which marginalized actors are able to initiate and maintain the need for change despite continuous pressure from a strong, resourceful and legitimate competing logic. Second, responding to several calls for research on the unintended outcomes of the institutional work achieved, our research advances the conceptualization of institutional work accumulation. Third, our study shows that actors and the logics they convey are not static; rather, they are dynamic and evolve during the process while actors negotiate issues of competing logics and complexity."
2016,"Strategic frame alignment and hybridization in the emergence of a social enterprise. Previous research on hybrid organizations has typically viewed them as facing stable, well-understood institutional pressures. However, many hybrid organizations address social issues that are subject to interpretation via the frames carried by individuals. In this paper, we examine the frame alignment process by which a hybrid organization attempts to mobilize customers and business partners needed to sustain the organization. Based on longitudinal case study of a Sicilian tourism social enterprise aimed at fighting the practice of extortion payments to the Mafia, we advance a process model of strategic frame alignment and hybridization: depending on the consonance of existing frames with the frames of resource providers, these frames are retained, made dormant, or aligned. Paradoxically, we find that the most ideologically-central frames, because they are viewed as sacred and resistant to manipulation, are particularly prone to being suppressed entirely in the new venture. We discuss implications for literatures on strategic framing, ideology, and hybrid organizations."
2016,"Social Entrenchment: Social Network Cohesion and Board Responsiveness to Shareholder Proposals Shareholder activism has become an increasingly prominent means for investors to voice their concerns in corporate governance matters. Past work examines a number of firm and proponent characteristics that affect shareholder proposal targeting, voting, and implementation outcomes. However, we know little about how social network ties among firms and corporate leaders affect shareholder activism. Prior research suggests that social cohesion among corporate leaders helps preserve managerial control. Drawing on this tradition, I argue that social cohesion in the board overlap network helps managers and firms resist shareholder activism. I test these ideas with data on overlapping board appointments and shareholder proposals for S&P; 1500 firms. To examine how network cohesion varies across the network topology, I apply a hierarchical cohesive blocking routine that characterizes how firms are nested within more or less structurally cohesive substructures. Results from indicate that deeply nested firms (firms in more cohesive substructures) are more likely to be targeted by activists but these proposals draw less voting support and are less likely to be implemented by the board. I argue that structural cohesion helps support norms of reciprocity and mutual regard among corporate elites that is useful for maintaining managerial control and resisting shareholder activism."
2016,"Nice to meet you - the role of relational embeddedness on successful private shareholder activism Institutional investors play a crucial role in the corporate governance landscape as they hold significant stakes and frequently engage in shareholder activism. Most of the activism institutional investors pursue, happens behind the scenes within private negotiations with targeted firms. However, research on the process and success factors of such private engagements is scarce. Arguing from an embeddedness point of view, we claim that the number, type, and strength of relationships institutional investors establish and maintain with targeted companies increase the likelihood of engagement success. Using a detailed and unique dataset on private shareholder activism, we find support for our arguments and thereby contribute to a better understanding of engagements pursued by institutional investors."
2016,"When Do Interorganizational Relations Serve Client Benefit? The Role of Enabling Network Structures The vibrant scholarly inquiry into the outcomes of interorganizational relations has rarely attended to the outcomes of these relations for organizations clients. We therefore lack good understanding of how interorganizational networks serve the benefits of the clients, particularly when organizational outcomes are loosely coupled with the clients outcomes. We posit that the clients benefit from providers networks depends on the providers knowledge of their partners complementary capabilities. We examine two relational factors that lower barriers to knowledge sharing and thereby help clients benefit from providers network relations. Building on insights from social comparison theory, we argue that organizations are more likely to know their partners complementary capabilities and employ these complementarities to the benefit of the clients when their performance visibly differs from that of their network partners. We further argue that preferential transaction with a limited set of partners has a beneficial effect on client outcomes. An analysis of a regional network of patient transfers among 110 hospitals supported these arguments."
2016,"The Structural Holes of the Closest Partner and the Evolution of Focal Unit's Centrality Adding to existing studies on social network research, which focuses on the effects of a focal unit's structural attributes on the evolution of its network, this study theoretically emphasizes and empirically examines the effects of the closest partners structural attributes in intra- and inter-organizational networks on the evolution of the focal units centrality in an intra-organizational network. By testing the effects of the closest partners structural holes in intra- and inter- organizational networks on the evolution of the focal units centrality, we find that the closest partners structural holes in intra- organizational networks negatively affect the evolution of the centrality of the focal unit while the closest partners structural holes in an inter-organizational network positively affect the evolution of the centrality of the focal unit."
2016,"Disentangling the dynamics of institutional compliance mechanisms The mechanisms by which institutional pressures are translated into substantive or symbolic compliance represent a burning issue, notably in global production networks. The objective of this study is to propose a theoretical framework that can help understanding the underlying factors affecting this issue. In this study, we have generated a series of propositions that disentangle the complex links between institutional pressures, field and network characteristics, and institutional compliance. In particular, we provided a network-based explanation to why typical institutional pressures (e.g. social activism, consumer boycotts, government regulation or voluntary standards and codes of conduct) may be ineffective to drive substantive compliance in issue fields."
2016,"Tie Dissolution in Market Networks: A Theory of Vicarious Performance Feedback In an ongoing exchange relationship, managers need to periodically evaluate their exchange partner to decide whether to continue or dissolve the exchange tie. However, assessing a partners contribution to firm performance is often non-trivial. We argue in this paper that managers observe the performance trajectories of their partners other partners, and use this information to evaluate their exchange partners. We put forward a theory of vicarious performance feedback, and test it in the context of Formula 1 motor racing. We find that constructors are more likely to end an exchange relationship with an engine supplier after that suppliers other customers experience an episode of poor performance relative to their track record. We contribute to literatures on inferential learning, performance feedback theory, and network evolution."
2016,"Effects of Inter-organizational and Institutional Trust on Knowledge Acquisition Across Borders We empirically examine how dimensions of inter-organizational trust (ability-based, benevolence-based and integrity-based) and dimensions of institutional-based trust (legal enforceability and ethical norms) affect the acquisition of knowledge in cross-border business relationships of internationalizing firms. Analyses of 220 international relationships in the renewable energy industry show that institutional-based trust interacts with inter-organizational trust when impacting knowledge acquisition in various ways. Our findings underscore the distinct nature of inter-organizational trust dimensions and emphasize the role of institutional-based trust in inter-organizational relationships. They further help to explain under what conditions what kind of inter-organizational trust really matters for knowledge acquisition in cross-border partnerships."
2016,"Network of Cultural Production: Network Effects in Korean TV Drama Production, 2002-2011 This paper examines effects of collaboration networks on cultural products performance. While conventional approaches focused on the role of talented individuals, recent conceptions of cultural production share a common interest in the role of collaboration among specialists from diverse backgrounds. This paper deals with following three questions: 1) which is the better governance of cultural production between network governance and hierarchical governance? 2) which is the better structure of collaboration network in cultural production between open and closed networks? 3) how does the position of key participants in collaboration networks affect cultural production? The findings of our study on all TV dramas produced in South Korea 2002-2011 suggest that the performance of TV drama is affected positively by network governance, closed network, and status of key actors."
2016,"The Fickle Crowd: Selective Differentiation in Cultural Markets Much of previous research has made important progress in our understanding of evaluations in cultural markets. However, its predictions on the effect of past popularity on future evaluations have often been contradictory. While studies of cumulative advantage suggest that future audiences will infer quality from a previous audiences appreciation, others suggest that heterogeneous tastes for popularity will lead highly popular products to lose their appeal among those who do not want to be seen as just following the crowd. We address the tension between these two lines of research by distinguishing two different quality signals the popular visibility of the product and the previous audiences critical evaluation. We argue that products are evaluated highly to the extent that they have already been evaluated widely and received positive evaluations in the past, since these two cues independently signal high quality. However, products that are both popular and highly evaluated are subject to a quality discount, since their broad appeal provides ripe opportunities for subsequent evaluators to differentiate their identities by breaking from the pack and demonstrating their distinctiveness as critics. By differentiating these two cues of appreciation from the past, we identify conditions under which popular appreciation drives cumulative advantage and conditions under which it instead leads to devaluation. We test this theory using a massive longitudinal data set of approximately 2.2 million online beer reviews spanning fifteen years."
2016,"Connect the Dots, but Deliberately: Intrapersonal Diversity in Function and Genre in Creative Team Extant research on intrapersonal diversity, i.e., knowledge/experience diversity embedded in individuals, has recognized it as a one-dimensional concept. We argue that such a view is too simplistic, masking the heterogeneity of intrapersonal diversity, which has different implications for team performance. In this study, we specifically distinguish between intrapersonal diversity in function (or functional diversity) and intrapersonal diversity in genre (or genre diversity), and we theorize that they have different impacts on creative team performance. We test our hypotheses using comprehensive data of 9,855 music singles from the Japanese music industry published over 27 years. Our results found that the functional diversity of both music composers and lyricists increases the probability of creating hit songs, including blockbusters, whereas their genre diversity decreases it. In addition, an overlap of functional diversity between composer and lyricist increases the chances of creating moderate-level hit-songs as they accumulate collaborative experiences with each other. As a first attempt to disentangle the nuanced complexity of intrapersonal diversity, this study contributes to theories and empirics on intrapersonal diversity and teams creative performances."
2016,"Labor mobility and high performance High performance typically results from complicated processes combining various resources with a lot of luck. This paper focuses on one such resource, namely experience, and on how the diverse experience acquired through engaging in labor mobility affects professionals probability of high performance. I propose that the relationship between labor mobility and high performance is contingent upon the market in which professionals compete. Based on a matched sample of 1860 filmmakers of which half engage in mobility, I analyze how different task characteristics predominate in two sub markets of the film industry, and how this variation affects the relationship between professionals foreign experience obtained through labor mobility, and their probability of contributing to high performance. The findings indicate that mobile professionals benefit from the mobility event if they contribute to projects characterized by complex and non-routine tasks but that this effect is reversed if they contribute to projects characterized by low complexity and routine tasks. The effect of mobility increases with increasing distance between the local and the foreign context, and decreases with increasing industry internationalization."
2016,"Becoming Francis Ford Coppola: The Importance of Reputational Rank in Artistic Career Success The objective of this study is to develop a role-theoretic perspective on reputational rank that helps theorize and test how reputation formation and career development intertwine in project-based labor markets. We argue that affiliational status is an important mechanism for aspirants to enter the periphery of a project-based labor markets, whereas reputational rank within each status group is important for novices to move to the core of the labor market. Status and reputation represent, in other words, not only important career barriers, they facilitate also career mobility, initially through affiliational status, later through reputational rank. We test our arguments on a comprehensive sample of complete career trajectories of aspirant feature film directors graduating from The National Film School of Denmark between 1968 and 2013. Specifically, aspirant directors using high status actors in their graduation film are more likely to become novice directors by directing their first film, and higher commercial and artistic reputational ranks increase the likelihood that novice directors become veteran directors by continuing to direct films."
2016,"Best in Class: The Returns on Endorsement in Business School Admissions Scholars have long suggested that elite groups are advantaged during the hiring of individuals into organizations. Less studied, however, is why key organizational decision makers may favor elites and their recommended candidates during applicant assessment and selection, especially in merit-driven organizations and educational institutions aiming to select the most qualified individuals. We begin to address this gap in the literature by investigating why endorsements a common practice by which elite individuals grant support to certain applicants may influence admission and post-admission outcomes. Using the entire population of 21,324 applicants to a full-time MBA program between 2002 and 2008, we find that even after controlling for key individual qualifications and merits, applicants endorsed by faculty, business leaders, and alumni, among others, are significantly advantaged over non-endorsed applicants during interview and admission decisions. In seeking to explain this advantage, we test three dominant explanations for why endorsed applicants may be favored over non-endorsed applicants during evaluation and selection: They may be 1) better qualified when applying; 2) better matched to the position / organization; and/or 3) better citizens. In our study, we find support only for our better citizen explanation, in that individuals endorsed as applicants make larger monetary donations to the school after graduation than non-endorsed individuals. We conclude by discussing the implications of this study for understanding the impact of elite groups and their employment endorsements on labor markets."
2016,"Drawing-In and Splitting-Apart Diverse Recruits Via the Legitimized, Ambiguous Frame of Impact How does an organization attempt to recruit and manage diversity, and how might such an attempt fail? There has been a lack of research on the processes through which organizations attempt to recruit and manage diversity. To consider how these processes might explain the failure of such attempts, I draw on an inductive case study of a consulting firm. The organization utilized a legitimized but ambiguous frameof having Impactto recruit and organize diverse members. I find that the legitimized and ambiguous frame of Impact enabled three sets of processes. First, the frame enabled mobilization processes, invoking broad and deep resonance with candidates to mobilize a diverse but expectant group of recruits to join the organization. Second, the frame enabled socialization processes, wherein after entry, recruits were socialized to heighten the frames legitimacy and ambiguity. Third, the frame enabled sensemaking processes, wherein as recruits gained project experience, they came to use these experiences to make sense of the ambiguous frame of Impact by parsing new, divergent frames from the original frame, and through these divergent frames recruits evaluated the worth of their work. The consequences of these three sets of processes were disillusioned exits, turnover, and disconnects between groups. I theorize how these processes, then, explain a paradoxical dynamic of drawing-in but then splitting- apart of diverse recruits. I suggest how this process model has theoretical implications for diversity, framing, and sensemaking scholarship."
2016,"From attraction to identification: Analyzing institutionalized values in job advertisement visuals Notions of what constitutes the relationship between employer and employees have been changing over time. In this article, I argue that analyzing visuals allows capturing complexity and tensions in the changing notions of employment, as visuals are able to conceal conflicting beliefs. With visuals in job advertisements companies communicate their identity as an em-ployer. From an institutional perspective, organizations construct their organizational identity by drawing on institutionalized elements such as society level values. In my study I am inter-ested in how organizations visually construct and communicate their organizational identity in job ads and how changing values that define the relationship between employer and employ-ees are reflected in and constructed by these visuals. Combining quantitative and qualitative methods, I identify visual types that have been used in job advertisements in the German fash-ion industry over a time period of 45 years. The results illustrate a shift from generically at-tracting applicants to individually addressing and inviting them to identity with the organiza-tion. My study thereby contributes to an understanding of recruitment as institutionally em-bedded and to the use of visuals to explore meaning construction."
2016,"Fear or Familiarity? Neighborhood Effects and Employers' Perceptions of a Criminal Record This article examines how neighborhood violent crime influences hiring decisions made by local employers. I focus on the labor market outcomes of job seekers with a criminal record, arguing that prior audit studies have overlooked important neighborhood-level factors that could potentially affect employers evaluations of a criminal record. I develop a theoretical account that helps to reconcile two conflicting expectations as to how employers will respond to recent violent crime. One perspective suggests that employers in neighborhoods with violent crime will look past criminal records because of legal cynicism and desensitization to crime. An alternative perspective indicates that recent exposure to violent crime will instead amplify employers negative responses to the mark of a criminal record because of employers heightened fear and risk concerns. Data from an audit study with 368 job applications submitted across 146 neighborhoods in one city provides support for the latter expectation. Findings from this study have important implications for research on labor market inequality, neighborhood effects, and race."
2016,"When not having friends may hurt you? High-skilled immigrants' & job search outcomes Using the National Science Foundation's survey of science and engineering doctorates, a significant minority of whom were immigrants, this study sheds light on two questions. First, how does the effectiveness of friendship contacts compare to other types of contacts in finding good jobs? Second, when does poor access to friendship contacts matter more in job search? My results suggest that the lack of friendship contacts did not disadvantage immigrant scientist and engineers in finding research intensive jobs in academia and industry. However, friendship contacts mattered in obtaining managerial jobs in industry. I explored and found support for two possible mechanisms underlying the observed differences in associations between friendship contacts and early career job outcomes of high-skilled immigrants relative to native-born: immigrant scientist and engineers reliance on faculty contacts for finding research intensive jobs, and employers high (vs. low) concern with candidates cultural and occupational fit when filling managerial (vs. research) positions, which required working closely with co- workers and customers. Implications for research on social networks and early career jobs in high-skilled labor markets are discussed."
2016,"Is the Crowd Colorblind? Founder race and performance in crowdfunding The dearth of minority entrepreneurs has received increasing media attention but few academic analyses. In particular, the funding process creates challenges for either audit or correspondence methods, making it difficult to assess the role, or type, of discrimination influencing resource providers. We use a novel approach that combines analyses of 10,194 crowdfunding projects with an experimental design to identify whether African-American men are discriminated against and whether this reflects statistical, taste-based, or unconscious bias on the part of prospective supporters. We find that African- American men are significantly less likely to receive funding that similar white founders, and that prospective supporters rate identical projects as lower in quality when the believe the founder is an African-American male. We conclude that the reduction in perceived quality does not reflect conscious assumptions of differences in founder ability or disamenity but rather an unconscious assumption that black founders are lower quality. In a final experiment we show that the racial penalty can be removed by providing prospective supporters with additional evidence of quality via third-party endorsements (i.e. awards, evidence of prior support)."
2016,Market Structure and the Advancement of Innovations How do social heterogeneity and social inequality in markets affect the processes of social learning and consensus formation about the value of an innovation over time? This article develops and tests a dynamic model of innovation adoption in the presence of social heterogeneity and social inequality. Heterogeneity and inequality affect social learning over time -- the process by which individuals communicate with others and update their beliefs about the value of the innovation  to affect innovation uptake. The article provides a preliminary test of this model by simulating innovation uptake among 43 independent markets and comparing the distribution of simulated uptake to empirical uptake patterns in these markets over time. Insights from these analyses indicate that social heterogeneity exerted a positive effect on innovation adoption over time while social inequality exerted a negative effect on innovation adoption over time. Analytic solutions and empirical tests of this model reveal that market structure influences social learning about the value of an innovation over time and shapes patterns of innovation adoption among individuals.
2016,"Doing Well and Doing Good? The Hidden Burdens of Meaningful Work Does serving the poor create organizational instability? Increasingly, for-profit firms incorporate social goalssuch as poverty alleviationinto their missions. Research suggests that employees who perform socially significant tasks experience this work as meaningful and rewarding. As a result, those who perform meaningful work should be less likely to turn over. I explore this proposition in a commercial microfinance bank where loan officers lend to poor and middle-income clients. Officers have the same basic compensation and responsibilities when lending to poor and middle-income clients, but they report that lending to the poor is more meaningful. Contrary to theoretical expectations, I find that officers likelihood of exiting the organization increases as they perform more meaningful work. I then use qualitative data to explore this tendency. I show that officers encounter unique physical challengeslike exhaustion and insecuritywhen working with the poor. These unseen burdens make officers work with poor clientele more difficult. This paper demonstrates how serving vulnerable populations can both create meaningful work for employees and foster organizational instability. More broadly, it advances the theoretical concept of noble-but-dirty work as an essential feature of organizations that blend social goals with profitability aims."
2016,"Skills Not Schools? The Role of Educational Backgrounds in Accessing Jobs in High Tech Educational institutions play a central role in shaping labor market prospects in modern societies. As access to postsecondary education has expanded in recent decades, distinctions in the types of postsecondary institutions workers attend have become increasingly important (Gerber and Cheung 2008). While workers with elite educational backgrounds are generally expected to have better labor market prospects, distinguishing the role of various theoretical mechanisms in explaining their advantage remains a high research priority. I examine the hiring of software engineers at 277 high tech firms concentrated in Silicon Valley. I argue that the easy observability of skills and intensity of market competition makes this a conservative setting in which to analyze the role of educational prestige in accessing employment. I find that workers with prestigious educational backgrounds are strongly favored in screening. Further, workers with prestigious backgrounds are advantaged because they demonstrate superior skills and because of the signaling value of their credentials. Comparing across firms, I find mixed evidence with respect to higher quality firms having a stronger preference for workers with prestigious backgrounds. I also find no evidence that having similar backgrounds as the firms leaders or network connections to the firm contribute to the prestigious degree advantage."
2016,"Entrepreneurship Of Misery: Entrepreneurial Activity In Extreme Poverty In this inductive, exploratory paper we study how emotions impact vulnerable persons agency, and how restoring emotional balance acts as an effective antecedent of successful institutional work and/or entrepreneurship. We focus primarily on how noxious emotions stemming from misery and/or exclusion can diminish in a very significant way entrepreneurial agency, making success much more difficult and preventing the kind of institutional work needed to contest institutions. Through the in-depth case of a social entrepreneur coming from a shantytown who managed to break through institutional constraints and create a successful business enterprise with a social mission, we show how emotions can contribute to the construction of a self that projects the reproduction of the social order rather than change, and how effective intervention can break the cycle of poverty and hopelessness that is dominant among excluded people. We find that this emergent process is both stochastic and fragile, contingent to the random presence of a web of actors who supported the entrepreneur, contributing not only standard capital (social, cultural, economic) but also and perhaps most importantly, with emotional engagement that allowed restoring the emotional balance of the person, thus enabling entrepreneurial agency."
2016,"Illegitimacy through scandal: Discursive representations in response to transgressions Organizational actions instigate scandals when external stakeholders think that they transgress important norms. Studying the escalation of such scandals increases our understanding of when, how, and why transgressions are likely to influence organizational legitimacy detrimentally. We focus on a scandal related to Nokias shutdown of a production and R&D; site in Germany, a transgression that eventually embedded Nokia in German public discourse as an infamous exemplar of irresponsible corporate behavior. We develop a model linking the discursive representations and motivations of stakeholders for responding to transgressions as key catalysts in scandal escalation. Our study contributes to the literature on organizational legitimacy and scandal by elaborating the temporal dynamics of legitimacy struggles. In particular, we highlight the role of decontextualized and recontextualized discursive representations in making a particular transgression an exemplar of more generic contested issues and thereby contributing to the escalation and longevity of the scandal."
2016,"How Decision Makers Resolve Ethical Dilemmas in Professional Fields: A Person X Situation Model Recent events in the financial, accounting and healthcare industries have heightened the need to understand how individuals in the professions make ethical decisions. This paper advances a cognitive theory of how individual decision makers in the professions reconcile competing logics in their mental models as they deal with ethical dilemmas in their everyday practice. Professional fields represent sites of institutional complexity where individuals face multiple and competing institutional logics. Drawing on recent advances in institutional theory and the literature on ethical decision making, we theorize that, faced with complex and ambiguous cases, decision makers construct simplified representations of the problems at hand, in which the competing logics prevailing in the wider institutional environment will determine the likelihood of an (un)ethical outcome. Adopting a dual-process perspective, we propose that the particular logics that come to prevail in decision makers mental models are moderated as a function of stable individual differences in respect of cognitive style and core self-evaluation. In addition, we propose that experience moderates the utilization of logics and likelihood of an (un)ethical outcome. We suggest methodological approaches to test our model and discuss directions for future research more generally."
2016,"Media Darlings and Media Demons: The Effect of Media Reputation on Firms Post-Scandal Recovery In this paper, we investigate the role of pre-scandal media reputation on firms post-scandal reputational recovery. Building on the concept of media reputation as a strategic resource, we evaluate the emotional content of the media coverage of firms before they are found to have engaged in misconduct. We find that both media darlings  those that the media describes with high levels of positive emotion  and media demons  those the media describes with high levels of negative emotion  recover their prior media reputations more quickly than firms with moderate levels of either positive or negative emotional language in media reporting. Our findings suggest that positive media reputation buffers firms from negative evaluations, consistent with prior research. In addition, we find that negative media reputation also acts as a buffer to further reputational damage, which we speculate is because misconduct is consistent with expectations of such firms. We test our theory on a sample of 84 U.S. firms restating earnings between 1997 and 2006."
2016,"Silence as Mechanism of Institutional Maintenance We present a case study on harmful industrial waste disposal practices that had been lasting more than twenty years in Italy, carrying non-exclusive negative consequences for the health and the environment. Discursive perspectives on institutional maintenance view it as a process of repair or reinforcement based on the production of supportive texts by incumbents. The findings of this study show that institutional maintenance can also be associated with a process of silence based on the marginalization of texts that problematize institutional arrangements."
2016,"Growth and Vulnerability in Africa as a Consequence of Chinese Investment Despite its late entry into the market, China has become the largest trading partner with sub-Saharan African countries. In fact, China pumped over $210 million into Africa last year. The consequence of this recent trend, for both African countries and MNCs looking to invest there, has been widely debated and speculated. This paper empirically investigates the economic, development, and environmental consequences of Chinese investment in a sample of sub-Saharan African countries. Using strategic management theories around capabilities transfer and world systems theory, we argue that Chinese investment should increase economic growth, but this economic growth will not be equally distributed among the population and could lead to negative environmental and social development consequences. Our findings demonstrate that some of the concerns around Chinese investment are well founded, but the relationships are complex. We discuss implications for Base of the Pyramid and strategy research, seeking to understand the conditions under which different foreign investments are likely to be profitable."
2016,"Knowing Pains: Identity Based Market Control and the Creation of the Hollywood Studio Business Model Organization theory scholars have recently devoted considerable attention to the development of new business models. To date much of the work has focused on the micro-social dynamics that promote recognition of common business models; by contrast, our study will focus on how specific practices adopted by firms come to be recognized as components of a larger business model and how the community of practice at the heart of the promotion of these business models is strengthened as more firms adopt those practices. From this discussion, we develop several testable hypotheses about growth and the new business model, recognition of the new business model and a reduction in competitive pressure, active coordination to avoid competition among firms that have adopted the new business model, and widespread recognition of the new business model in society as the ordered market grows. We test these hypotheses by studying the identities and dynamics of the population of for profit firms that produced and released feature films in the US until 1930. The emergence of the Hollywood studios during this period offers a very appropriate setting to test a framework focused on the development of entirely new business models. We find support for our hypotheses and close with the discussion of the theoretical contributions of our research."
2016,"Express it all out! Can we? Field-level identity expression within a societal-level culture Through a 212-day ethnography of nine mother and two satellite Pentecostal churches located in Surabaya, Surakarta, and Bandung, we explore the relationship between institutional logics, field-level identity claims, field-level identity expression, and societal-level culture. We identify two governing field-level logics, the divinity and business logics, which are strategically translated by organizational members into two field-level identity claims of the true evangelizer of Christian religion and the divine channel of abundant blessings. Because field-level identity claims will only become meaningful if they are expressed, these churches are engaged in several organizational practices of mass and personal evangelization. However, our data shows that the field-level identity expression is affected by the level of Islamic radicalism and devoutness that are prevalent in a particular city, in which the intricacies of field-level identity expression of the two claims increases as the organizations move westwards geographically, that is from Surabaya to Bandung."
2016,"Getting away with persistent institutional heterodoxy through identity work  The paper explores the case of persistent institutional heterodoxy and the mechanisms that allow it to be sustained over a long time and against all odds, a condition that institutional theory tends not to account for. It uncovers that the processes of identity work allow individuals to be neither conformists nor institutional innovators. The study analyses the case of geriatricians, medical doctors belonging to the unconventional medical speciality of geriatrics, and the mundane identity work that they conduct every day in the interaction with patients and among themselves."
2016,"When Categories Interact: Insights from Analyzing U.S. listed Chinese Companies Analyst Coverage In this paper, I sample 145 Chinese companies that went public in U.S. capital markets and test hypotheses about analysts coverage following their IPOs. Drawing on population ecology, I hypothesize and establish that analysts apply the category of Chinese companies as more Chinese companies choose to be listed on major U.S. stock exchanges. Furthermore, I explored the interactions between home county categories and industry categories. Specifically, I found that part of the category emergence of Chinese companies happened within the industry categories as opposed to across industry categories, yet the relative contribution of the category emergence within the industry categories to category emergence of Chinese companies in general was an inverted U-shaped function of the degree of typicality of the industries in the population of all U.S. listed Chinese companies. This study contributes to category emergence literature by exploring interactions of multiple classification schemes. In the end, I discuss the practical implications of the results and give entrepreneurs and top management teams suggestions on sending positive signals to relevant audiences."
2016,"Collective action through identity work. A study on the United Nations. In this paper we theorize how (collective) identity work can foster collaborative action in pluralistic contexts. Empirically, we investigate the generative role of the UN collective identity in fostering a major collective action reform process in the United Nations system - Delivering as One. By triangulating interviews, non-participatory observation and archival data, we develop a processual multilevel analysis of identity work and collective action that links the global discourse at the transnational level with the micro interactions at the local level. Our analysis provides three contributions to the literature on identity work, collective action in interorganizational domains and bottom-up institutionalization. First, we develop a structuration perspective on identity work theorizing collective identity as both a process and an outcome. Second, we contribute to recent debates on collective identities in inter-organizational settings by studying identity dynamics in contexts of institutional plurality. Third, we advance a multilevel perspective on the collective action problem by unpacking the role of collective identity in collaborative practice consolidation."
2016,"Variation in the Adoption of a Diffusing Practice: Instruction in English in Turkish Universities Increasing evidence shows that both the content and extent of diffusing practices may vary across organizations and over time. Although there have been recent efforts towards identifying the organizational and field-level determinants of this variation, the emergence of practice variation is considered as an essential aspect of the implementation process. Yet, the determinants of implementation are likely to be different than those of adoption. The present study contributes to the diffusion literature by identifying the institutional and organizational mechanisms that may explain variation in the extent to which a diffusing practice is adopted by the members of an organizational field. Focusing on the diffusion of English-medium instruction (teaching in English) in the Turkish higher education field, the study finds considerable support for the proposed effects. The findings overall suggest that institutional processes lead to heterogeneity in the acceptance of a diffusing practice across the members of an organizational field, which is an important yet neglected aspect of practice variation in diffusion processes. Variation in the extent of adoption is also shaped by the degree to which organizational resources are compatible with the diffusing practice. Further, these influences are moderated by imprinting of organizational collectives within the field."
2016,"Mritshilpis of Kumortuli: Exploring Normative Institutional Contexts and Work Practices Drawing on an empirical study of the work practices of a neighborhood of mritshilpis, or clay image makers, this paper examines the institutional contexts for practice reproduction. By unpacking mritshilpis everyday work practices, we focus on the norms that are infused within these practices. In addition, this paper identifies three processes  embodying gharana, mobilizing place, and enacting community  that mediate practices and their normative contexts. While our findings echo extant scholarship that illustrate how norms shape and guide practices, often to have a constraining, regulative effect, we extend these claims by illustrating how these very mediating processes enable the artisans to navigate changes in the environment, and create symbolic capital. In doing so, we shed light on the relational, historical, and spatial elements that underpin the durability of practices and institutional maintenance."
2016,"Caught in between: A behavioral view of new practice adoption during institutional change By drawing from the behavioral theory of the firm, this study explores the intra- organizational mechanisms through which organizations respond to the competing demands from multiple institutional logics. The focus is on how slack search and problemistic search affect the degree to which organizations in the midst of institutional change comply with the challenging logic, when the incumbent logic is still exerting its influence. Using a panel sample of 143 U.S. county governments reacting to the market logic advocated by the New Public Management movement, this study examines when the organizations are more or less likely to adopt the practices of outsourcing public services. Slack resources are found to be conducive to the adoption of the new practices until they are substantial enough to help organizations remain inert. The results also show that organizations adopt fewer new practices either when they have met the aspiration level related to the challenging logic or when they have failed to meet the aspiration level related to the incumbent logic. These findings contribute to the literature on both institutional complexity and the behavior theory."
2016,"Risk and Reputation: How Professional Classification Signals Drive the Diffusion of New Methods Organizational scholars have long been interested in why new practices spread, and their focus has been on successful diffusions that reach a broad swath of the population. Such a focus obscures important mechanisms. Etzion (2014) demonstrates that in instances of limited diffusion  that is, when a practice diffuses only partly through a population  classification processes are invoked: that is, actors may signal their alignment with one camp or another, and labels emerge to distinguish adopters and non-adopters. This paper extends this idea to professional classification in the realm of academic science, focusing on three methods that were introduced, and partly diffused through, the sociological community: Correspondence Analysis; Qualitative Comparative Analysis; and Sequence Analysis. Qualitative data reveal how the choice to adopt a new method can act as a signal to ones professional community. Quantitative data on publications allow us to trace adoption process more broadly, and assess how organization- and actor-level characteristics that shape scholars approaches to professional classification signalingsuch as institutional status and professional ageinfluence methodological adoption decisions. We find adoption patterns consistent with our predictions: Scholars at top universities, men, and others having a somewhat protected professional status are more likely to adopt the methods. Senior scholars are more likely to adopt early on, but junior scholars are more likely to adopt overall, perhaps because the potential rewards balance out the professional risks of trying something new. Taken together, our findings contribute to research on limited diffusion and the organization of academic science, and have implications for the management of scientific and knowledge- based organizations as well as science and innovation policy."
2016,"Decoupling by early adopters: a case study of practice diffusion This qualitative research aimed to explore how motivations affect the adoption and implementation of a practice under an institutional pressure. Interview-based comparative case studies investigated five cases of mid-size Japanese listed B2B manufacturing companies about their adoption and implementation of global talent management at their headquarters from 2004 onwards. The study showed that early practice adopters were mainly motivated by reputational concerns but late adopters were motivated by technical returns, contrary to the traditional theory. Also, the data demonstrated that the reputational motivation led to the lack of internal consensus and unintentional decoupling in early adopters, whereas late adopters with practical motivations had stronger consensus and implemented the practice more speedily. The findings suggest that the sensitivity to and willingness to accept external legitimacy, which are one of the stationary characteristics of individual organizations, may have played an important role in organizational responses. The research contributes to the debate over the institutional mechanism, with particular focus on motivations."
2016,"Shared responsibility for wicked problems: Reframing corporate responsibility Recent studies show that companies increasingly assume responsibility and contribute to the solution of complex societal problems, especially when pressured or implicated by others. This paper argues that for such espoused responsibilities not to remain decoupled from business-as-usual, a companys espoused responsibilities need to appeal not only the support of external stakeholders but also internal buy-in. Presenting a qualitative, interpretive study of a pharmaceutical companys reporting on sustainability activities, I show how organizational members amplified a framing of corporate responsibility that appealed to both societal and business actors by narrowing the companys responsibility to key contributions that align with the companys core business. Through several amplifications, the framing maximized appeal to both societal and business actors, and achieved the potency to promote corporate responsibility in and beyond the company. The paper makes three key contributions: (1) it contributes to an interactive framing perspective by explicating mechanisms that drive frame alignment; (2) it contributes to our understanding of how talk may inspire action by showing how organizational members construct and operationalize the meaning of corporate responsibility (3) it contributes to our understanding of collective action in the context of wicked problems by shedding light on the potential of value-based interventions."
2016,"Implementation of CSR in an MNE: a model of intra-organizational conformity This paper proposes a model of subsidiary conformity through which formal policies are implemented into concrete practices in multinational enterprises (MNEs). We argue that subsidiary conformity results from the combination of compliance, imitation of peers and policy internalization mechanisms. More specifically, the pressure from the headquarters related to a given Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) issue and the implementation of corresponding CSR practices by other subsidiaries both increase a subsidiarys level of conformity. And the consistency of the policy with the subsidiarys values, because it triggers policy internalization, increases the subsidiary's level of conformity and shapes the effects of the implementation of practices by peers and the pressure from the headquarters. The results of our study on the implementation of practices on 3 CSR issues by 99 subsidiaries of an MNE support our predictions and suggest that peers and the headquarters only have an influence on a subsidiarys conformity when the subsidiary sees the policy as highly consistent with its own values, pointing to the need to rethink strategic conformity within complex organizations."
2016,"The Dynamics of the South Korean National Business System and the Changing Spirit of CSR This study has two clear objectives: (1) to bring the dynamic view on national institutional frames (national business system), (2) to show the strong role of the informal dimension of the national institutions in understanding the local adoption and institutional change. With the South Korean case, I examined the way in which the public has perceived the business and society relation over the structural transformation of the national business system and how corporate social engagement practices have reflected such a shared understanding of the business and society relation over the changes of the national business system. In fact, the South Korean business system has drastically transformed over the 80 decades, even though scholars mostly recognize the South Korean business system as the state-led market economy based on a close collaboration between a few business clans (chaebols) and the nation-state from the economic development period (1970s-1980s). Based on interviews with the formal and current CSR managers and consultants and major news articles between 1920 and 2013, I analysed how South Koreans have perceived and expected the role of the wealthy, business actors, mainly chaebols in the history of the Korean business system towards the neo-liberal market transformation. This study argues that that comparative CSR scholars need to consider the spirit of CSR more actively in order to understand the varieties of CSR, and more theoretically that the dynamic view of national institutional environments and its informal dimension is important to understand institutional change."
2016,"Of Wizards and Foucault: boundary configurations of corporate social action in rural Kenya In this manuscript we theorize how and why boundaries that define a firms corporate social action are constructed over time. We examined this phenomenon longitudinally in rural Kenya, where we split two companies into eight cases to observe patterns in how boundaries were constructed in response to extreme poverty. Informed by Michel Foucaults view that power and discourse are interdependent concepts, our data analysis revealed that boundaries were constructed through one of two contrasting power- discourse-subjectivity configurations. Specifically, we found that the boundary of a firms corporate social action depended on the subject positions enacted by actors in the local context in response to a common discourse that both originated from and further perpetuated a particular power distribution. We also propose that boundaries of corporate social action undergo radical change when the nature of a firms relationship with external actors shifts to an embedded or arms-length one at a time when existing resource endowments available to respond to poverty are under threat. Our central contribution is that the boundary of a firms corporate social action is a result of a social process where actors co-create power distributions in an organizational field."
2016,"When business goes out of its way to do good: Theorizing postures of organizational benevolence In this article, we establish an integrative conceptual framework for explaining postures of organizational benevolence  i.e., profit- oriented organizations deliberate choice and tendency to engage in actions that benefit external constituencies, and where benefiting the other is in itself an ultimate goal of action. We distinguish two types of such behavioral tendency: episodic and institutionalized postures of organizational benevolence. Our proposed process model is centrally based on the concept of collective commitment and recent theoretical advances on emotion, cognition, and communication within organizations. We elaborate, in particular, on antecedents  i.e., triggers as well as vectors, internal and external to the organization  that are apt to mobilize collective commitment. Furthermore, we focus on the central mechanisms through which such commitment is successfully sustained over time, and how it is translated, or transformed, into specific postures of organizational benevolence. We contribute to existing literature in organization and management theory by (a) firmly anchoring the notion of collective commitment in this scholarly domain; (b) suggesting an integrative conceptual framework for examining organizational benevolence; (c) presenting several sets of propositions that expand on how emotion, cognition, and communication each play a distinct role within the process leading to organizational benevolence; and finally (d) by identifying factors that prime either episodic or institutionalized postures of organizational benevolence."
2016,"Leveraging Emotion to Catalyze Institutional Change: Examples from Animal Rights A small but growing body of literature has begun the project of uniting the inhabitants of institutions to their social contexts. I add to this project by offering an analytic framework integrating social movement research and research on institutional change. I suggest social movement activists may reveal the backstage of social life--institutionalized practices, beliefs, and values of questionable normative moral value--to mobilization targets in the hopes of eliciting moral outrage and shame. These emotions facilitate the process of frame alignment, making it significantly more likely a target will opt to support a movement."
2016,"Movements, Markets, & the Power of Living Stories This study introduces the concept of a living story, which emerged from an inductive examination of the Rainforest Action Networks efforts to alter a key practicesales of lumber products harvested from old growth forestsin the home improvement retail industry. Living stories are incomplete stories in which their narrators tell the story in real-time, from the first-person point of view, and where their audience is invited to become active participants in constructing the storys ending. Our results convey how living stories provide a powerful catalyst for meaning change in marketsone that packages a social movements diagnostic, prognostic, and motivational collective action frames into a single narrative targeted towards rectifying a social injustice. Together, these findings enhance research at the intersection of social movements and markets."
2016,"The Institutional Legacy of Prohibition It has been documented that social movements can exert a significant influence on the behavior of economic organizations. In this paper, I argue that institutional changes brought about by social movements in a given period may have lasting impact on an organizational form by altering the normative and cultural contexts of these organizations. I examine how the efforts of temperance movements in the late 19th century and early 20th century continue to affect the geographical distribution of breweries, even after the social movements cease to exert a direct influence after the repeal of the national Prohibition in 1933. Specifically, the dynamics of enactment and repeal of state level prohibition laws led to a path dependent process that created a regional character unfavorable to the founding of breweries. I also examine the role of religious denominations in reproducing the negative attitudes towards the consumption of alcohol and acting as carriers of the institutional legacy of Prohibition."
2016,"How Revolutions Shape (or Rather Blur) Markets: Initial Insights from the Arab Spring How do revolutions shape markets? Prior social movement research has focused on those movements that seek to work with the existing state to change markets. Yet, revolutions are a unique type of social movement that seeks to create change through removing, rather than working with, the existing state. Using a unique representative dataset collected in both Tunisia and Egypt just after the Arab Spring, we find that because revolutions seek to disrupt the state, they delegitimize formal firms (i.e. those registered with the state) and legitimize informal firms (i.e. those unregistered with the state). In so doing, revolutions improve the ability of informal firms to access resources from formal institutions (i.e. resources from state financial institutions, namely state-owned banks). Moreover, any firms that have a structure similar to that of informal firms (i.e. sole proprietorships) also have an easier time accessing formal institutional resources after the revolution, irrespective of their registration status. This study contributes to the social movements literature, particularly as it relates to markets, the state, and entrepreneurship."
2016,"From collective sensemaking to collective mindfulness: The evolution of online social movements In this paper we adopt a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative coding with network analysis, in order to explore the evolution of online social movements. In particular, we analyze the development of a global social movement in support of the 2011 uprising in Egypt. Our analysis highlights three stages in the evolution of online social movements: collective sense-making, collective identification, and collective mindfulness. We focus on and highlight collective mindfulness as a condition for the longevity of social movements."
2016,"Pump up the Volume: The Effects of Celebrity and Status on Newly Public Firms Access to Resources The general benefits of social approval assets for firms are well-known, yet the differences in their antecedents and specific consequences in different contexts have generated significant debate. We seek to advance theoretical and empirical research on social approval assets by distinguishing the value of firm celebrity, an asset derived from high levels of attention and positive affect, from those of status, an asset based on relative standing in a social hierarchy. We theorize that the two assets serve as both signals and interpretative frames, and that they have differential effects on firms access to resources  in particular, their ability to form strategic alliances. We test our theoretical arguments in a context characterized by extreme uncertainty  dot-com firms conducting initial public offerings during the commercial emergence of the Internet between 1995 and 2000. We find that status functions primarily as a signal, while celebrity functions primarily as an interpretive frame affecting how status, as well as another signal  underpricing  are interpreted by potential strategic alliance partners."
2016,"The iron cage of organizational rankings: How law school rankings affect admissions decisions This study examines the middle-status conformity hypotheses in regards to how an organization acquires critical resources from factor markets. We extend previous research in this area by investigating both the between and within-tier variance of conforming behaviors for high, middle, and low-ranked organizations. We suggest that the within-tier variance is strongest amongst middle-status organizations and that this variance is explained by the organizations distance to the top tier. We examine our hypotheses in the context of the U.S. legal education industry, observing how law school rankings impact student admission decisions."
2016,"Managing Multiple Statuses: A Case Study of Open Access Organizations may need to manage multiple statuses such as the status of their products and services, status of their brand and the status of their counterparts in inter-organizational relationships. However, it is less clear how organizations cope with these multiple statuses when affiliating with new and, particularly, low- status actors or practices. We explain how organizations uphold their multiple statuses when they need to embrace a low-status practice. The findings highlight the roles of status incongruity and status anxiety in organizational responses to address the possible status leakage. We contribute to the literature on status by developing a process model of status maintenance, and showing how status incongruity and anxiety influence organizational responses to multiple demands in institutionally complex environments."
2016,"Status Asymmetry and Status Improvement This research extends the well-established hypothesis on status endorsement in that low-status firms will improve their status by allying with high-status firms. I draw on social categorization theory to argue that a sharp contrast in status asymmetry between allying firms may initiate the social categorization process, making it harder for low-status firms to gain status improvement. Specifically, I argue that a moderate level of status asymmetry between allying firms enhances the status for low-status firms, while a large status asymmetry results in diminishing status improvement for low-status firms. I further argue that the above relationship is moderated by the degree of status inequality in the status hierarchy and the technological prestige of the low-status firms. I will examine the above hypotheses using sample firms in both biopharmaceutical and computer industries."
2016,"What do Rankings do? Understanding the Antecedents, Form & Consequences of Organizational Rankings The practice of ranking organizations on varied dimensions of performance has become a pervasive phenomenon across industries and organizational fields. A substantial body of work in management and sociology has articulated the inherent design limitations and significant negative consequences of rankings for organizations, markets and societies. Yet, rankings persist as ubiquitous features of current institutional environments and have become largely naturalized. This contradiction calls for a closer scrutiny of current scholarly understanding of the phenomenon of rankings in terms of their antecedents, form and function, and consequences. In this paper we provide a review of current research in these three areas and draw attention to several potentially fruitful directions for future inquiry."
2016,"Transparency: An Organizational Ideal and its Limited Applicability  Transparency often fails to yield those positive effects placed upon it by advocates. Common answers refer to micro or macro structural explanations and generally take a reformist approach: The message is that if such measures to render organizations more open are pushed far enough, they will eventually succeed. By taking into account the fact that organizations usually try to control and massage the information they convey, a structural friction between the institutionalized ideal and its practicability at the organizational level can be observed. From a reformist stance the Pirate Party of Germany, a party deeply committed to full-fledged transparency and willing to apply it to itself, is ripe for study. I examined the parliamentary group of the Pirate Party of North Rhine-Westphalia, which has been elected into office in 2012, in a qualitative case-study. My focus is on how it put transparency into practice and how it dealt with the various unintended and dysfunctional side-effects. Within the first couple of months, representatives reduced unfiltered transparency in a step-by-step manner in order to gain control over the information stream from the inside out. In doing so, they were able to (a) stop being exploited by their political rivals and (b) prevent scandalizations by the mass media. All in all, the case of the Pirate Party demonstrates that there are severe limitations to transparency  even when actors inside an organization are deeply committed to this value."
2016,"Co-opt or co-exist? Medical cannabis dispensaries responses to recreational-use legalization When recreational cannabis dispensaries first entered the U.S. market in 2014, how did incumbent medical cannabis dispensaries react? Did they emphasize their distinct identity as medical providers, distancing themselves from recreational dispensaries and those consumers who consume cannabis recreationally, or did they downplay their medical orientation in order to compete directly for potential resources? In this study, we seek to develop understanding of how local resource and sociopolitical contexts shape and constrain incumbents strategic responses to new category emergence. We propose and find that medical dispensaries in communities with weak sociopolitical support for recreational cannabis legalization advance identity claims that sharpen their medical orientation as the recreational cannabis dispensary density increases. In contrast, medical dispensaries faced with a local population that supports recreational use move to directly compete for control of overlapping regions of resource space by de-emphasizing identity-based distinctions between medical and recreational dispensaries. We further find that the preferences of a medical dispensarys existing customer base also influence the identity claims it advances in response to recreational dispensary competition. Our findings help to advance understanding of processes underlying the strengthening and weakening of boundaries in the organizational world."
2016,"Playing cat and mouse: How US dietary supplement firms moved between categories to escape the FDA Regulatory categorization is a complex process that is critical for firm survival and market development, but often gets overshadowed by market categorization in extant literature. This paper extends the recent stream of studies that view categorization as an endogenous process to the examination of the emergence and evolution of regulatory categories by asking, how do firms shape their regulatory environment to move their products into a more favorable regulatory category? We use archival data from the US dietary supplement industry to tell the account of how dietary supplement makers moved their products between categories and finally into a new category in the 90s, which largely fuelled their 1000% growth as an industry in the subsequent decade. Our findings provide a multi-faceted account of the regulatory categorization process with a particular attention to the various stakeholders and their strategies to enable/disable institutional change in their environment. Our story answers previous calls to move beyond tracing the evolution of category labels and provides a step towards bridging our knowledge of categories and corporate political strategy."
2016,"Protecting children and drivers: Agency in late-stage diffusion of legal statutes  Studies of diffusion have found that early adoptions of an innovation tend to reflect practical circumstances, whereas later adoptions become decoupled from such objective circumstances and instead reflect other institutional forces. This paper identifies institutional forces that drive such late-stage adoption through the analysis of the diffusion of DUI child-endangerment statutes across U.S. states between 1991 and 2011. The diffusion of these statutes is an entirely late-stage phenomenon since related legislation was legitimated during the 1980s. Evidence is provided that statute enactment is linked to legislative self-interested actions and bordering states adopting behavior. The results suggest that similar late-stage legislation be examined to find out whether passage is related to objective measures of the social problem being targeted rather than other factors."
2016,"Social Structures and Venue Shopping in Patent Infringement Litigation In this study, we explore how organizations can exercise a significant degree of agency when interacting with the law rather than merely complying with the law. Specifically, we investigate how social structures among corporate plaintiffs lawyers and judges enable plaintiffs to choose a favorable legal venue to initiate legal proceedings and help produce tangible legal and economic gains. Our argument explores the effects of social structures that arise from mere geographical proximity among lawyers and judges, as well as those that stem from common educational and professional affiliations among them. With respect to education and professional affiliations, we distinguish between asynchronous and contemporaneous affiliations, which refer to overlaps among actors only in place and in both place and time, respectively. Using this distinction, we examine how social structures can facilitate both social identification effects and tacit knowledge transfer about the intricacies of the legal process in different jurisdictions. We document the effects of social structures among lawyers and judges on U.S. district court selection and legal outcomes using data on patent litigation histories of 1,317 companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry from 1990 to 2014."
2016,"The Role of Sensemaking and Institutions in Regulatory Change: The Case of Medical Marijuana This paper examines the case of regulatory changes surrounding medical marihuana in Canada between 2001 and 2013. From institutional and sensemaking theory perspectives, analysis of how institutions affect sensemaking and vice-versa shows how these theories can be fruitfully combined to reveal how complex cognitive processes unfold over time. Social controversies invariably rest on weak institutional norms and pluralistic ways of making sense of them, allowing for the display of ongoing attempts to create widely-shared meanings. In the case of Canadas 2001 Medical Marihuana Access Regulations and 2013 Marihuana for Medical Purposes Regulations, attempts to change the categorization of marihuana as a controlled substance, the change in focus from demonstrated medical need of individuals to state-licensed production facilities and the criminalization of home growing show an interplay of attempts to create socially-accepted meaning systems surrounding medical marihuana and state efforts to privilege one form of sensemaking over all others."
2016,"Firm Decisions and the Emergence of Mobilization: Reactions to Nuclear Power in U.S. Communities Extant research in social movement theory has extensively explored the role that collective action plays in shaping decision-making at the organizational level. To our knowledge, however, scholars have not devoted as much attention to the inverse relation, i.e. whether firm decisions might impact the emergence and evolution of mobilization. In this study, therefore, we examine the role that three types of firm decisionsthe proposal, cancellation and completion of a new nuclear unitplay in the development of both mobilization against nuclear power and activism on other issues across U.S. communities. We find that a new unit being proposed within 100 miles of a given community is associated with a significant upsurge in anti-nuclear mobilization. Cancelled unitsarguably victories for anti-nuclear activists also appear to catalyze further antinuclear mobilization. On the other hand, we find completed units to be associated with an increase in mobilization towards other, non-nuclear issues, presumably because local activists are likely to channel their efforts on other goals once all attempts to halt the construction of a new nuclear unit have failed. Moreover, we find this effect to be particularly prominent in more highly educated communities. We discuss the implications of the above results for the social movement literature, with particular reference to the literature on the antecedents of mobilization."
2016,"Elasticity of institutions: The case of petroleum exploration and production sector reforms in India Most empirical studies on institutional change show that once change processes are in motion an old institution is inevitably replaced by a new one. Drawing on a longitudinal study of institutional change in the exploration and production sector of the oil and gas industry in India, we argue that not all institutional change efforts result in a new institution. There may be situations where the change efforts fail and the organizational field reverts to the pre-change state with the revival of the old institution. We suggest that while it is relatively easier to enforce modifications to elements of the regulative pillar, it is more difficult to bring about alterations to the normative pillar and even more difficult to effect changes in the cultural-cognitive pillar of an institution. We emphasis that unless the change process ensures that changes in all three pillars are aligned to support the new institution, the old institution, which has a certain level of resilience, is likely to regain its dominance within an organizational field. We coin the term institutional elasticity to describe the property of an institution that allows it to revert to its original status once forces for change have weakened."
2016,"Hubris and Activist Hedge Fund Success The growing visibility and aggressive tactics by some activist hedge funds raises the question of what determines whether these activist campaigns are successful. Given the lack of significant governmental oversight of hedge funds and their incentive structure, we propose that hubris is likely to play a role in explaining their success. Specifically we investigate and find that hedge funds that exhibit more hubris based on prior campaigns and their aggressiveness towards the target firm are less likely to be successful in achieving their stated goals. Our paper contributes to understanding activist hedge funds by examining how hubris may impact their success or failure."
2016,"IPO Exit Risk: The Timing and Sequencing of Innovation, Investment, Financing and Payout Decisions Barely one sixth of U.S. initial public offerings (IPO) survive a median listing life of 5.73 years. Prior literature suggests a variety of financial and management variables as explanatory factors for why many IPO are short lived. In addition to these variables, we look at the timing and sequencing of innovation, investment, financing and payout activity for all IPOs listed on NYSE, NYSE MKT and NASDAQ from 1976 onwards and divide the sample into survivors, voluntary delisters (acquired firms) and involuntary delisters. Our findings are twofold: (1) Firms that first innovate and then invest and payout later are more likely to survive, and (2) survivor firms tend to have less collateral, less debt, are smaller, unique, have been around longer and receive analyst coverage earlier. Our study contributes to a better understanding of IPO exit risk, and sheds light on the optimal sequencing of management decisions to minimize IPO exit risk and maximize firm survival in the post-IPO stage."
2016,"Institutional maintenance and the proliferation of hybrid lighthouses, 1950-2014 In this paper, we center on a technological change to shed light on the relation between communities, institutions and organizational identities. In particular, we discuss the role of communities in preserving organizational identities as enduring and viable in face of the introduction of a major innovation. Empirical analyses of the proliferation of hybrid identities among lighthouses following the introduction of more technologically sophisticated aids to navigation in the mid-Fifties lend support to our hypotheses."
2016,"Fields in flux: institutional bricolage during a technological shock. How do established institutions interact with proto-institutions during the adoption of a technology shock? In this paper, I examine the interplay between existing institutions and the proto-institutions originated as a consequence of a technology shock during a period of incremental progress. I depict institutional bricolage as the process by which new technology adoption occurs as a result of the active combination of elements from both old and emerging proto- institutions. I use a dialectical framework to depict three selective mechanisms at play: persistence, contestation and synthesis. By doing so, I begin to unpack the mechanisms whereby an arrangement is selected."
2016,"Consensus formation in non-hierarchical organizations: An inductive study Although the knowledge economy has been posing challenges to the key premises of a formal hierarchy, most contemporary organizations remain hierarchical. A traditional explanation for this puzzle lies in the presumed limits of peer-to-peer dispute resolution. We investigate this assumption through an inductive study of the emergence of consensus in non-hierarchical organizations (i.e., open source software development projects hosted on GitHub). We sample discussions on software license choices and uncover new insights about the resolution of disputes over strategic decisions in the absence of hierarchical authority. We find important differences between consensus around an initial choice (a Greenfield decision) and the revision of the initial choice (a Brownfield decision) in terms of the process of consensus formation. Our inductive data analyses also shows that consensus may be more likely for groups with greater polarization ex ante and groups with a larger number of participants, suggesting that scale and polarization may transform the nature of the discussion from a judgmental one to an intellective one. We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical implications of these findings."
2016,"Entrepreneurship in Collaborative Ecosystem Setting for Achieving Sustainable Impact Successful businesses cannot evolve in a vacuum, they must be able to draw upon capital, partners, suppliers, and customers to create cooperative networks. Business strategist James Moore first imported the concept of ecosystem to the increasingly dynamic and interconnected business context in a 1993 HBR article. He argues that a company should be viewed not as a member of a single industry but as part of a business ecosystem that crosses a variety of industries. In this way, he argues, 1) companies may co-evolve capabilities around new innovation, and 2) they may work cooperatively and competitively to support new products, satisfy customer needs, and eventually incorporate the next round of innovations. I argue that in the current age ecosystem thinking and new business models supporting a cooperation/competition mixture is especially of relevance for entrepreneurs who wish to achieve sustainable impact. The aim of the current study is to exploring these assumptions by using a qualitative case study methodology. I have studied a collective consisting of six independent mission-driven enterprises named Powered by Meaning Collective. Each of the enterprises have their own mission and vision, but the Powered by Meaning Collective has also an overarching goal, namely co-creating social enterprises. The results indicate that enterprises within the Powered by Meaning Collective both have their individual networks as well as overlapping networks. Across all enterprises there is a strong believe in entrepreneurship as a driver for change. Business models are set up in such a way that they stimulate more entrepreneurship and collaboration. Overall it can be said that the enterprises in the network complement each other and strengthen each other's business."
2016,"Collaboration Outcomes, Competitive Concerns and the Limits to Triadic Closure Organizational theorists have extensively documented the increased likelihood that two organizations will form a relationship if they have pre-existing relationships to the same third party, a phenomenon known as triadic closure. They have typically attributed this to the flow of referrals and endorsements across indirect ties. The present study problematizes the implicit assumptions behind this theory and uses them to identify two boundary conditions to the phenomenon. First, the valence of the referrals that the third party provides regarding an exchange partner critically depends on the outcome of their interactions: whereas successful interactions increase the likelihood of positive referrals that foster triadic closure, failed interactions can create negative referrals that discourage tie formation. Second, the third partys willingness to pass positive referrals regarding an exchange partner will be circumscribed by that third partys competitive interests, in particular the fear that it may lose future business to the exchange partner. Such fears are especially severe when the third party is more easily replaceable by and less attractive than its exchange partner. I test these boundary conditions on triadic closure and their interactions using a longitudinal dataset of the investment decisions of limited partners investing in venture capital firms."
2016,"The constrained referrals: How dependence and structural equivalence limit referrals performance Referralsnew employees who are hired by the firm through a job referral practicehave advantages in achieving greater performance compared to non-referrals, because referrals can mobilize on-going support from their respective referrerthe incumbent employee who has recommended the referrals. In this paper, we argue that referrals dependence on the referrers support creates power asymmetry between referrals and their respective referrer. This power asymmetry, in turn, can produce a positive impact on referrers performance, but a negative consequence on referrals job performance, depending on the stages of referrals career at the firm and on the presence of other referrals who are hired by the recommendation of the same referrer (i.e., structurally equivalent referrals). We examine these ideas using a unique dataset from a direct-selling firm located in Germany. We find that salespeople achieve greater performance growth as the number of colleagues who are hired through their referral increases. We also find that referrals lose their initial performance advantage as the number of structurally equivalent referrals increases. After the initial period, referrals who do not have other structurally equivalent referrals (i.e., solo referrals) experience lower performance growth than non-referrals."
2016,"Democratizing referrals: Market transition and labor market networks in China The effects of marketization on the use of labor market networks remain poorly understood and the underlying mechanisms  unclear. We depart from previous scholarship by examining these issues from the perspective of the referrer  that is, the person providing information about job opportunities to potential candidates  rather than that of the job seeker or the employer. Adopting the perspective of referrers allows us to disentangle the effects of two distinct mechanisms  changing firm practice and changing social expectation  that the literature suggests shape labor market networks in transition economies. Using a large-scale nationally representative survey of Chinese urban residents, we find job-referring is responsive to the introduction of firm practices encouraging referrals. Nevertheless, the likelihood of referring declines with marketization. We show that this decline is due to the association between marketization and the decrease in the likelihood that those in positions of discretionary authority refer, a change that points to changing social expectations surrounding social networks. Our results have implications for our understanding of a) the effects of marketization on labor market networks and b) conflicting roles of labor market intermediaries."
2016,"How friends-of-friends referrals cause network inequality: Evidence from a field experiment Network centrality benefits individuals in a broad range of contexts including health, education, and labor markets. However, research on mechanisms that cause actors to become central in social networks is scant. In this paper, we propose a simple mechanism for variation in centrality among actors in a network. Rather than assuming that differences in centrality reflect the quality or status of network actors, we argue and show that these differences may solely be produced through a structural process that emphasizes friends-of-friends referrals. After theoretically establishing the mechanism, we present an observational analysis and field experiment in which we intervene in the referral process. The setting of each analysis is a series of professional conferences in which we observe the social networks of the attendees prior to and during each conference. In our experimental design, each attendee is randomly assigned to one of two conditions. In one condition, opportunities to connect with friends-of- friends are highly visible to attendees, whereas in the other condition, these same opportunities are obscured. The findings of our field experiment, which we replicate across 7 different conferences, show that by minimizing exposure to friends-of-friends referrals, the effect of preferential attachment on tie formation is attenuated. Our observational data analysis of 35 other conferences furthermore show that the positive effect of an attendees degree centrality on tie formation during the conference diminishes and be- comes statistically non-significant after accounting for the attendees friends-of-friends ties. Our results serve as the first large-scale analysis of the relational antecedents to social network formation in diverse conference settings. Moreover, our research shows how inequality in social capital in large social networks emerges from local network processes and how a simple, low-cost intervention might reduce these differences."
2016,"Search as Conduit and CEOs as Catalyst: Impact of Government Policies on Firm Innovations Extending the theories of organizational search by incorporating the upper echelon theory, in this paper, we argue that while organizational search can serve as the conduit through which external institutional forces could exert impact on firm actions and performance outcomes,CEO characteristics can be the catalyst moderating such a role of organizational search. Using a combined dataset with archival data and innovation survey data collected from more than 4,000 firms in thirteen cities in one Chinese province, we demonstrate that government innovation policies can lead to a higher level of firm innovation partially via a firms enhanced search intensity---firms search information and knowledge more intensively in terms of depth and width.We further reveal that such a behavioral mechanism may vary due to CEOs gender and age.By linking organizational search and CEO characteristics to the relationship between government policies and firm innovation, our study not only contributes to the theories of organizational learning but also sheds light on the understanding of the role of government in innovation."
2016,"Organization Attention and Shift of Institutional Logic for Innovation:Evidence from Chinese Firms Building on the theories of organizational attention, we extend the studies of institutional logic by proposing that while firms selective attention leads to a certain institutional logic in a environment with changing and co-existing institutional logics, the vigilant and the executive aspects of organizational attention sustain the theorization and representation of logic shift. Using a unique dataset combining a first-hand survey to over 800 firms with archival data in China covering the time period of 2006 to 2012, we found that in an environment with exploratory innovation logic forcefully introduced by the central government, Chinese firms shifted their attention from exploitative to exploratory innovations. However, as these firms attention vigilance and execution were weakened by the decoupling behavior by the local government, the impact of firms attention shift became weaker as well. Our theoretical framework thus provides a deeper understanding of the firm responses to changing institutional logic. It also furthers our understanding of firm innovation in a rapidly changing institutional environment."
2016,"The Influences of Institutional Complexity on FDIs in China Using a World Bank survey data, we examine the effects of institutional logics on foreign firms research and development (R&D;) practices and performance in China. We attribute the variation on R&D; practices and performance to foreign firms focusing on technological and ethnic logics, derived from institutional orders of profession and community, respectively. Foreign firms that adopt a technological logic perceive their investments (FDIs) as a means to exploit technological advantages. They often actively engage in R&D; practice to exert technological advantage and focus exclusively on financial returns. Foreign firms that are directed by an ethnic logic, on the other hand, emphasize more on fulfilling the expectation of their ethnic communities, and they perceive FDIs as a means to become an integral part of a specific ethnic community. Thus, these foreign firms will limit risky R&D; practices and focus more on ethnic considerations, rather than solely on returns. To examine why some logics gain primacy over others under institutional complexity, we propose the concept of institutional carrier, which filters multiple institutional logics and makes the internal representation of specific logics possible. Our empirical findings in the manufacturing sectors in China support the presence of competing logics and the key role of institutional carrier for organizations under institutional complexity."
2016,"The Entrepreneurial State of China: Private Versus State Innovation in a Transitioning Economy A structural innovation model is employed to examine how the entrepreneurial activities of the state shape the process of indigenous innovation in China. Distinguishing between state-owned and privately-owned enterprises, emphasis is placed on comparing how a range of industry and firm level characteristics  e.g. technological opportunities, public subsidies, FDI, firms skill level and innovative success  respectively influence the process of private-led versus state-led innovation. In general, the results help to reveal that the Chinese state should become less entrepreneurial, in favor of further decentralization and marketization that will lead to more efficient innovation and higher firm productivity in both higher and lower tech industries."
2016,"Purity and Danger: Learning State and the Dynamics of Science-Market Hybridization This study suggests that the states learning may lead to the evolution of the science-market hybridization. When the Chinese state wanted to emulate Western economic development, it pushed the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) to start businesses in the 1980s. CAS thus launched a reform of One Academy, Two Systems, hoping that research groups and business enterprises could exist side by side (coexisting worlds). However, because CAS engaged in business activities that had nothing to do with scientific research, the institutional logics of science and the market directly confronted each other, stirring intense organizational identity conflict: Are we a scientific or business organization? The conflict unfolded the hostile worlds account of science-market hybridization. After the state learned more from its own experience as well as Western professionalization of science, it changed its role from a dictator to an authorizer in the 1990s, supporting CAS to develop scientific identity into its central identity. As CAS disbanded businesses that threatened the scientific identity, the science-market hybridization evolved into the mode of blended worlds."
2016,"Standing Together or Falling Apart? Understanding Employees Reactions to Negative Press Despite recognizing the medias influence on organizations, the literature has rarely examined how negative press affects the attitudes and behaviors of employees. While previous research agrees that negative press threatens organizational members social identity, there are theoretical and empirical inconsistencies regarding their reactions to such a threat. Based on existing evidence, it is equally possible that employees disidentify with the organization and behave accordingly or that negative press may even foster organizational identification and cohesion. To resolve this contradiction, we draw on attribution theory and shed light on how and why employees attach different meanings to negative press depending on the characteristics of press coverage, type of newspaper, and contextual information. Our key contribution lies in developing a conceptual model and propositions that clarify the conditions under which employees stand together or fall apart as a response to media-induced identity threats."
2016,"Dont Bury the Lead! Understanding Who and What Shapes Organizational Media Content Management scholars have found that the volume and tenor of organizational media content influences numerous organizational outcomes. This research stream, however, tends to focus on its consequences, while remaining largely silent on its antecedents. Given the medias role in influencing observers perceptions of organizations, understanding the processes and factors that shape organizational media content is consequential. To advance theory and research on organizational media content, we investigate the simultaneous influence of: 1) Who is covered, 2) What is covered, and 3) How journalists routines shape their coverage of firms. To test our hypotheses, we examine the volume and tenor of media content around a newsworthy organizational occurrenceannual earnings announcements. Overall, our findings suggest that the volume and tenor of organizational media content are simultaneously, yet differentially, shaped by an organizations reputation, earnings relative to analyst expectations, prior media content, and annual earnings press release."
2016,"Symbolic Management: Developing and Deploying Symbolic Capital For Strategic Advantage Across research traditions, considerable attention has been paid to the management of symbols as an important activity enabling firms to influence stakeholders attitudes, beliefs, and expectations. Despite this attention, a clear understanding of the characteristics of symbols that provide firms with resources to navigate stakeholder relationships has yet to emerge. Moreover, the organizational activities necessary to manage symbols for the purposes of strategic advantage are rarely discussed. In this manuscript, we provide a rational for considering symbols as influential resources firms use to manage stakeholder relationships. We assert the concept of symbolic capital to distinguish three separate types of influence commonly found in symbols: ideological, instrumental, and institutional. We elaborate tactics firms use to develop and deploy symbolic capital resources for the purposes of strategic advantage."
2016,"Great Expectations: The delisting of VC-backed firms and their influence on VC reputation Considerable attention has been devoted to the antecedents of individual and organizational reputation, and its benefits. However, less attention has been paid to the mechanisms behind reputational damage, particularly indirect damage that can be caused by the failures of associated firms. In this study, we address this issue by examining negative spillovers in firm reputations following events that befall a related firm. Using the context of newly public firms, we ask whether and how delistings of venture capital (VC)-backed firms affect the reputations of VC firms. Drawing on literatures from expectancy violation and reputation spillover, we argue that endorsements by VC firms create stakeholders expectations of newly public ventures. As a result, when these new firms subsequently delist, their delisting can also damage the sponsoring VCs reputation. That is, even in the absence of membership within a similar industry and the presence of contemporary ties, we empirically find that stakeholders expectation alone, whether warranted or not, seems enough to cause reputational damage. We also explore various factors, such as previous performance and firm age, that may moderate that negative spillover."
2016,"Reaping the Fruits of Failure: Learning from Failure and Reputation Do organizations learn from failure? While researchers have found the evidence of learning from own and others failure experience, others have shown skeptical attitude on the issue. This study suggests that organizational reputation plays an important role in how much an organization elicits lesson from its own and others failure experiences. We empirically tested our research questions using data on product recalls in the U.S. automobile industry from 2001 to 2012. Our findings show that not all organizations reap the fruits of failure. Whether an organization learns from its own and others failure experience depends on the organizational reputation. The results of this study help us understand the role of organization in learning from failure. This study also contributes to organizational reputation theory by connecting organizational reputation, organizational learning behavior, and consequences."
2016,"Unequal Bedfellows: Gender Role-based Deference in Multiplex Ties between Korean Business Groups Deference within a dyad occurs when one partner acknowledges that the other is entitled to privileges. Although deference is a well-known consequence of relationships between partners of unequal status, little is known on whether deference could spill across different types of ties between the same actors. This can happen within multiplex relationships, especially when they involve firms that have both business relations and personal interactions that involve their key decision makers. We combine insights from status and institutional theories to examine how actors behaviors in a business dimension of a multiplex relationship are shaped by the culturally- induced deference norms in a personal dimension of the same relationship. Empirically, we demonstrate that Korean business groups connected by marriage of their owner-family members exhibit deferential behaviors in a business relationship  evidenced by changes in their market entry and exit patterns  as a function of gender-based deference within the newly created kinship tie. Thus, we shed light on how deference spillovers especially those based on the institutional influences--represent a relatively novel mechanism through which one partner can extract advantage over another within a multiplex relationship."
2016,"The Effect of Entrepreneurship on the Financial Wellbeing of Family Members This paper aims to investigate the intertwined relationship between entrepreneurship and family from a financial perspective. We argue that the involvement of family members in a family business has important consequences for the financial wellbeing of business family. We formulate hypotheses about four forms of involvement: (1) direct involvement through self-employment, (2) indirect involvement through living with a self-employed relative, (3) direct and dependent involvement through working for a relative, and (4) family-level involvement in terms of the intensity of available work time that family members work in the business. We explore empirically how these forms of involvement affect family members' income. We use a comprehensive dataset that spans over 28 years. We find that family business involvement has positive effects on the individual income of the entrepreneur, while it has no significant effects for the other members of the family. However, the intensity of family level involvement in family business has a negative effect on family member's income."
2016,"The family-legitimizing environment and the prevalence, strategy, and performance of family firms Family-controlled firms (FCFs) are dominant actors at the global level, but their prevalence, enacted strategies, and economic performance differ markedly across contexts. We link these differences to a new construct, the family-legitimizing environment (FLE), which captures the constitutive legitimacy of FCFs in the eyes of a countrys general population. We measure FLE for 83 countries using a newly developed formative index, based on several archival sources and validated by an independent panel of experts. Using a combination of meta-analytic and archival data, we show that FCFs are more prevalent in countries with stronger FLE scores, where the population finds it easier to accept that families rather than other market participants control considerable wealth. We also demonstrate that FCFs are more strategically deviant as compared to non-FCFs in contexts with stronger FLE scores, where the population has greater tolerance for unique family firm characteristics. Finally, we show that FCFs tend to exhibit better financial performance than non-FCFs in strong FLE contexts. Identifying FLE as a contingency variable advances the sociological corporate governance and family firm literatures by reconciling and contextualizing the contrary findings seen in earlier studies of FCF prevalence, strategy, and performance, both in emerging and developed markets."
2016,"An Exploration of MBA Partners as Peripheral Organizational Members Drawing on primarily qualitative data, this paper explores the relationship between a Business School and a group of its peripheral organizational membersMBA partners. I define peripheral organizational members (POMs) as individuals who have a role within or in direct relation to the organization, no contractual agreement with the organization, yet power to affect organizational outcomes via their influence over internal and/or external organizational stakeholders. The partners in this study held power over MBA student decisions to choose a program and to later support the institution as alumni; and over the reputation of the Business School due to their interactions with potential future students and partners. They negotiated their position on the organizational periphery by redefining themselves in relation to the partner role the Business School conferred them, by expanding the scope of that role, or by distancing themselves from both the role and the organization. Depending on how they saw themselves vis- -vis the Business School, these peripheral organizational members required and offered different resources.	"
2016,"Who controls the Indian economy? The role of families and communities The elite control of economic activity is a matter of great public debate and concern, and research on emerging markets frequently notes the role of a few families and communities, which control the economy via chains of ownership ties. However, we know surprisingly little about the extent to which specific social groups actually control ownership networks and how their role changes over time in complex societies with multiple social groups based on language, religion and regional origin. In the Indian context, we find that the greater the number of community members on the firms board, the more nested the firm is within increasingly cohesive substructures in the intercorporate network. In contrast, the more family presence on the board, the more likely that the firm is isolated or peripheral in the network. Over time, the intercorporate network in India becomes progressively less cohesive, but community-led firms continue to occupy the most nested positions within this network, while family-led firms become increasingly peripheral. We also find significant variation across different communities in the extent to which they influence firms nestedness within cohesive substructures. We extent theory on the social control of organizations with a more complex and dynamic interpretation of the role of social groups in shaping corporate networks."
2016,"Authenticity of Contemporary Artworks in Auction :the role of status and category This paper examines the role of status and category that affects the audiences evaluation on authenticity for symbolic goods when objective and stable criteria are missing. Based on social comparison theory, I argue that the value of symbolic good is determined by various audiences (i.e.,expert and consumer) with different sociological cues such as status and category over a number of stages. While experts evaluation is based on the global comparison by using social relations with prominent and restricted agents, consumers who actually determines the monetary value of the art work are more likely be influenced by local comparison process, assessing its authenticity in relation to the similar others that are being presented in the same context. To test these hypotheses, I observe the Sothebys contemporary art auction in New York during 2011-2015. I found the discrepancy between experts estimation and actually sold price (i.e. rewards on authenticity of artworks). Moreover, while relations with legitimatized agents such as museums, galleries, and academia are highly appreciated by experts, the perceived distinctiveness compared to others artworks in the same are more preferred by bidders. The results confirmed that status, as informational cues, generates rewards in an uncertain market, however, rather in relative terms than previously assumed."
2016,"Biofuels are (not) the future! Image mismatch and image work by hybrid organizations Hybrid organizations aim to blend commercial and social aspects of institutional logics and organizational forms to introduce and diffuse novel social innovations. Recent institutional scholarship has illustrated and investigated the internal responses to identity disagreements inherent to hybrid organizations. Drawing Hatch and Schultzs dynamic identity model, I argue that hybrid identity disagreement and coherence is also in part constructed through organizational image work  i.e. making sense of insider- outsider image mismatches (how do we think others see us versus how we see ourselves?), and the production of coherent and distinctive organizational images as a response. Using a sample of 15 biofuel organizations in the Netherlands combined with a multi-method and longitudinal data collection procedure, I investigate interpretations of image mismatches and the crafting of image responses. My study contributes to research on hybrid organization identity by showing that image work allows them to take action to manipulate outsiders perceptions that also feeds back into surfacing and solving internal identity issues."
2016,"Partners in Crime: Code Violation and Preservation Between Category Insiders and Outsiders How do insiders respond to the threat of change from outsiders of their category? Whereas many scholars have looked at exit options, we focus on members who stay in their category. In particular, we study the dynamics of code preservation and code violation changes amongst insiders and outsiders within a single category. Whereas code violation seeks to challenge status quo norms in the category, code preservation seeks to defend it. When insiders respond to code violation by outsiders, there exists a trade-off between authenticity segregation and competitive threat. Authenticity segregation refrains insiders from participating in outsider code violation, discounting the efforts as impure. On the other hand, competitive threat motivates insiders to participate in code violation. Thus, the probability of insiders to pursue code-violating changes exhibits a u-shaped relationship to the pervasiveness of code-violation amongst outsiders. This relationship is moderated by outsider code preservation. At low rates of outsider code preservation, the u-shape relationship remains. At high rates of outsider code preservation, the relationship changes to become positive curvilinear. We find outsider code preservation efforts to increase competitive threat and reduce authenticity segregation between insiders and outsiders. We use data from 152 Islamic banks worldwide from year 1999 to 2014."
2016,"Can Success Be A Curse?: Signature Products and Identity Violation in the Craft Beer Industry This study investigates a fundamental paradox in craft-based organizations. In order to achieve high levels of growth, nascent entrepreneurial organizations often seek to leverage a single signature product that has proven to be successful in the market. However, for craft-based organizations this focused strategy often runs counter to a collective social identity built on a sense of authenticity, creativity, and unique or even idiosyncratic product development. How, then, do craft-based organizations reconcile these contrasting dynamics? Turning to the U.S. craft beer industry, this study posits, and finds empirical support for the notion, that as a craft-based organization becomes known for a signature product (i.e. gains notoriety in the marketplace), the perceived quality of that product will fall. I also find that identity-based cues mitigate this penalty. Specifically, product proliferation decreases the penalty for the notoriety of signature products. Moreover, the cumulative effects of winning certification contests also serve to mitigate this negative relationship. These findings have important practical implications for our understanding of how craft-based industries mature and are develop over time, and highlight important boundary conditions with our current theoretical understanding of product proliferation strategies."
2016,"Authentic Kitsch: Donn, Vic and the Emergence of the Tiki Bar Social Category This study explores the social history of the tiki bar and associated phenomena from its origins in the 1930s up to the present. We focus on authenticity, which the tiki bar apparently lacks given its widespread perception as kitschy. Piecing together fragmented accounts and materials, we sketch a brief history the tiki bar. We claim that at no point of its development did the tiki bar represent an accurate manifestation of Polynesian culture or food, despite its popularity, growth and cultural embeddedness. Thus, the tiki bar fails any kind of basic test of objective or nominal authenticity, which concerns the provenance of an object. However, the tiki bar does eventually generate its own institutionalized social category, which is well known and readily recognizable by Americans. Many tiki bars fit the category well and possess type authenticity, meaning they fit the criteria for classification into the category. The tiki bar case is interesting theoretically because its growth and institutionalization occurred without explicit endorsement by the state or any professional body or regulator, formal or informal, as much received theory on organizational forms and social categories suggests. Also contrary to much theory, the tiki bar cultural form does not signify rationalized action but it does evolve over time in the expected waves of diffusion. We speculate that the development and acceptance of the tiki bar was driven by a peculiar set of status dynamics and the dominance of two highly visible prototypes and their entrepreneurs. Moreover, the conditions under which the tiki bar became a cultural form carry insights for future development of institutional theory."
2016,"Photos in a frame: framing, identity reproduction and (non)adoption of practice This study contributes to institutional literature on practice diffusion by identifying effects of two types of framing: framing of a new practice and framing of its end products, and their effects on identity reinforcement and the (non)adoption of the practice. Based on converging perspectives from framing and practice diffusion, this research presents key arguments as to how framing aligned with a dominant institution reinforces potential adopters identities, and how the identity reproduction facilitates the non-adoption of the practice. Using data on frames of a novel practice, bird photography, and the likelihood of the practice adoption among 2577 participants in the first American movement for bird protection between 1899 and 1920, event count analyses reveal that framing of the practice is aligned with a pre-existing institution that prescribes separate identities for men and women. The framing of the practice facilitates the practice diffusion among men whose masculine identities are affirmed by the frame. Framing of the end products (bird photos) based on the same institution is resonant with the mother identity of women. To avoid the loss of their identity, however, potential female adopters avoid the bird photography and their non-adoption of the practice conforms to the institution in which all the frames are embedded. Findings complement the institutional literature by identifying effects of framing on identity reinforcement and justification for the non-adoption of the practice."
2016,"Multinationals as Agents of Institutional Logics Institutional logics research has recently considered the effect that community logics have on amplifying or dampening the influence of other logics within organizations. However, scant research has looked at the role that MNEs may play in serving as carriers of community logics across the institutions to which they are subject in the various organizational fields in which they operate. The purpose of this paper is to theorize one mechanism through which MNEs may serve as carriers of logics and influence their institutional environmentsfacilitating the diffusion of proenvironmental institutional logics. Approaching this issue in the context of the international diffusion of automobile emission standards from 1970-2004, the analysis presented here demonstrates that multinational automakers played an important role in facilitating the spread and diffusion of community level proenvironmental logics. We contribute to institutional logics theory by showing how organizations such as MNEs can be carriers of logics across political borders."
2016,"Microfoundations of decoupling: from the perspective of coping theory In response to a call for advancing the microfoundations of neo-institutional theory, our work investigates the particular situation of decoupling, which has portrayed individuals with a binary view of ceremonial props and change agents. We do so by studying how seven knowledge managers, who were hired or assigned into the ceremonially adopted knowledge management structures of a multinational, perceive their situation and do their everyday work. Through an abductive approach of conducting qualitative research, we are first able to develop a typology representing different ways the knowledge managers perceive decoupling and do their job accordingly. Insights from empirical data inspires us to employ coping theory to investigate in better depth the working lives of these knowledge managers. We are able to eventually turn our typology into a comprehensive map organized around four archetypical trajectories: the trapped missionaries, the recognized opportunists, the disoriented escapees and the safe servants. These trajectories illustrate the reciprocal relationships between the decoupling situation and the micro-level of employees, thereby attending to the microfoundations of decoupling to explain why it persists from a micro perspective. These trajectories also pay attention to the role of emotions, which have been absent in present institutional analyses, in such relationships."
2016,"The Roots of Management Frameworks Management frameworks represent an integrative portion of management and organizational science. Drawing on management theory and memetics, we explain the roots, development and delivering value from the management frameworks. First, we provide an overview what a management framework is, along with a definition that encompasses the vast majority of components within well-known management frameworks. Identifying the roots and elaborating from them can substantially improve the development of management frameworks. With more appropriate frameworks stakeholders gain clearer information, improve their strategic decisions, whilst the performance of an organization is enhanced. We further argue that memetics are valuable for studying how management frameworks are developed. However, leaning on memetics per se is insufficient, rather managers should focus on refining the memes, which work or promise to do so. Our findings revealed that memetics, along with intersubjectivity, should gain more importance in the future, since they represent the roots of management frameworks and offer a facet for developing future frameworks. Additionally, intersubjectivity lead us to better understanding of the humans perception of new ideasmemeswithin an interaction of two entities. Drawing on that, we introduce network effect, which can support the explanation why some frameworks achieve critical mass and others do not. The purpose of the article is twofold, the usefulness for practitioners of merging memetics and management is discussed and a contribution to theory development is achieved."
2016,"How relational theorizing influences the popularity of management concepts Management concepts do not exist in isolation but a whole ecology of management concepts co-evolves and co-exists at each point in time. The discourses and trajectories of management concepts are thus interwoven and management concepts are jointly discussed and theorized. But how do relations to co-existing management concepts influence a focal concepts popularity? We take a relational view on the development and spread of management con-cepts to answer this question. We propose the construct relational theorizing to capture the underlying processes und to understand their effects. We thereby consider that throughout their existence, management concepts tend to follow a lifecycle consisting of typical stages. Which type of relational theorizing is favorable, thus depends on the lifecycle stage a man-agement concept is at. We test our framework by analyzing the co-occurrence network of 71 management concepts as observed in academic texts over a time period of 15 years. Our re-sults suggest typical careers of popular management concepts: New concepts profit from relations to modern and established concepts. Modern concepts have to prevail over other modern concepts. Established concepts profit from serving as brokers between other man-agement concepts. Outdated concepts need to relate to younger concepts in order to extend their lifecycles. Taking a relational view, we contribute to developing a more complete con-ceptual basis for understanding the careers of management concepts."
2016,"A capability-based view of sustainability-oriented innovation: An exploratory study Scholars have highlighted the role of sustainability-oriented innovation (SOI) as a driver of firm competitiveness, implying the transformation of goals, products and processes to create economic value while also solving social and environmental challenges. Drawing on dynamic capabilities literature, we identify SOI capabilities, organizational routines and processes. We base our study on an inductive-deductive, cross-case analysis of eight companies. The paper conceptualizes a capability-based view that includes three dynamic capabilities: incremental capabilities make continuous and incremental changes to the resource base, involving environmental scanning, knowledge and clean technologies, management systems and intellectual capital; renewing capabilities are concerned with market sensing, sustainability embeddedness and networking; and regenerative capabilities that transform the previous capabilities and the firms strategic focus, framing new sustainable business models, building organizational resilience and reconfiguring social capital and leadership. Our conceptualization contributes to the theoretical underpinnings of SOI and enables managers to systematically understand and apply SOI."
2016,"How top management teams expertise drives CSR: CSR strategizing at the CEO-TMT interface In this study we examine the influence of upper echelons on firms corporate social responsibility. In particular, we integrate research streams that have looked either exclusively at the CEO or at the top management team (TMT) as a non-hierachical decision-making body. Our empirical results provide support for the relevance of the interaction between the CEOs and their fellow TMT members as closely related but distinct actors in formulating CSR strategies. We find that TMTs with stronger output orientation (in contrast to throughput orientation) will engage more in CSR. This effect is stronger in TMTs of high average tenure and lower in TMTs of high average age. However, the positive effect of high TMT tenure is mitigated in teams led by CEOs with shorter career horizons (i.e. CEOs near to their retirement). We discuss our theoretical and empirical contributions to the CSR and TMT literatures as well as managerial implications."
2016,"Staying True to Purpose: How Commercial Pressures Affect Mission Drift among Social Enterprises Social enterprises attempt to address societal problems through commercial means, yet they are exposed to varying degrees of commercial pressure. Some scholars advocate increased commercialization as a way for social enterprises to scale their outreach, whereas others are concerned about the risk of mission driftan unintended or unanticipated shift in an organizations goals and outcomes. Drawing from organizational identity and resource dependence literatures, we develop and test a theoretical model of how major commercialization events, e.g. when a social enterprise converts from an NGO to a for-profit, affect its financial and social performances. Specifically, we hypothesize how organizational identity inertia (e.g., age at the time of conversion) and external commercial control (e.g., amount of received commercial capital) act as two competing forces that differentially moderate the relationship between conversion and social enterprise performance. We test these hypotheses using a proprietary database of 2585 microfinance organizations (MFOs)a notable type of social enterprisein 120 developing countries between 1995 and 2014. We find that while external commercial control helps MFOs scale, especially post conversion, it also tends to increase mission drift. In contrast, an MFOs organizational identity inertia attenuates such drift, allowing social enterprises to overcome the liabilities of commercialization."
2016,"A Microfoundation of CEO Social Values, Contextual Incentives, and CSR What makes CEOs prioritize strategic choices that lead to social responsible policies and actions of their firms? In this paper, we take an interactive approach to CEO decision-making to theorize how CEO social values and the incentivizing context (stakeholder pressure, shareholder pressure) jointly determine CSR outcomes. We develop a multi-level microfoundation that links CEO decision- making and concern for CSR at the individual level with macro-level mechanisms that shape the incentive context in which these decisions are made. Based on evidence in economics, psychology, and neuroscience, we propose that social values are the compass by which CEOs make sense of complex environmental problems. Values determine how CEOs attend to incentives and bias the decision-frame to yield boundedly rational outcomes that may vary in terms of CSR advances. Testable predictions are derived from the model and evaluated against the extant management literature."
2016,"The Advent of Environmental Disclosure: Utilities Responses to Public and Private Politics Recent scholarship highlights that corporations attempt to manage the impressions of social movement actors through using environmental disclosures. As a whole, these studies create a relatively ambiguous understanding of the relationship between movement activities and variation in environmental disclosure. In this paper, I argue this ambiguity arises because of a failure to consider both public and private political activities. To remedy this oversight, I explore the question of how public and private political activities shape environmental disclosure. I pursue this question within a specific historical and industry context. Namely, I explore the advent of utilities environmental disclosures in response to movement activities between 1960 and 1975. My findings demonstrate that public political activities, and not private political activities, are determinants of utilities first environmental disclosure. These findings highlight that utilities used disclosure to contest and shape emerging environmental norms and regulations. Moreover, I argue that the nascent environmental movement lacked the legitimacy to launch threatening private political actiondiminishing their ability to shape disclosure strategy. These findings add to the growing literature exploring both public and private politics. Moreover, it adds greater nuance to the history of environmentalism in a formative period."
2016,"Understanding Value Creation in Public-Private Partnerships: A Comparative Case Study Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) are an important form of hybrid organization that may, if properly designed and managed, generate innovative solutions to complex problems by combining different institutional logics. Using data from a comparative case study of the creation of two PPPs in the Italian healthcare sector, we draw on ideas from business model design to explore how complexity can be managed inside PPPs and how this drives the creation of value for stakeholders. We link the literature on hybrid organizations with the one on business models by looking at the organizational mechanisms and processes that are implemented in PPP project governance, assets and processes. We go on to develop a process model showing how effective business model design can help to bridge different logics and create value for stakeholders in the creation and operation of PPPs."
2016,"The Power of Distance: Systemic Risk, Local Risk, and Distance in Interorganizational Partnerships This study extends previous work on interorganizational partnerships by distinguishing the effects of external risk associated with the geographic location of the investment (i.e., local risk) and external risk that affects organizations irrespective of location (i.e., systemic risk) on the geographic distance between partners. Using data on 5,928 large-scale infrastructure projects in 160 countries, jointly financed by 2,647 banks between 2000 and 2013, we show that under conditions of high local risk, organizations form distant partnerships to increase their political leverage over local stakeholders. When external risk is systemic, however, they have a strong preference for proximate partners because of lower information asymmetry and costs of coordination. Our results suggest a trade-off between the internal benefits of working with geographically proximate partners and the political benefits of partnering with geographically distant organizations. We also show that the inclusion of intergovernmental organizations and local government-owned partners are potential substitutes for political leverage built through distant partnerships."
2016,"Bond Issues: Political Relations and Financing Capacities of China's Large Corporations The effects of firms political relations vary in different contexts, especially in the complicated financial affairs. Prior studies, however, mostly focus on such impacts in uni-dimensional matters and conclude with positive influences. In this study, I investigate such impacts in financial processes at the stages of firms market entrance, financial rating, and capital raising, based on China's corporate bond issuances. Corporate governance theories and inter-organizational research are drawn to study the effects of firms political relations which are captured by both government ownership and bond-issuance through large state banks. As shown in the results, the scales of relational effects are highly conditioned by the form of political connections, structural positions of the connected authorities, and the stages in financial processes. For instance, firms state ownership results in lower standards to enter the market and more capital to be raised in each bond issuance; whereas state banks are only bridged to more profitable corporations, which also leads to larger bond sizes. Finally, I complement these structured findings with two explanations from the perspectives of government capacities and industrial sectors."
2016,"Shifting Organizational Boundaries Through Institutional Work: The Case of Open Data in Berlin Research on organizational boundaries oftentimes assumes that they are subject to managerial control and can be intentionally set, expanded, or withdrawn. Our paper supplements this agency-optimistic perspective with an agency-realistic perspective that takes into account the inter-organizational structures, which constrain organizations in their boundary setting behavior. We illustrate this perspective by an empirical account in which a group of challengers was able to push a group of incumbents to change their boundary setting practices. In our study on the institutionalization of Open Data (which is a new form of digital transparency in organizations) in Berlin, we show how a group of activists, academics, politicians and professionals engaged in institutional work to redefine the city administrations legitimate options for setting their organizational boundary. Our analysis highlights boundaries as being institutionally anchored and identifies institutional work as a mechanism for challengers and incumbents to negotiate legitimate boundary setting practices."
2016,"A business network view on value creation and value capturing in public-private cooperation Intersecting the boundaries between public and private economic activity, this study contributes to the research on public-private cooperation. It comprehends how these hybrids organizational arrangements influence value creation and capturing mechanisms. A case study based on the development of a public transportation solution in Brazil is undertaken. Using a business network approach, we propose a theoretical framework of value creation and capturing through public-private cooperation and argue that the value is constructed through the complementarity of resources and the cohesiveness of motives of the involved actors. Our findings suggest that the success of the cooperation goes beyond the benefits from simply generating revenues, thereby expanding the value capturing concept."
2016,"Rhetoric, Counter Rhetoric and Institutional Complexity: Micro-Politics in a Mental Health Service Interest in the micro-politics of institutional action focuses on the use of rhetoric yet is still to explicitly consider how rhetoric works under institutional complexity. In conditions of reflexivity and creativity we suggest that inclusion of a notion of counter-rhetoric results in a more complete account of power relations. Reactive rhetoric recognizes the double-edged relations between logics in complex fields. We apply these ideas to the case of a mental health service defined by multi-logic and inter-professional relations. A framework of categories of micro-politics is developed that cross-references work done on language use with the rhetorical forms implicit in logics."
2016,"Multiple Institutional Logics in Nursing: Dispositional and Situational Experiences  We develop theory on how individuals experience multiple institutional logics in their everyday work inside organizations through a qualitative inductive study of nurses in a public hospital emergency department in Australia. Our findings suggest that individuals have predominant dispositional tendencies for how they experience the relationships between multiple institutional logics. We uncovered three typified dispositional tendencies: (1) coping with competing logics, (2) sensemaking using a dominant logic, and (3) upframing through blending logics. Dispositional tendency is based on an individuals construction of their professional role and social position in the organization and their apprehension of the carriers of logics. Our findings also show that situational influences can temporarily disrupt an individuals usually stable and persistent dispositional tendency for experiencing multiple institutional logics. Apprehension of situational cues makes a new logic from another institutional sphere of the persons life salient, disrupting the dispositional tendency and prompting conscious reflection on the compatibilities and incompatibilities between the newly apprehended logic and the logics already salient in the dispositional tendency. These insights into the dispositional tendencies and situational influences on individual-level experience of multiple institutional logics in everyday work have implications for literature on institutional logics and inhabited perspectives of institutions."
2016,"The Institutionalization of U.S. Medical Education, 1765-1930: A Weberian Institutional Analysis Following a trajectory familiar to researchers studying organizational populations, the number of medical schools in the United States initially grew at an increasing rate and then declined until, by 1930, the remaining schools had achieved levels of legitimacy and stability such that they could be described as institutionalized. We offer, first, a qualitative analysis of these changes, detailing how close attention to the original source of contemporary institutional theoryWebers theory of actionsharpens our understanding. We then use event history analysis to model medical school failures, employing data on school characteristics, population characteristics, and changes in medical licensing laws for 8,324 school-year spells. Tests of hypotheses deduced from Weber and from the neoinstitutional and ecological variants of organizational institutionalism support predicted effects on organizational longevity of professional associations, organization size, organizational affiliations, and population density. We conclude that an originalist (Weberian) perspective can strengthen institutional scholarship by (a) differentiating sources of organizational endurance based on legitimacy from those based on other forms of social action, such as economic interest or habit, (b) clarifying that legitimacy is based on actions relative to norms that are prescriptive and widely held, rather than descriptive or narrowly held and (c) explicitly recognizing that actors often acquire legitimacy by orienting to norms without fully complying."
2016,"The Risk Position Model: A Multilevel Framework For Managing Organizational Risk In this article we synthesize literature from several disciplines to develop a multilevel model of the individual, group and organizational processes that lead to the organizational risk position, which we define as the exposure of an organization to upside and downside risks. Individual decision processes are the core unit of our model, and we examine how human decision-making architecture has evolved to focus on loss, gain and variability, and with a greater sensitivity to loss. We consider how these orientations are overlaid with individual differences in personality and emotional experiences, and interact with organizational contexts to produce a systematic, yet idiosyncratic, individual risk calculus. Building on this foundation, we apply theories of groups and organizations to develop a model for understanding how risk-taking throughout organizations contributes to the overall organizational risk position. In doing so, we also discuss the cross-level effects individuals have on high-level decisions that influence both organizational culture and the organizational risk position, and how organizational culture and external factors influence individual- and group-level decision processes. We propose that organizational risk positions can be described, predicted and managed more effectively when the trade-offs between different forms of risk are articulated, the underlying frames for risk decisions are considered, and the interactions between individuals, groups and organizations are understood. Hence we contribute to the literature by constructing a comprehensive perspective on organizational risk, and we make suggestions for future research."
2016,"When the iron cage bends: The sources and effects of vague formal institutions Institutional theory explains how socially accepted laws, rules, norms, and values pressure organizations to look and act the same. However, institutional research has overlooked a pervasive, real-life characteristic of many institutions: they are irresolvably vague. Rather than setting clear boundaries between behaviors that are legitimate and behaviors that are illegitimate, vague institutions set fuzzy boundaries, and the difference between legitimate and illegitimate behaviors is indeterminate. We examine the case of vague formal institutions to outline a theoretical model of institutional vagueness, its sources, and its effects. We also explain how vague formal institutions may be a source of organizational diversity as well as similarity, and we show how vagueness enables organizations to negotiate institutional boundaries in a way that enables them to obtain sustainable competitive advantage."
2016,"Constructing Legitimacy in Interaction: How Consumers Evaluate Organizations on Social Media In this paper, we take a communicative institutionalist perspective and explore how legitimacy is conferred or denied by consumers on social media, a new institutional environment with multiple, partly conflicting logics of action. We develop a theoretical framework that integrates symbolic interactionist notions with appraisal theory (from linguistics). This allows us to analyze and show how consumers on a popular online content sharing community, Reddit, define communication situations and how they evaluate the legitimacy of organizations in interaction. On Reddit, a communal logic that incorporates anti- marketing ideology constrains how situations are defined and legitimacy evaluated in symbolic interaction. We categorize nine types of legitimacy evaluations which are mapped onto three dimensions of legitimacy: (1) object-related legitimacy, i.e. legitimizing aspects of the product or communication about it (its relevance, quality, and convenience in the eyes of the consumers), (2) subject-related legitimacy, namely the acceptability of marketer behavior within this online context (the perceived character of the marketer as honest, selfless, and respectful), and (3) relational legitimacy which has to do with the relations that the marketer has with the online community (their equal standing, active participation, and common ground). Relational legitimacy, in particular, depends heavily on understanding and sharing the communal logic of the participatory media context and seems to be difficult for marketers to achieve. If successful, it can, however, lead to a strong legitimacy as a member. Object-related and subject-related legitimacy can however also lead to a legitimate outcome as a contributor."
2016,"Signals of Novelty and their Legitimacy Signaling novelty can be an important mechanism of organizations to sustain audience appeal. We investigate when audiences perceive novelty as a quality of products. Our theoretical arguments combine the organizational literature on market signals with the work on categories, the main streams that this study contributes to. Difference-in-difference analyses of app producers update behavior in Google Play U.S., the largest market for mobile apps, confirm our hypothesis that novelty can be a normative value and belief of audiences: App producers implicitly make choices about signaling novelty when releasing updates for their apps and they face varying constraints of within-category mobility that determine the legitimacy of their updates. Whereas minor updates are appealing when within-category mobility is low, that is when exchanges are considered to be stable and long-lived, they are less appealing with increasing within-category mobility. By contrast, major updates yield significant audience appeal when within-category mobility is high, that is when exchanges are considered to be ephemeral and audiences are constantly in search for the next big thing."
2016,"Producer Exploration can Generate Categories without Audiences Category theory argues that markets function as an interface between producer candi- dates and audiences that evaluate those candidates. Audiences lump similar producer into categories in order to facilitate their search process, so that producers who do not fit into one specific category  or who span multiple categories  are penalized relative to their single category peers. I present an alternative model of the world in which producers in a market segregate into categories but without any reliance on an audience process: instead categorical boundaries reflect producers best efforts to ex- plore a complicated marketplace given their limited information about what audiences demand. Categories emerge as a cross-sectional consequence of a dynamic exploration process: At any given time, the world features a mix of high-performing producers within categorical clusters and low-performing producers outside or between them. But spanning positions are more likely to be occupied by entrepreneurial producers, and future categorical clusters emerge from their efforts to explore the terrain. As such any apparent category spanning discount is nothing more than the consequence of bad luck in the process of taking risk. I establish this result in a formal model and illustrate in simulations."
2016,"Going Abroad to Win at Home: New Venture Internationalization as a Legitimation Strategy While recent research stressed the importance of examining domestic circumstances for new venture internationalization, our understanding of early internationalization for venture outcomes in domestic markets is more limited. In this paper we propose that early internationalization can importantly contribute to new ventures legitimacy with domestic audiences. Building on the literatures in organizational legitimacy, we argue that early internationalization is a plausible signal for domestic audiences in evaluating the legitimacy of a new venture. The effectiveness of this signal is contingent on the context of the internationalization. We employ propensity score matching to construct a matched sample of new ventures. Our findings provide support for a positive impact of internationalization on legitimacy gains with three distinct domestic audiences: investors, partner firms, and customers and confirm the importance of the foreign market attractiveness as an important amplifier of such gains for some audiences."
2016,"The Artisan and His Audience: Identification with Work and Price-Setting in Southern India Using ethnographic, experimental and survey data from an Indian handicraft cluster, this paper studies the conditions under which individuals who identify with their work sacrifice financial rewards in their economic decisions. I argue that the monetary value that individuals who identify with their work seek for their work-output depends on their audience: when these individuals encounter discerning audiences, who are knowledgeable about and appreciative of their work, they under-emphasize financial gains; transactions with non-discerning audiences, however, result in a focus on monetary rewards. I further argue that the mechanism underlying this behavior is product attachment, where individuals who identify with their work develop affection for the output of their labor, thus preferring to transact with audiences who will take care of their products beyond the point of sale even if doing so results in lower payoffs. I substantiate this theory by demonstrating how handicraft artisans in India who identify with their work set prices for their products to different audiences. This paper contributes to our understanding of economic decision-making in the context of meaningful work by highlighting the moderating role of audiences and uncovering the mechanism of product attachment."
2016,"Complexity Science at a Crossroads: Exploring a Science of Emergence Complexity scholarship has flourished in organization science for many years, with important implications for managers, organizations, and networks. But the academic expressions of complexitycurrent publications using complexity scienceis dwindling: only 0.2% of papers at last years Academy of Management meeting were complexity- based. Has complexity petered out in some way? Rather than redouble energy in that direction, this paper argues for a focus on the core phenomenon that is studied by complexity, namely emergence. Two steps are suggested toward a science of emergence. First, emergence can be seen as a process and as an outcome; both explanations are equally valid and important. Second, the causes of emergence are not unitary: research suggests that we should see at least four distinct causal mechanisms for emergence. This paper presents those four prototypes, and reflects on the duality of process/outcomes in emergence, with the goal of incorporating them within a single discipline. Overall, my emphasis is on the flourishing literature on emergence in organization science."
2016,"Enacting Skillful Research Performance through Abductive Reasoning Few outsiders pay attention to organization and management research, suggesting we need to enhance our skillful research performance. We are uniquely able to address grand challenges that societies face since all involve organizing, but we fail to deliver on our capabilities because we focus instead on filling small gaps in our own theories and use constricted notions of rigor. I develop one way to enact skillful research that contributes to resolving grand challenges rather than just extend our own theories. Enacting more skillful research performance relies on abductive reasoning to cycle through formulating, evaluating, and reframing rich understandings that define and resolve practical problems. I explain how to use cycles of abductive reasoning and outline new criteria for publishing to support this enhanced enactment of skillful research performance."
2016,"Designing for entrepreneurship and emergence In the recent years, entrepreneurship has attracted growing attention in academia, business and education. Initially, the literature has focused on entrepreneurship from the individual perspective. More recently entrepreneurship is seen as a contextualized social process involving modes of organizing for both opportunity creation and exploitation. Even if the literature provides managers with some guidance on start-up creation, it remains rather parsimonious on how to seed into growing organizations construction principles for self-organizing and emergence. Through our ethnographic study we address this gap and show how a dynamically growing, innovative Indian high-tech start-up manages to dissipate internal and external tensions and stay at the edge of chaos."
2016,"Smart Cities: Logics, Practice and Hybridity in an Emerging Institutional Field This paper explores the structuration processes that occur within the highly dynamic and emergent institutional field of smart cities in the UK. Field-level institutional entrepreneurs have successfully driven this new paradigm to the point where smart cities have become the lingua franca of urban discourse in both private and public sectors. Through a qualitative study, we examine the hybrid institutional logics that shape the rhetoric and practices of institutional actors as they seek to garner legitimacy, status and optimise organisational outcomes. Moreover, in the context of practice adoption, we discuss the impact of discursive strategies such as theorization, and evaluate any potential impact on progress to the implementation phase. We also explore how three main logics  market, science and civic  are reconciled within this emergent institutionalization process."
2016,"Assembling a Field into Place: Smart Cities in Japan We examine the concept of organisational fields, a frequently, but at times with inconsistency, used notion to describe supra-industrial conglomerations of organisations with a mutual interest. We think that this term may be analytically very useful in todays world, of ceaseless technological development and organisations frequently traversing beyond their own industry to find new business. In order to explore the question of what kinds of activities give rise to an organisational field, we studied the early moments of an emerging field of smart cities in Japan. We argue on the basis of this empirical case that the driver for the development of an organisational field, at least at early moments, is more material, concrete organisational actions, which bring to life tangible objects of the new field. We provide this as an alternative to the socio-cognitive type of explanations in prior literature."
2016,"Dancing in the Dark: Knowledge Integration across a Simple Organizational Boundary This paper analyzes knowledge integration across a simple organizational boundary, describing how actors access each others knowledge from what is said and done, in time limited interaction. Existing literature has analyzed the group, organization and network levels. Studies have presupposed, but left unexplored, how actors integrate knowledge in face-to-face interaction. Introducing the distinction between exhibited and claimed knowledge, the paper tracks knowing all the way down into the fine details of everyday activity. Working with video data, the main findings show how far, even in a very basic organizational setting, parties are in the dark about what they respectively know; that knowledgeability is a commitment for organizational actors, rather than a purely empirical phenomenon. Knowing is an outcome of practices that sustain trust. This is linked, in the case study, to a series of organizational outcomes, such as missed business opportunities, miss-selling and a tendency to variously hassle, insult and bewilder customers."
2016,"Procurement Relations, Alternative Suppliers and Managerial Knowledge  This paper explores how procurement projects are influenced by the inter- and intra-organizational relations and knowledge of managers, and on the effect of competitive pressure on the use of relational assets. The positive effect of building strong inter-organizational relation is well known, but what is less explored is how this effect depends on the relations being built with well- organized partners where the managers are able to write good contracts and successfully manage employees with diverse skills sets. Furthermore, the paper argues that the use of relational assets also is affected by the competitive situation of procurement project. These arguments are tested on a dataset comprised of archival data on public procurement projects combined with a two-sided survey of both the public and private parties. Public procurement is an important field for research. Both because of its economic size and for the interest of well-functioning governments, and, from a research-perspective, it allows for testing hypotheses in a multi- organizational setting where the same overall framework regulates governance choices and transparency."
2016,"Regularity in Structure and Dynamics of Hierarchy It is commonly known that superiors in an organization can lead subordinates in learning because the former have more experience and organization-related knowledge. By combining empirical data for a hierarchical network and computational methods, we argue that even without such prior experience or knowledge, superiors can do better and lead in learning. In particular, our computational analysis shows that subordinates are more likely to learn from their bosses than from their peers at the same rank or their subordinates. We show that this remarkable order in learning dynamics arises from the structural regularity inherent in a typical hierarchical structure, where different ideas and knowledge are primarily exchanged through superiors who are more exposed to diverse ideas and knowledge across different subunits than their subordinates. Superiors are reachable to other organizational members in smaller steps than their subordinates. In bridging the component parts of an organization, individuals in higher ranks are more crucial than those with lower ranks."
2016,"Team Disseminative Capacity: Can Teams Teach What They Learn? Building upon the concept of absorptive capacity (ACAP) and its recent application at the team level, we conceptualize team disseminative capacity (DCAP) as the capability of teams to pass on knowledge to others. We employed an exploratory study using 34 semi-structured interviews with members of knowledge disseminating and recipient teams at a large multinational firm in Western Australia. The focus of our study was on how teams disseminate knowledge they have absorbed to other teams and sub-units across the organization. Our findings reveal that team DCAP involves the processes of knowledge co-creation, implementation, learning and integration. We found that intra-organizational knowledge transfer (team to team) was more effective when the knowledge was co-created. Antecedents of team DCAP include characteristics of knowledge, features of disseminating and recipient teams, the nature of inter-team relationships, and organizational factors. In addition, our findings reveal that increased team DCAP leads to extrinsic and intrinsic outcomes for disseminating teams and extrinsic and operational outcomes for recipients."
2016,"Conference co-participation as a factor of new knowledge creation: network analysis Scientific and professional conferences represent unique opportunities to search for new knowledge: representatives from leading universities, high- tech firms and other organizations from all over the world come together to discuss topical issues and exchange latest findings. However, prior studies on knowledge- and innovation-related effects of conferences consider such events as if they were isolated entities, whereas in reality the value of a conference depends on what other events its participants attended before and whom they had met previously. Our study aims to relax this assumption and account for the interconnected nature of conferences and its implications for knowledge outcomes of participating firms. We build on the notion that knowledge processes are embedded in the structure of co-participation networks and investigate how different positions of firms in such networks relate to subsequent new knowledge creation of these firms, using the sample of 470 small firms from electronic industry. Our findings suggest that some positions in conference co-participation networks are more beneficial for knowledge creation, while the other are less beneficial for that. In particular, we found that having a central position in such a network as well as being well-connected to other highly central firms have negative relationship with subsequent knowledge creation. At the same time, being a broker in the co-participation network has a positive relationship with subsequent knowledge creation."
2016,"Insider ownership, corporate governance and firm performance: Analysis of Indian firms In emerging economies weak external governance mechanisms persist and dominant insider ownership is largely considered as a means of protecting investor interests. However, in such economies not all firms are found to have dominant insider ownership. Taking the case of an emerging economy, India, the paper explores the corporate governance mechanisms for firms differentiated on the aspect of presence of dominant insider ownership. Obtaining two sets of firms, one, with the presence of dominant insider ownership and the other, without the presence of dominant insider ownership, we establish the corporate governance mechanisms that help substantiate the insider ownership in the first set of firms and offset its absence in the latter. Utilizing a sample of 326 companies, over a time period of 7 years, we ascertain the performance differences for the two sets of firms. Further, the relationship between firm performance and the three elements of corporate governance: board of directors, ownership and management, for the two sets of firms, is analyzed. The paper finds significant differences among the firm performance and the corporate governance mechanisms that impact performance among the two groups of firms. The implications of the differences are discussed."
2016,"Institutional reform and evolving corporate governance in China This study explores the efficacy of corporate governance mechanisms before and after Chinas split-share structure reform in 2005. We contend that governance mechanisms became effective in mitigating the risk of organizational distress after the reform due to improved shareholder rights. We utilize pre- and post-reform samples of matched distressed and non-distressed listed firms in China. Our results support that governance mechanismsincluding controlling shareholder ownership, institutional ownership, executive turnover, and executive compensationare effective in reducing organizational distress only after the reform. Our study offers unique insights on how corporate governance evolves in a transition economy."
2016,"Controlling Shareholder's Tunneling Behavior and CEO Turnover in a Weak Institution In this study, I reexamined the key assumption about alignment between controlling shareholder and manager under principal- principal conflict framework. I look at how Principal-Principal (PP) conflict can result in Principal-Agent (PA) conflict. Specifically, I examine how controlling shareholder tunneling behavior result in CEO turnover. Moreover, I investigate how such relationship is contingent on different institutional logics and how the influence of institutional logic change is contingent on the controlling shareholder identity. Using data from listed firms in China during 2000-2012, I found that tunneling is more likely to result in CEO turnover in political logic, while tunneling is less likely to result in CEO turnover when the institutional logic shift to market logic. I only found weakly support about the argument that institutional logic change is stronger for state owned firms."
2016,"The Effect of Executive Tenure on Board Functioning is Moderated by Board Tenure and Vigilance In this paper we examine how executives tenure impacts board monitoring and board advice provision and we investigate how board vigilance and board tenure shield a board from the negative impact of executives tenure. We find that the moderating effect of board vigilance is different for board monitoring and board advice provision; board vigilance diminishes the negative effects of executives tenure on board monitoring, while it exacerbates the negative effects of executives tenure on board advice provision. Furthermore, our results show that these interactive effects of executives tenure and board vigilance are contingent on board tenure. Building on a unique multi-source dataset comprised of data from executive and non-executive board members of Dutch financial firms, our results underscore the complexities of board functioning and show that governance scholars and regulators should not solely focus on reducing tenure of executive and non-executive directors. Specifically, our findings demonstrate that a one-size-fits-all recommendation does not account for the complexities involving board functioning."
2016,"Struggle for Power and Pay: Board Power and Pay-for-Performance in Low vs. High-Performing Firms Boards of directors monitor and incentivize CEOs to make decisions maximizing shareholder value; however, research is inconclusive in identifying the relationship between board composition (outsiders, insiders) and monitoring effectiveness. Integrating an economic perspective (agency theory) with a socio-psychological perspective (upper echelon theory), we examine how outsiders and insiders power relate to pay-for-performance sensitivity (PPS) in low and high-performing firms by proposing and empirically examining a multi-dimensional model of board power bases (ownership, prestige, and structural) using board structural and composition characteristics as proxy power indicators. Using 7,360 directors data for 680 firms from 2000-2006, we conduct a multilevel analysis to estimate power scores at the director individual- level, and then at firm-level for insider and outsider coalitions. We contribute to research by illustrating board powers relationship to monitoring effectiveness is contextual; outsiders power relative to insiders associates differently with PPS in low versus high-performing firms. As outsiders power increases relative to insiders, power positively associates with PPS, but this relationship varies based on performance. In low-performing firms, we find substitution effects both between prestige and ownership power bases and between prestige and structural power bases, while in high-performing firms, we find a complementary effect between prestige power and ownership power bases."
2016,"Individuals attachment to dominant institutional prescriptions: The role of fantasy and emotion  The research presented in this paper illustrates how fantasy and emotions shape individuals attachment to dominant institutional prescriptions. The paper highlights the role of fantasy in understanding how individuals are bound to institutional logics. An analysis was undertaken of the fantasmatic frames and emotions of two Directors in the homecare field in France, who were subject to the same institutional order and its overarching logic. Despite being exposed to similar prescribed goals and means, each Director enacted the logic in opposite ways. It is proposed that their opposing interpretations are partly driven by the logics inconsistency, allowing them to confer different meanings to the master signifiers of the field. Paradoxically, the Directors opposing reactions both result in the reinforcement of the dominant institutional logic. The findings inform a critique of a common assumption  that the institutional logics guiding organizations and individuals are stable in their prescriptions. It is argued that institutional logics are inconsistent and incomplete, and that this insight is important in understanding and acting on the unfolding nature of institutional prescriptions."
2016,"Actor As Abstraction And Metaphor In Institutional Theory The term actor has become a central construct in institutional theory, and yet remains unexamined and taken-for-granted. The proliferation and profusion of its uses and meanings encompass a broad range of social entities at individual to global levels in society and also from empirical observations of unique entities to general typologies. We interrogate the construct as a form of metaphor and abstraction and demonstrate that the construct has been stretched far too thin across levels of society and levels of generality and acquired surplus meanings and uses at the expense of theoretical clarity and precision. We discuss how the taken-for-grantedness of actor can undermine theoretical development by obscuring incompatible ontologies of actors and the relationship between actors and institutions. While we problematize the constructs rampant uses, our intention is not to purge it, but to advocate for more appropriate and productive uses that would clarify its theoretical and empirical role. In this spirit, we chart a course whereby institutional theory can stay true to its roots and explain an increasingly complex world."
2016,"The practical relevance of management research from the practitioners' perspective  Even though the literature on practical relevance holds that practical relevance is actively constructed by practitioners who make academic knowledge relevant according to their organizational contexts and existing knowledge, the practitioners' perspective on relevance has received very little attention from researchers interested in the practical relevance of management research. Drawing on practitioners' accounts of the relevance of academic concepts, this paper examines how practitioners construct academic knowledge as practically relevant. A theoretical model of practitioners relevance construction is developed that shows that practitioners construct academic knowledge as relevant if they (1) match academic knowledge against their contextual problems and previous knowledge, (2) extend their knowledge by new instruments, constructs and scientific framing and (3) consider the value of academic knowledge for their particular contexts and professional practices. This model extends existing research on practical relevance by showing the mechanisms of practitioners' construction of relevance of academic knowledge. Additionally it is shown that in contrast to the commonly held assumption that the ambiguity of academic knowledge increases the chances of being practically relevant, ambiguous academic knowledge can also decrease the chances that practitioners construct it as relevant if it provides multiple courses of action, which overwhelm practitioners with choosing the course of action that is most meaningful to them."
2016,"The Evolution of Competitive Identity: US Airlines 1978-2014 Theories of organizational identity focus on identity as central and enduring characteristics of a firm. We advance the construct of competitive identity, which is defined as perceived strategic relationship a focal firm has with another rival at any given point in time in a given market. It includes two main components: who are our competitors and how we compete. It differs from the concept of organizational identity because it is relational and dynamic by nature. We craft a historical narrative of competition in the US airline industry over the last three decades to identity changes in firm competitive identity and to explore triggers of those changes."
2016,"Constructing risk objects and their controllability in the insurance industry This study examines the interrelationship between the social construction of a risk object and the associated means of controlling it within organizations. Drawing on data from 35 insurance organizations, we develop a framework that theorizes how organizations construct risk objects along different dimensions of proximity/distance and tangibility/abstraction, which shapes and is shaped by how they construct their ability to control those risk objects as a matter of protection or capital efficiency. We show that organizations vary in these constructions of risk, developing three categories of Risk Protector, Risk Optimizer and Risk Jugglers. We explain this variation and offer an expanded conceptualization of the construction of the risk object and its controllability through three explanatory organizational features of centralizing, modelling and diversifying. Our findings are drawn together into a conceptual framework that illuminates two pathways that organizations follow in constructing and controlling risk: coherent pathways (with consistent either/or choices) or composite pathways (individual both/and approaches). In doing so, we theoretically extend the notion of the risk object within organizational studies and provide a platform for additional studies into this important but nascent area of organizational research."
2016,"As Time Goes By: The Signaling Role of Top Management Team Heterogeneity on Firm Outcomes We investigate top management team (TMT) heterogeneity as a signal to investors about the quality of young firms. Specifically we test whether TMT heterogeneity confirms the initial beliefs about it as a signal. This self-confirming feedback would indicate conditions for a signaling equilibrium, which is a key condition for a signal to reliably distinguish between good and bad quality (Spence, 1973). Our results indeed show evidence of self-confirming feedback about TMT heterogeneity. Specifically, we find that investors support young firms with diverse TMTs (measured by increase market capitalization) despite the diverse TMTs negative effect on firm performance (measured by return on assets); however, over time, we find that TMT heterogeneity becomes beneficial for firm performance, confirming the investors initial beliefs about the signal. Additionally, over time as investors gain more information about the firms quality through its performance they will rely less on TMT heterogeneity as a signal of such quality. Finally, we find that additional uncertainty that comes from environmental dynamism also plays an even more positive moderating role for TMT heterogeneity and investor support. Highlighted in our investigation is the importance of time when exploring the relationship between the composition of TMTs and firm outcomes. We conduct our empirical study on firms in China, where investors especially rely on TMT heterogeneity as a signal of firm quality. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for theory and practice."
2016,"Being, Doing, & Creating Community: Social Exchange & The Microfoundations of Institutional Logics A key catalyst in the reorientation of institutional theory towards microfoundations and cross-level change has been the institutional logics perspective. However disciplinary boundaries have resulted in a model heavily influenced by symbolic interaction and, simultaneously, the omission of social exchange perspectives, despite the benefits that the theoretical integration of sociological approaches to social exchange. These include furthering our understanding of the microfoundations of institutions, conceptualizing processes of institutional reproduction, and theorizing institutional effects. I demonstrate these benefits using a community supported agriculture (CSA) organization as a theory-building case. I show how the community institutional logic, accessible to members via the CSAs organizational identity, reproduces itself by supporting cognitive and affective outcomes conducive to organizational identification and positive group affect. This happens both because the community logic makes cohesion-compatible forms of social exchange happen more often, and because the community logic serves as a sensemaking resource that allows members to reframe cohesion-incompatible forms of exchange in cohesion-compatible ways."
2016,"Collective Identification in Framing Contests: An Interaction Perspective While scholars have explained how frames gets transformed during framing contest in a process of collective negotiation of meaning, less attention has been given to the process of strategic agency in framing contest, where instigators strategically amplify their frame while ensuring the frame is focused enough to enable effective action. Through a study of the anti-plastic pollution social movement during its coalescence, we showed a new process of framing amplification driven by collective identification. We found that instigators in framing contests compensated possible discrepancies on the diagnostic and prognostic elements of the frame with a sense of affinity and shared membership. We argued that attention to collective identification is especially important with online organizing due to limited face-to- face contact. We contribute to the framing theory in three distinct ways: first by describing a process of framing amplification leading to collective action; second, by shelling the process of negotiation in framing contest explaining the mechanism of frame compensation; third, by analyzing collective identification as a process of framing instead of an outcome."
2016,"Identity and Paradigm Shift within the Microfoundations of Institutionalism The concept of identity at the microfoundations in institutional theory remains deeply divided between the social psychology approach, specifically based on social identity theory (SIT), and the micro-sociological approach, exemplified by Watson (2008). In order for a more robust understanding of the micro- foundations of macro-processes in institutions, the definition of identity must be clarified. In order to do so, I explore the theoretical assumptions of each approach toward identities and discuss its implications for institutionalism. Inspired by Burrell and Morgan (1979), I also locate these approaches on identities and institutions on paradigmatic map of influential institutional theories and terminologies. Because institutionalist research is undergoing a paradigm shift toward enabling theories with a more subjective understanding of reality and an appreciation for radical change, I argue that SIT is not sufficient to understand peoples identities due to its overwhelmingly cognitive bias. Instead, a micro-sociological concept of identity that incorporates the socio-emotional nature of personhood would better illuminate the process by which people and their identities are socially embedded in organizations and institutions."
2016,"Escaping Identity Loss: Bouncing Back to Create a New Positive Work Identity Although individuals often value work identities, sometimes events lead to the termination of these identities, creating a situation in which people struggle to find a new positive work identity. Building on the theories of identity and escape from self, we develop an escape model of work-identity loss. Specifically, individuals who lose a valued work identity eventually hit bottom, which can lead to a path to recovery or a path to dysfunction (with some oscillation likely occurring between the two during the recovery process). The path to recovery involves escape through identity play and the oscillation between disciplined identity play and identity work. The path to dysfunction involves escape though cognitive deconstruction. Regulatory focus is important in distinguishing between those who engage in identity play to generate possible new positive identities (i.e., promotion focus) from those who engage in cognitive dysfunction (i.e., prevention focus) and between those who engage both identity play and identity work to move toward a positive new identity and those who become stuck in continuous play."
2016,"Embeddedness between Investment Banks and Acquisition Premium in M&A; Embeddedness between agents may critically influence principals because many business transactions these days are largely conducted by agents which represent the principals. This study explores how embeddedness between agents affects their principals by focusing on agents opportunistic inclination. Using data of investment banks on M&A; and acquisition premium, this study found that acquisition premium are likely to increase with the embeddedness between investment banks, indicating that embeddedness between agents may deteriorate agency concerns of an acquirer. This study also found that embeddedness between acquirer and its advisor negatively moderates this effect of embeddedness between advisors. This result implies that embeddedness between principal and agent serves to mitigate agency concerns. The findings of this study provide a new approach to study M&A; premium by emphasizing the embeddedness between agents as a critical consideration in M&A; deal."
2016,"Overcoming Organizational Silos: Role of New Clients in Post-Merger Integration Since an organization is ideally expected to be a cooperative system among organizational members, the phenomena of organizational silos, as exemplified by insufficient or lack of communication and mutual support beyond any subunits of an organization, would greatly reduce the efficiency and effectiveness of the organization. While the silo phenomena can be seen everywhere regardless of types and sizes of any organizations, or contexts with which organizations are embedded, we especially focus on the phenomena of organizational silos in the phase of post-merger integration because a merger process itself urges existing organizational members to notice their silo mentality between a merging firm and a merged firm, and it also enforces them to change their behaviors that could serve to organizational integration. 	In order to examine the issues of how and to what extent organizational silos could be overcome over time in the longitudinal process of post-merger integration, we use data on Japanese audit firm partners who experienced one of the largest merger cases occurred in the mid 1980s, later became the largest audit firm in Japan in the 2000s and thereafter. By examining the longitudinal evolution of the client-professional (accountants) relationship and audit firm-professional relationship respectively before and after the merger experience, we investigate the degree of client-sharing behaviors between members of a merging firm and those of a merged firm after the merger. Based on the examination of collaborations among individual partners who used to be affiliated with a merging firm or a merged firm, we found that 1) inter-unit collaboration as a driver of organizational integration is not symmetrically observed between a merging firm and a merged firm.; 2) the importance of inter-generational collaboration becomes larger over time.; 3) inter-unit collaboration and inter-generational collaboration are more frequently observed for the newly acquired clients rather than the old clients before the merger. 	Finally, rather than importance of adopting new internal organizational practices, we suggest that the success of merger through organizational integration that results in dissolution of organizational silos depends more on how many new clients are acquired after the merger."
2016,"Scope strategies: the choice of optimal organizational forms Meaningful organizations maximize welfare. In a context of incomplete contracts, we draw from the resource-based view, transaction costs economics and the property rights theory to propose a formal framework where optimal organizational forms are chosen to maximize all agents incentives and hence welfare. We reveal the emergence of several types of optimal organizations, such as mergers, acquisitions, contractual alliances, joint ventures, licensing, franchising, exclusive contracts, or arms length relationships. Optimal organizations are determined by the type of agents, assets and investment, and the strength of asset relatedness."
2016,"Dueling Spouses. Power Games and Relational Metaphors in Post-Acquisition Integration Our qualitative and longitudinal study depicts the successful post-acquisition integration of a German company within an Italian MNC as a sequence of both cooperative and conflictual power games. Building on longitudinal empirical evidence, the process of post-acquisition integration is conceptualized as the merger between two different institutional power fields each of them organized around a specific logic. The cognitive and practical role of relational metaphors - i.e. honeymoon and duel - in managing ambiguity along the integration process is taken into account. Our research contributes to the current debate between organizational studies and international management literatures and proposes a theoretical model connecting different power games and relational metaphors in processes of post-acquisition integration."
2016,"The Inseparability of Coordination and Space Current research provides little insight about how space and coordination are mutually shaping. The influence of space and spatial configuration is especially important in knowledge settings where work is built around material arrangements such as space, objects, bodies and things-in-use. This paper investigates how expertise coordination unfolds when work implicates space in a significant way and space is dramatically altered. To answer this research question, we undertake a 14 month ethnography (currently on-going) that involves the merger and relocation of two neonatal intensive care units in Canadas largest health system network. In this setting, two groups of clinical staff with complementary expertise and differing baby populations are brought together in a radically altered physical layout of a newly built super hospital facility. We find that space can reconfigure task dependencies and uncertainties while hindering expertise integration. These complications trigger planned and/or improvised organizational responses each with unforeseen consequences. The resultant interplay of unanticipated influences, organizing consequences and in-situ responses results in a messy unfolding coordination trajectory. This complex trajectory continues to expose new ways of organizing that emerge over time."
2016,"Social Valuation Across Multiple Audiences How is the valuation of an actor by a focal audience influenced by the actors popularity with an alternate audience? This question is critical to individuals and organizations relying on multiple audiences for key resources. We hypothesize that popularity with an alternate audience provides a signal about unobserved quality but, beyond a certain level, undermines conformity to the identity expected by the focal audience. The resulting inverted U-shape relationship, we further argue, is attenuated when actors have established a strong track record for quality, but strengthened when their track record is irregular and hence the focal audience faces uncertainty. We successfully test our hypotheses using panel data on 9,500 academic scientists at Imperial College London facing a focal audience of academic peers and an alternate audience of firms. Our work contributes to the understanding of valuation and socially endogenous inferences, and has implications for the management of organizations in complex environments."
2016,"CEO and Organizational Image, Organizational Evaluations and Performance: A Stakeholder-Centric View Organizational performance depends on three major determinants: What an organization does (i.e. strategic decisions), how it works (i.e. implementation, daily business), and under which conditions (i.e. external constraints) it operates. In this article, I combine lenses on CEOs management of daily business and external constraints by taking a stakeholder-centric perspective. More specifically, I argue that an organizations performance depends on the supply of critical resources from both internal and external stakeholders. These stakeholders resource supply-decision can be traced back in three steps: Firstly, stakeholders decision of supplying resources depends on their evaluation of the organization. Secondly, the stakeholders evaluation of the organization is based on the stakeholders image of the organization. Thirdly, the image of the organization can be affected by the image of its CEO. Subsequently, I propose moderating factors for each of the three functional relationships. Additionally, I offer a typology of all potentially performance-relevant stakeholders and discuss each moderating factors strength for each stakeholder group, respectively. This allows a more fine-grained understanding of the different stakeholders image formation, organizational evaluation, and resource supply-decisions. In total, the proposed stakeholder-centric approach aims at offering a new perspective on studying CEOs, evaluations of organizations, and organizational performance."
2016,"Reaping the Rewards of Reputation for CSR: Customer-Level Micro-Foundations Perspective Existing literature suggests that enhancement of corporate reputation is a crucial mechanism translating a firms engagement in corporate social responsibility (CSR) into its financial performance. Yet, the exact mechanism of this translation is not fully understood. We study the micro-level foundations of translating the customers perceptions of Reputation for CSR (R-CSR)  cognitive evaluation of organizational engagement in socially responsible practices  into customer affective attitudes, loyalty and patronage behavior towards the firm. The empirical part of the paper is based on survey of customers of telecommunication companies in the U.S. and India. Our results indicate that the R-CSR positively affects customer-company trust and customer-company identification, and subsequently customer loyalty, leading to positive behavior (monthly payments, purchasing bundles of products/services). Additionally, we disentangle the effect of overall corporate reputation (generalized favorability across all dimensions) from R-CSR, and demonstrate the moderating role of individual cultural trait (interdependent self-construal) and country context in the process of translating the perceived reputation for CSR into consumers attitudes."
2016,"Names, Emotions and Product Appeal and Growth in the U.S. Craft Beer Market, 1996-2012 A name is a central feature of any product, yet it is not well understood how names affect product growth  a key factor in a firms success on the market. Product growth happens in a number of different ways: growth in product sales, growth in product variety, growth in a products reputation. In this paper we focus on growth in the number of products that are emotionally appealing to consumers, because this emotional engagement may be an antecedent to many other types of product growth. We use product names to explain the growth of emotionally charged products. Specifically, we argue that names that evoke positive emotions in customers foster audience engagement with products with such names and increase those products appeal. One unexpected outcome of this process is the spillover of emotional engagement of consumers to other products in a firms portfolio, including those that do not have positively charged names. We predict that firms with products that have names that elicit positive emotions will experience a higher rate of growth of products that create a positive emotional response in consumers, regardless of whether these products have positive names or not. We find support to these ideas in the analysis of all consumer reviews of all U.S. craft beers listed on BeerAdvocate.com, 1996-2012."
2016,"The Evaluative Process as Constructing Heterogeneity in Object Category and Social Attention To understand how individuals evaluate objects, I propose a theory of evaluation that both identifies and explains the reasons why not all objects are considered and compared with equal intensity. This variable intensity is subject to the construction of heterogeneity of objects categorization and the construction of perceived heterogeneity in objects social attention. I argue that given the perception of a generalized #1 ranked item, evaluators discount in-category inferior alternatives relative to out-category inferior alternatives. The mechanism driving this effect is that objects that are perceived to receive less social attention face evaluative discounts because they are being compared to items that are similar, yet socially superior. I empirically test this theory using a dataset containing 75,133 user evaluations of 123 feature films released in the United States during 2007. In support of my proposed theory, I find that movies that are categorically similar to the #1 box office movie during a movies opening weekend receive lower consumer evaluations. These findings have real world implications for managers concerning product release, product competition and matching, and advertising."
2016,"A Classification of Structural Inertia Responses to Failure Renewing debate on the scope and placement of structural inertia, and as a test of structural inertia as a one-dimensional construct, this paper presents four different types of structural inertia responses to failure. Using a test of 6,084 firm-year observations across 52 industries, we ratify that clear response and performance differences lead to distinct rates of organizational failure, indicating that time and performance are far less plottable than structural inertia theory suggests. Adding to advances made by organizational ecologists, confirmation of the classification shows that a gradation in structural inertia comes from individual firm level reasoning just as much as it does from population level selection pressure. Findings help reposition structural inertia in terms of responses to organizational failure."
2016,"Organizational Failure and Decline  A Bibliometric Study of the Scientific Frontend In todays difficult economic times, the number of failing firms remains high. Theories of why companies fail have mainly been developed in a research field traditionally summarized as Organizational Failure and Decline. Unfortunately, this research field suffers from strong fragmentation and an unclear research agenda. The aim of this study is to structure existing research with the help of bibliometric methods and present developments in research between 1982 and 2014. Concretely, we perform a co-citation analysis and visualize existing sub-clusters of organizational failure research. We also highlight the most frequently cited publications based on a citation analysis and analyze citation patterns in equally sized periods. Seven sub- clusters define the intellectual foundation of organizational failure and decline research. While an organizational ecology and industrial organization perspective dominates before 2000, the strategic choice literature gains relative attention after 2000. In recent years, the consequences of failures for entrepreneurs and perceptions thereof dominate the scholarly debate. The main clusters are finally summarized in an integrated framework."
2016,"Inter-organizational tie dissolution:A literature review Why do inter-organizational relationships (IORs) dissolve? This question is hardly addressed in the literature in which most attention is directed at tie formation and the economic and strategic outcomes of inter-organizational relationships. This study focuses on a specific outcome: tie dissolution. In order to understand the causes of tie dissolution, we have conducted a comprehensive literature study analyzing the literature with regard to two aspects: 1) Which organization theories help at understanding tie dissolution? 2) Which causes does empirical research provide for explaining tie dissolution? Our study consists of an in-depth analysis of a total of 104 theoretical and empirical papers that result in the following answers: 1) Tie dissolution is predominantly explained with Transaction Cost Theory, Social Exchange Theory, Evolutionary Theory of Organizations and Organizational Learning Theory. (2) Reasons for dissolution can be categorized in environmental factors, network factors, relational factors and organizational factors. Relational factors dominate the landscape. The paper argues that the study of the consequences of tie dissolution is a relevant next research step."
2016,"Legitimizing Entrepreneurship Identities through Failure Narratives Despite an increasing interest in failure in entrepreneurship, little is still known about how it is made sense of by the entrepreneurs themselves. We argue that making sense of entrepreneurial failure is a multifaceted process that involves explanations in terms of attributions but also the legitimation of entrepreneurs identities. Through the analysis of 50 interviews with entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley we identified four main discursive strategies that entrepreneurs used in accounting for failure: distancing, embracement, re-scaling and relativizing. We contribute to better understand entrepreneurship by showing failure not only as a cognitive processes attribution and blame avoidance but as part of the institutionalization of entrepreneurship. We extend the comprehension of the multiple and intertemporal identities of the entrepreneurs and present legitimation as a process of cultural alignment and misalignment."
2016,"The Black Cloud and Nortel: Understanding Catastrophic Failure in Long Cycle Industries This longitudinal revelatory qualitative study of the demise of Nortel, a large global telecommunication company, investigates the reasons for organizational failure. In particular, we build a narrative and explore linkages between the firm and its environment. In order to improve our understanding of organizational failure, we theoretically refine organizational resilience and environment as two extant constructs from the literature. However, both constructs are insufficient to provide an explanation for the Nortels epic failure. We thus theorize a new phenomenon which has not been identified to date in the extant literature and turn-around strategies: The Black Cloud, a growing divide between Nortel and its customers, which led to the companys ultimate failure although its resilience and environment were improving. We further conceptualize a model of the Black Cloud including the four components perceptual difference, miscommunication, dependence asymmetry, and structural misalignment. Our study contributes to theory on organizational failure and strategy practice by providing deeper understanding and new insights on this phenomenon."
2016,"Rule Network Evolution as Discovery of Knowledge Relevance Rules are not isolated pieces of text; rather, they often become interconnected with one another, forming networks of knowledge repositories that shape action and actors in organizations and societies. In this study, we aim to understand the processes that drive the evolution of rule networks. We take a relevance discovery perspective to examine the formation of citation ties between rules. We argue that tie formation is the product of organizational relevance discovery processes. Rules become cited when they come to be regarded as relevant to the operations of other rules. In that view, citation tie formation should reflect the discovery of relevance of a focal rule to other rules. We develop a theoretical model of rule relevance discovery and derive hypotheses that connect the dynamics of the rule system and of individual rules to the rate of citation arrival of the focal rules. We test our hypotheses with a longitudinal data of 802 clinical practice guidelines in a Canadian regional healthcare organization that were in force between April 1989 and December 2010. Our results support the general perspective that rule network formation is shaped by relevance discovery processes."
2016,"A Market for Meaning: Framing Strategies in the Co-Construction of a Hybrid Market Category Despite informing our understanding of how to recognize the existence of categories, extant research has paid little attention to the dynamics inherent in their origins and the process by which meaning is constructed. Employing a case study of the emergence of impact investing, a new social investment category; this paper analyzes a variety of qualitative data from diverse sources, including participant observation, archival data sources, media reports, and interviews with senior and mid-level industry participants. Drawing on this analysis, the findings suggest that hybrid market categories emerge through a co-construction process between institutional actors who employ strategic frames to shape perceptions about the meaning of the new hybrid form. Through this process of meaning construction, the category gains cultural relevance and resonates with diverse audiences. The study contributes to the development of a process model that provides novel theoretical understanding on how hybrid market categories emerge and gain cultural relevance while avoiding the penalties associated with hybridity."
2016,"Hybrid as Gateway Drug: How Emergence of Hybrid Jazz Leads to Dominance of Traditional Jazz This paper argues that the success of a hybrid between an established and a nascent product can ultimately cause the nascent product to become popular at the expense of the hybrid. By invoking familiarity with the established product, the hybrid is more easily understood and accepted. Similarly, the hybrid also contributes to the legitimization of the nascent product over time. However, once the nascent product is better understood, the hybrids limitations may become apparent if it fails to incorporate the key elements of the once-nascent product that are crucial to positive evaluation and integral to the once-nascents appeal. Thus, the hybrid may gradually become less appreciated than the once-nascent. I test this theory in the context of the emergence of hybrid jazza combination of traditional jazz and classical music that was popular during the 1920s and 1930sand the subsequent popularity of traditional jazz during the 1940s and 1950s in the U.S. This paper extends research on entrepreneurship and market categories by emphasizing that the appeal of a hybridor a category spanningis dynamic. It also responds to research on product externalities by suggesting that two competing products can have complementing effects in the long run."
2016,"Unpacking Power in an Institutionally Complex Field: Community Radio in India  In this paper, we respond to recent calls for the need for a critical view of power in institutional theory. We address this gap by unpacking the power struggles in an institutionally complex field around the newly emerging phenomenon of community radio in India. We analyze the political nature of the conflicting institutional logics in this contested hierarchical field and draw implications for power using Foucaults power-knowledge perspective and Bourdieus concept of fields. To do this, we first assess the conflicting nature of the logics in the field and how any one logic can be problematized with reference to another. Then, we analyze the responses of community radio station licensee organizations using a problematizing lens of field actors. We thus interpret power struggles between unequal actors as manifested through the creation of boundaries and the constraints imposed by pre-existing boundaries. By doing so, we contribute to highlighting the role of power in institutional logics and complexity, and more generally into institutional theory."
2016,"Structure from Chaos: The Creation of Libyan Civil Society We explore the resources, actors and processes involved in the rapid emergence of civil society in Libya after the fall of a dictator regime. We conceptualize this context as one of institutional chaos, where political oppression suppressed civil society institutions, and the revolution then created an upheaval, a moment of instability and unpredictability. A multi-level process framework emerged from the findings, highlighting the important role of institutional brokers, actors embedded in multiple established institutions and the emerging field. These institutional brokers link actors and also transform ideas from other fields. We found that brokers engaged in a process of creative translation, recombining, transposing, and recasting institutional resources from other fields. However, once the resources were at play in the emerging field, brokers faced resistance, a not-invented-here syndrome. To overcome this barrier, brokers engaged in collaborative transmission, creating spaces to develop shared meanings and practices with grassroots organizations. This research contributes to our understanding of institutional work required in different contexts, and addresses a grand challenge of our timecreation of civil society after extreme political oppression."
2016,"Rationality in the Age of Analytics This conceptual paper aims to contribute to the field of rationality, by developing the perspective of rationality in practice, which entails a sociomaterial practice approach to model-based rationality. The paper reviews the theoretical challenges addressed by critiques inherent in theories of rational choice, as well as external critiques on model- based rationality from other theoretical perspectives. Taking a sociomaterial practice perspective helps address several of those challenges. In order to further investigate how rationality is situated, configured and reconfigured in sociomaterial practices, organizational scholars may study the enactment of tools of model-based rationality in organizational settings. Such tools of model-based rationality include the technology of analytics, which is often implemented to help organizations reach favorable outcomes following the normative ideal of rationality. The paper ends by setting a research agenda for investigating the perspective of rationality in practice empirically, by studying the introduction and use of analytics in organizations."
2016,"Relating the body, practical experience, and language in a theory of knowing Past research in the field of organizational studies proposes that knowing is more than a mental process  it also a physical activity that is learned through practical accomplishment. Yet, existing research recognizes the body in these practices in limited ways. Further, while scholars outside of the field of organizational studies have long acknowledged the relation of language to the body in knowing, they have tended to treat the acting/doing body and articulation of what one is doing while engaging in practice as separate and distinct rather than considering how bodily experiences and language relate in bodily practice more holistically. In this paper, we construct a theory of knowing focusing on the embodied character of language in skillful performance. Drawing on two ethnographic studies of the training of yoga teachers in two practice communities over approximately a year, we examine the specific gross and bodily experiences related to engagement in practical activities and how they contribute to knowing over time. We propose that beginning and more experienced practitioners both experience a shift in language understanding and use over time (which is evidence of their knowing) while they are developing expertise in the practice. We conclude by discussing how these contributions open pathways for future research on knowing."
2016,"Mode Focus versus Mode Ambidexterity: Solving a Dilemma Using organizational learning and niche theory, we develop a model of mode focus and firm performance that challenges most recent findings in the exploration/exploitation knowledge domain. We conceptualize mode focus as the simultaneous pursuit of exploration or exploitation across internal and alliance modes of organization. The model theorizes that following a focused strategy across internal and alliance modes of organization benefits software companies compared to following a more balanced approach across modes. Using niche theory, we classify software firms into generalists and specialists based on the amount of slack they keep. A split-panel dataset of 324 US-based software firms over 12 years yields support for our hypotheses: first, mode focus benefits firm performance compared to a balanced strategy, and second generalists benefit more from being focused on exploration across modes while specialists benefit more from being focused on exploitation across modes."
2016,"Toward a Multilevel Social Exchange Theory of Advice Relations in Organizations What motivates organizational members to seek and give advice, contributing to informal knowledge transfer and sharing in organizational settings? To answer this question, extant literature proposes two competing views. One view builds on social exchange theory to argue that organizational members try to exchange status recognition for advice. The other view claims that the motivation to release information and exchange knowledge is triggered by the relational dimensions of trust, norms, and obligations. To advance our understanding of the motivations behind advice relations we propose a unified view of social exchange theory. We test the hypothesis that advice seeking and giving are shaped differently by the presence of the formal organizational structure, which embeds advice relations in hierarchical orderings of various strength. Empirical analysis of advice seeking ties among the around 200 members of a multiunit organization provides support to the coexistence between the two perspectives postulated. Results indicate that advice relations between members of the same organizational subunits are shaped by hierarchical ordering. Advice is likely to be exchanged with status recognition, either socially or formally defined, and advice seeking relations are likely to be non mutual. When linking organizational members formally connected across subunits boundaries, advice relations are shaped by interpersonal trust. Advice is likely to be exchanged with advice, and advice seeking relations are likely to be mutual."
2016,"How Much To Copy When Building Routines? We revisit the classic question of how much to copy? from a routine formation perspective. While some argue that the organization will experience low performance unless all the parts of the target organizations routine is transferred, others argue that partial transfer results in more significant performance improvements. Employing the credit assignment model, we study the influence of the degree of knowledge transfer on the efficacy of routine formation. Our results show that the relationship between performance and the degree of knowledge transfer is positive in the short-run, but takes an inverted-U shape in the long-run. We further show that the effect of explorations and the net proportion of correct credit assignment are two important mechanisms that determine the reported patterns."
2016,"Institutional Field Building in Adverse Environments: Technology Entrepreneurship in Kenya We explore the puzzle of how new institutional fields are established in adverse environments. Locating our study in Nairobi, Kenya, where resource scarcity, cultural preferences for stability, and ambiguous formal institutions prevail, we find that innovation hubs fostered the new institutional field of technology entrepreneurship by structuring the field around resources, normative positioning, and ambiguity accommodation. We make contributions to research on institutional fields and field boundaries."
2016,"When innovations and institutions collide and collude to address social problems What happens when innovations meet institutions to address complex social problems? Mainstream management theorists have steadily been offering their insights to address this question by specifying the nature and texture of agency, the work that must be undertaken to shape and change institutions given complexities, and the performativity of institutions. This study adds to the conversation by examining the dynamics that unfold when innovations disrupt existing institutional settings to address disability. Specifically, we examine the responses of actors who are supposed to benefit from an innovation, which ranges from its acceptance to its outright rejection. We theorize why this is the case and explore implications for future research."
2016,"Global Repertoires of Entrepreneurial Action Using the case of Japanese bioscientists, this paper theorizes the effect of the transnational flow of ideas, people, and resources on the ways that global policies are practiced in places other than their country of origin. Drawing on in-depths interviews of Japanese university bioscientists, the study delineates how the scientists transnational experiences shaped complex ways they oriented towards and negotiated changes on the adoption of U.S. originated system of academic entrepreneurship. Before the changes, Japanese academia-industry interaction was largely managed by informal, gift- exchange like practices between individual university scientists and firms. Many scientists, on the other hand, had experiences with and ties to the U.S. system of entrepreneurship and collaboration long before the adoption of U.S. policies in Japan. As a result, Japanese scientists incorporated the global ideas and practices into their repertoire of practice without completely abandoning the informal Japanese methods of academic entrepreneurship. Instead, they tried to take advantages of having multiple sites of commercialization and multiple repertories of action, negotiating arrangements in Japan and simultaneously working in Japan and the U.S. Based on these findings, I posit that the forms of decoupling among global policy implementations result from negotiations between indigenous, global, and transnational knowledge and opportunity sets entertained by trans-local local actors."
2016,"Designing Organizational Boundaries for Open Innovation: A Rule-based Perspective Organizational boundaries play a key role in open innovation processes. Despite this relevance, we know little about the organizational grounds needed for interactions related to open innovation. I address this issue by arguing to design rules of organizational boundaries that practice open innovation. Drawing upon contingency theory and network innovation studies, I propose key dimensions of rules that regulate basic internal and external interactions related to open innovation. Highlighting crucial antecedents that result from the innovation strategy of a firm, I then develop archetypical approaches to design rules of organizational boundaries that practice open innovation. This conceptual paper at the intersection of organization studies and innovation studies provides new insights on the undertheorized issue of organizing for open innovation that are also highly relevant for management practice."
2016,"Venture Boards: The Impact of CVC-Directors on Venture Innovation Using hand-collected longitudinal data on venture boards, we examine their impact on new venture innovation in the medical device industry. Putting the spotlight on CVC-directors, we find a higher proportion of CVC directors on the venture board has a significant positive effect on ventures knowledge quality, but a significant negative effect on product introductions in the market. These effects are moderated by the proportion of inside directors, and other (i.e., non-CVC) outside directors who have either been CEOs or have had founding experience. While broadly consistent with the so-called sharks dilemma associated with CVC investment in new ventures, our study underscores the distinction between venture directors and venture investors."
2016,"Give me a hallelujah! Amen! Taming institutional complexity using emotions and domination We explore how the processes of invoking emotions and enacting domination are used by organizations as responses to deal with institutional complexity. These processes become particularly salient when organizational members, who are faced with a constellation of multiple logics, vary in their perceptions concerning the compatibility of those logics, as instantiated in organizational structures and practices. Through ethnographic research in eleven Pentecostal churches in urban Java, we find that institutional complexity summons not only rational, but also emotional responses from embedded actors, depending on the degree to which they perceive institutional logics to be incompatible. We theorize that the organizational repertoire of strategic responses to institutional complexity encompasses not only structural and practice-based adaptations, but also emotions-based responses. Leaders and followers in these churches use the latter as a third way of coping with difficult-to-reconcile tensions and contradictions, through processes we respectively label emotive domination and emotive self-regulation."
2016,"Does the Middle Conform or Compete? Risk and Audience Response as Scope for Mid-Status Conformity The middle-status conformity argument contends that actors in the middle of a status hierarchy fear falling below the standards of their audience and hence conform to prevailing norms. On the other hand, economic intuition would suggest that the middle of the pack experiences the fiercest competition and the strongest pressures to innovate and explore ways to escape the churn. This paper explores the tension between these two ideas, and proposes a general framework for understanding competition in hierarchies that embeds both predictions. Actors face an audience with standards that may be variously responsive to the actors choices. At the same time, actors must choose whether to take actions that expose them to favorable or unfavorable risks. Specific combinations of these general conditions can generate arbitrary patterns of exploration and conformity throughout a hierarchy, including both the inverse-U shape prediction of middle- status conformity as well as its opposite. A model formalizes these results and illustrates them in simulation."
2016,"The Efficacy of Formal Controls: Environmental Uncertainty as a Critical Contingency We investigate the efficacy of formal controls in the context of uncertain external environments. Specifically, we investigate the relationships among behavior control, outcome control, and environmental uncertainty, and their interactive effects on organizational performance. We anchor our theoretical arguments in control theory. We argue that in an uncertain environment where it is difficult to clearly specify and measure the process or the outcome, the combined use of behavior and outcome control at a high degree decreases performance. Empirical evidence is based on insights from 506 organizations across Australia, US, and China. We find that behavior control and outcome control exhibit complementary effect only when the level of environmental uncertainty is low. In so doing, our results enlighten the emerging complementary perspective of organizational control by adding environmental uncertainty as an important contingent variable in the efficacy of formal controls. However, by examining the level of these controls, and not just their existence, we show novel insights in uncertain environments. Our findings indicate that in highly uncertain environments, higher performance results from a high level of one formal control type (behavior or outcome) and a low level of the other  supporting the arguments for a proper balance of control types."
2016,"Bureaucratic Innovation and the Control of Labor In the Dutch East India Company, 1700-1796 While an ample literature has explored the trade-off between bureaucratic control and more entrepreneurial forms of organizing, existing research focuses on the performance of one organizational form over the other without addressing variation in how organizational members respond to these mechanisms within a firm. Our paper aims to address this gap. Drawing on the personnel records of more than half a million seafarers employed by the Dutch East India Company (VOC), we show how the company adopted a combination of bureaucracy and market-based inducements to reduce desertion rates. Although our findings reveal that this combination mitigated selected hazards associated with hierarchy and with entrepreneurial forms of organizing, the history of the VOC also highlights the tenuous nature of hybrid forms."
2016,"Substitutes or Complements? An Examination of Relational Governance and Management Controls Achieving the seemly stretch goals (high interfirm adaptation and low ex-post opportunism) enable superior interorganizational relationships outcome, however, simultaneously pursuing both of these objectives presents a considerable challenge. We link organizational control theory to relational embeddedness perspective and propose an integrated model for specifying the role of management controls (output, process, and social control mechanisms) and relational governance in reconciling conflicting interests in ex-post opportunism and interfirm adaptation. The findings indicate that the substitutive effects of relational governance and social control mechanisms can alleviate ex- post opportunism, while the complementary effect of relational governance and process control mechanisms can increase interfirm adaptation. Yet, the positive interaction effects between interaction between relational governance and process control mecanisms on interfirm adaptation will be mitigated while cultural differences exist."
2016,"Play and group creativity: An ethnography Based on a field study using ethnographic methods of observation and interview, we examine the role of play in creative work processes. Our notion of play incorporates activities that are enjoyable, undertaken voluntarily, and are not specifically related to the task at hand. While previous research has highlighted the effects of play on individual creativity, our findings shows that play has complex effects on group creative work processes on two distinct levels. Task-related effects include generating new ideas, enhanced helping behavior for colleagues creative endeavors, providing a safe context for difficult conversations, and engendering members heightened effort in collaborative work. Relationship-related effects include helping socialize newcomers, building organizational identification and across team relationships, and diffusing conflict. We also found individual effects of play, such as serving as a constant reminder of the need to be creative, providing incubation time for ideas, enhancing positive affect and motivation, and providing respite from intense work We draw on Huizingas theory of play to analyze and frame our findings, and extend this theory."
2016,"The invisible wand: Magic circles of play and work in a high-tech organization Based on an ethnographic study, we examine the way work is done in a play-intensive organization. We show playfulness to take the form of true play, i.e. volitional, intense, and non-work related. We also found playfulness to be spatially and temporally interlaced with work episodes. We identify both the mechanisms that enable people to move between the two types of activities, work and play, and the cues that trigger the transitions. We thus provide an explanation of the way work gets accomplished in a play-intensive organization."
2016,"Just Playing Around? The Effects of CEO Sense of Humor on Financial Analysts Executive personality is increasingly recognized as an important determinant of firm behaviors and outcomes. Despite the abundance of research on executive personality in the upper echelons, little is understood about the implications of an executives sense of humor. In this empirical paper, we draw on reversal theory, a theory of personality, and investigate how CEO sense of humor influences an important firm stakeholderfinancial analysts. We theorize that CEO sense of humor positively influences analyst coverage and analyst recommendations and also propose moderators of these relationships. Support is found for each of our four hypotheses, illustrating that CEO sense of humor is a relevant personality trait with important implications for firm outcomes."
2016,"The Gradual Fall to the Dark Side of the Force - A Process Perspective on Personalized Charisma We develop a process model to explain the emergence of personalized charismatic leadership. Drawing on theories of (leader) narcissism and previous charismatic leadership research, our model explains how and why leaders may gradually drift from socialized to personalized charisma: When the leaders initially moderate narcissistic self-views are reinforced by excessive perceptions of confirmation within close and distant relationships, these self-views get increasingly inflated. The more inflated narcissistic self-views get, the more likely is the emergence of destructive responses to critical feedback and perceptions of social rejection. Contextual factors with regard to the organizational context, follower characteristics, and additional sources of confirmation or rejection are considered. We offer research propositions, illustrate our model using reflections on the fictional character Anakin Skywalkers transition of gradually drifting to the dark side of the Force, and discuss implications of our model for future research and practitioners."
2016,"Reaching for the Stars Extant research has found that forming relationships with high- status colleagues provides a form of social capital that is crucial to enhancing ones productivity and career outcomes. We examine the role of third-party ties in facilitating such high- status connections, arguing that their effect differs for men and women. We focus our empirical analyses on the forty largest global pharmaceutical firms, a context in which there remains a significant gender gap despite womens equal human capital. We analyze tie formation dynamics among star (i.e., high-status) and non-star (i.e., low-status) R&D; scientists, using a patent- based, longitudinal dataset covering twenty-five years. Our results show that whereas the presence of common third-party ties increases the likelihood of tie formation between star and non- star scientists in general, women need third-party ties significantly more than men do. Our findings contribute to the growing literature on the differential effects of workplace networks on male and female employees, suggesting that womens path to social capital is more indirect than mens."
2016,"Free to Act? Brokerage, Autonomy, and Peer Evaluation In nearly every social and economic setting individuals evaluate one another. Evaluations are a necessary component for status attribution, rewards and penalties, and impact the social, economic, and psychological welfare of individuals. By implication, evaluation has considerable impact on organizational processes and outcomes. In this paper, we focus attention on the effectsof the evaluators social network on evaluation outcomes. We present results from a field intervention in which we implement a peer-to-peer based evaluation system in a business school setting. Our model includes both ascriptive and relational (e.g., friendship) characteristics of the evaluator- evaluated dyad, as well as the social structure within which the dyad is embedded. Using this fine-grained dataset we find strong evidence that connections matter, and that peers affect evaluation outcomes. Consistent with our predictions, individuals with broad networks rich in open triad counts receive more favorable evaluations. By contrast, evaluators with more open triad counts give more negative evaluations of their peers, suggesting that broad networks have opposing effects, contingent on an individuals role as evaluator or evaluated."
2016,"Perceived Affiliations through Spatial Positions and Status Dynamics in the U.S. Fashion Industry In this paper, we examine how spatial positions affect organizational status dynamics in the U.S. fashion industry. While prior studies focused on bilateral affiliations, we argue that the perception of affiliations by external audiences regardless of the intentions of the involved parties can also lead to status dynamics. In particular, we argue that, by creating perceived affiliations in the minds of the audiences, spatial positions in terms of premium locations and relative proximity to high-status organizations can improve the status of a focal firm. Furthermore, middle-status organizations benefit the most from these high-status spatial positions, because they are close to, but distant enough from the high-status position. In our empirical context of the U.S. fashion industry from 2001 to 2014, we find support for our theoretical arguments. Strategically placing an advertisement in a premium location or unexpectedly being featured near representative high-status fashion firms in a Vogue magazine has a positive impact on the average listed price of a focal companys fashion products, an important indicator of status positions among fashion companies. In addition, middle-status firms increase their listed prices most significantly through high-status spatial positions."
2016,"Endorsing or Eclipsing: Collaborator Status and the Consequences of Organizational Successes This paper seeks to address the long-standing theoretical puzzle of how the status of collaborators affects an organizations ability to reap gains from its successes. One perspective proposes that organizations benefit more from successes with higher-status collaborators because of their ability to confer influential endorsements, while an alternative Matthew effect perspective suggests that higher-status collaborators can diminish returns to success by eclipsing lower-status partners during credit attribution. Grounding our study in the venture capital (VC) industry, we advance a contingent perspective on the value of status signals by suggesting that the value of working with a high-status collaborator depends on the locus of potential backers concerns that vary systematically with the business cycle. Our findings suggest that organizations benefit more from successful collaborations with higher status actors during cold market periods when prospective backers are worried primarily about the downside risks; conversely organizations benefit more from successful collaborations with lower status actors during hot periods when their investors are fixated on the potential upsides. The implications for our understanding of the benefits and drawbacks of high-status affiliations are discussed."
2016,"Beyond Interfirm Dissimilarity: The Impact of Status Difference on Unplanned Alliance Dissolution Alliances are a crucial approach to achieve firms strategic goals, but many alliances end prematurely. A well-received perspective is that these unsatisfactory outcomes might be driven by the dissimilarity between firms in alliances. This study posits that interfirm dissimilarities are not always harmful for alliances and that some interfirm difference could be beneficial. Specifically, we argue that status difference, or the disparity between two firms statuses, could facilitate interfirm interactions while stabilizing alliance operations. Building on this baseline hypothesis, we also consider the conditions under which the effect of status difference would be moderated, including alliance exploration and alliance complexity. Analyses based on a multi-year sample of joint ventures in the U.S. computer industry suggest that status difference reduces the likelihood of unplanned alliance dissolutions. Moreover, although the impact of status difference was found to be stronger in exploration alliances, alliance complexity did not alter the impact of status difference."
2016,"Cultural Scaffolding: Resources, Rhetoric, and Materiality in Cultural Entrepreneurship In this paper, I examine the utility of cultural entrepreneurship for organizational incumbents. I use a multiple case study of six hotels in the luxury sector that engaged in efforts to transform the meanings ascribed to them, so as to resonate with their guests and other audiences. I reveal that the hotels acted as cultural entrepreneurs in adapting as socio- cultural meanings associated with luxury changed. Surprisingly, rather than conveying a singularly cohesive or uniformly robust set of meanings, the hotels used culture as an interpretive touchstone composed of rhetorical language and physical materiality, which I metaphorically term cultural scaffolding. Using this cultural scaffolding, they not only relayed the meanings they sought to claim, but also allowed their guests to use these as a baseline to create their own meanings about what luxury meant, in the context of their hotel experience. My findings advance scholarly understanding of cultural entrepreneurship by establishing its utility for, and use by, incumbent organizations, and more broadly suggest that, in transforming meanings associated with them, organizations may counter-intuitively be most successful when they hold culture lightly."
2016,"Legitimacy Spillovers and Piggybacking: The Collective Legitimation of New Ventures and Fields All new ventures face the liability of newness, and even more so in nascent entrepreneurial fields. This pressure is attenuated by the acquisition of legitimacy, which is consistently highlighted as beneficial in the literature. Yet, little attention has been given to the downsides of acquiring legitimacy or the benefits of failing to do so. Conceptualizing entrepreneurship as a distributed and collective process, this paper examines how prior successes and failures shape future legitimation efforts. We first argue that legitimation efforts are contingent on the ability of entrepreneurs to attract new audiences. Considering both successes and failures, we distinguish legitimation efforts that generate legitimacy spillovers from those that do not and argue that these spillovers enable entrepreneurs to piggyback off the legitimation efforts of others. We test our hypotheses by examining more than 180,000 crowdfunding campaigns launched on Kickstarter, one of the most important crowdfunding platforms. In doing so, our work contributes to cultural and constitutive perspectives on entrepreneurship."
2016,"Thats Not What Happened! Sustaining Expectations Through Collective Storytelling. From a cultural perspective, narratives are understood as the main mechanism through which actors legitimate novel ideas, practices or forms of organizing. On the one hand, narratives serve as a touchstone by which audiences confer legitimacy. On the other, narratives also set expectations, which in turn set the stage for future disappointments. Answering a call for a better understanding of how narratives are revised in order to maintain or regain legitimacy, I followed the journey of Double Fine  a small independent video game studio  over three turbulent years, from their launch of one of the very first highly successful crowdfunding campaigns to the delivery of the final product. From this longitudinal and qualitative case study, I develop a model of collective storytelling to explicate how expectations were sustained over time. In so doing, this paper explores the active role that audiences play in conferring and maintaining legitimacy, which had previously been undertheorized."
2016,"Crossing the threshold & exiting nascency: Antecedents to gaining full-fledged legitimacy New entrepreneurs experience the liability of newness in the nascent stage of their competitive activity. In many industries, the exit from this stage takes place through an explicit decision of a core mediator that allows the new entrepreneur to enter the market as a fully legitimate competitor. The construction of full legitimacy denoted by the decision of the core mediator, can itself be affected by signals about the entrepreneur while still in the nascent stage. In the setting of the contemporary visual arts, we use a unique longitudinal data set to analyze third party signals as predictors of the first affiliation with an art gallery, who in this empirical context is the core mediator. We find that signal diversity and evaluator credibility are strong determinants of the core mediators decision to allow the new competitor to cross the legitimacy threshold and exit the nascent stage."
2016,"Small family wineries, their business models, and socioemotional wealth Family businesses are the dominant form of business in the world and are considered to have unique characteristics from other forms of business, yet their business models receive limited examination in the literature. This qualitative exploratory research used in-depth interviews to identify what owners and managers of small family wine companies understand to be the characteristics of the business models of their businesses, or the ways in which the businesses created and captured value. This research found that the business model characteristics of small family wine business are centred on nonfinancial characteristics aligned with the concept of socioemotional wealth rather than the traditional financial characteristics associated with business models, that is, those aligned with material success, profitability and/or economic value. The findings of this qualitative research stress the importance of nonfinancial characteristics of family business models, and suggest that a failure to consider them along with the traditional financial characteristics may see this economically significant and unique form of organisation being undervalued."
2016,"Governance units and field evolution dynamics: The case of UK management consulting This paper seeks to develop Fligstein and McAdams theory of strategic action fields (2011; 2012). This perspective relates field development patterns to the interactions between different typologies of actors: incumbents, challengers and internal governance units (IGUS). In this paper we focus on the role, behavior and changing strategies of internal governance units (IGUS) which are an essential component in field level settlements but have been largely under-researched. Based on a 60-year study of the development of the UK management consulting field, we examine the changing relationship patterns between various types of internal governance units and different waves of challengers and incumbents. In particular, we show how IGUS are not limited to a passive and conservative role as posited by Fligstein and McAdam (2012) but are capable of pursuing more independent courses of action. Based on our exploratory study, we seek to better theorize these complex behaviours of IGUS, their relations with other field members and their role in field evolution dynamics."
2016,"Informational Salience and the Adoption of Microfinance How does the introduction of information in the social structures of different markets affect individual behavior and collective outcomes? This study exploits the random seeding of information about microfinance with respect to the social structures of 43 independent, self-organized money markets in India to examine differences in an eligible borrower's receptivity to adopting the program over time conditional on receiving information about the program from an informed peer. A network quasi-experiment enables analytic decomposition of the effects into (i) endogenous peer effects, (ii) exogenous peer effects, and (iii) effects related to the salience of information. The article finds that the salience of information about the program decreased an eligible borrower's probability of adopting the program and also decreased the aggregate adoption rate over time. These findings suggest that informational salience is an important determinant of individual behavior and collective outcomes in markets."
2016,"Scaling up Socially-Oriented Markets:Tipping Point Dynamics in Coupled Supply and Demand Diffusion Complex societal challenges, from poverty alleviation to healthy food consumption to ecosystem preservation, have progressively emerged from early and still persisting- modes of industrialization and consumption that have evolved without consideration for the long-term adverse consequences for either or both the health of the people and that of the planet. Reaching sufficient scale of impact requires to place these considerations upfront as a driver of innovation, profitability and growth in mainstream commercial markets. However, creating such new markets that transform existing social, economic and institutional arrangements is a complex process. In this process numerous practices, ideas and innovations are to be adopted by multiple stakeholders within and across both supply and demand sides of the market, with this coupled adoption posing great challenges. We develop a dynamic computational model that builds on and advances well-known diffusion models. Coupling two sets of stakeholders i.e. these driving supply and demand in the model, we explore the tipping points in widespread adoption of practices based on contextual factors and successful market creation. Besides, we study how diffusion of practices on each side of the market and interactions between two sides facilitate or hinder creation of a new market. Insights from the model enable us to better understand the complexities in creating new markets that need parallel and interconnected adoption of particular practices, and provide policy insights for market-centered interventions."
2016,"Learning Not to Diversify: The Co-evolution of Business Education and Corporate Diversification The decline and fall of diversification as legitimate corporate strategy occurred slowly in the United States. We argue that changes that occurred in a closely related fieldgraduate business educationwere important in understanding the slow pace of de-diversification. Changes in the contents of graduate business educationmore specifically, the rise of agency-theoretic logic in the MBA curriculum in U.S. business schools in the 1970saltered the students view about corporations and diversification strategy. Nearly twenty years later, these MBA graduates rose to the top decision-making positions and de-diversified American corporations. Using the data from U.S. CEOs, we show that CEOs who earned an MBA degree before the emergence of the agency logic actively engaged in diversifying acquisitions, whereas the next generation of CEOs who absorbed the agency logic abandoned diversification strategy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the CEOs who earned an MBA after the rise of the agency logic were receptive to both internal and external monitoring, reflecting their acceptance of the agency-theoretic financial orthodoxy. Our study therefore demonstrates that the institutional change in one field (i.e., business education) contributed to changes in another field (i.e., corporate diversification), albeit with a considerable time lag."
2016,"How Specialists Maintain Authentic Market Identities Following the Adoption of New Technology  Why do organizations that adopt new technologies later in time eventually make the decision to do so? Diffusion scholars identify performance enhancement and legitimacy as two contrasting motives for late adopters. However, few studies take into account the importance of organizational identities, which complicate the relationship between performance and legitimacy. Using qualitative interview data with staff of niche movie theaters, this paper examines organizations for whose identities older technological practices are important, identifying processes behind organizations decisions to adopt newer technologies and subsequent organizational strategies for bolstering legitimacy among audience members. While resource dependence best explained adoption decisions, most organizations compromised by maintaining both older and newer technologies. Organizations used strategies I identify as information and innovation in order to bolster legitimate identities among audience members. Further studies should examine the relationship between organizational identity and diffusion among a variety of organizations."
2016,"Coming Back & Giving Back: Returnee Directors and Corporate Donations Literature on institutional change has studied such drivers for change as distributional conflicts, exogenous shocks, and external influences exerted by governments and firms. In this paper, we explore the role of mobile individuals as carriers and transmitters of initial impetus for change. We argue that these individuals return ingrained with new ideas from the outside and are sufficiently embedded in the original context to make change happen from the inside. We focus on one such type of individual, returnees, i.e., expatriates who have gained their education or early-career work experience abroad, who then return to their home countries, and we examine the thesis that returnees transmit the idea of corporate social responsibility (CSR) from abroad and then spark change at home. Using data on publicly listed Chinese companies from 2000 to 2012, and exploiting the introduction of provincial policies toward attracting returnees as an instrumental variable for firms returnee levels, we find that having returnees on the corporate board significantly boosts firms donations. This effect is robust to a battery of robustness tests. We further show that returnee directors donate more, not in pursuit of tax benefits or political access, but as a result of their imprinted state-of-mind on the institutional idea of CSR. We discuss implications for the literature on institutional change, return migration, and corporate social responsibility."
2016,"Living in the Triplet World: The Market, Family, and State Logics and Corporate Philanthropy The institutional logic perspective recognizes the coexistence of multiple institutional logics, each of which sustains its own form of rationality. Research in this adolescent field has mainly focused on how multiple logics affect organizations simultaneously. Yet, the mutual constitution and interactions among logics are far less explored. This paper develops and tests a theory of the coexistence of multiple logics in corporate philanthropy using data from private firms in China. Beyond the burgeoning market logic underlying corporate philanthropy, this study suggests that two non-market logicsthe family and state logic exert their effects on corporate philanthropy through cultural and political mechanisms. Moreover, both the state and family logic buffer the effects of the market logic on corporate philanthropy, suggesting the interactions and competitions among institutional logics in guiding organizational practices."
2016,"Strategic Ambiguity in Situations of Enduring Institutional Complexity Existing literature suggests that organizations reduce institutional complexity by ridding themselves of competing demands or by creating new hybrid identities that integrate competing elements. However, some organizations reside in environments of enduring institutional complexity where competing elements cannot be dismissed or perfectly integrated. I use corporate philanthropy as a case study of enduring institutional complexity, as corporate grantmakers who oversee corporate foundations must navigate both the business and nonprofit fields. They cannot reduce complexity by eliminating competing elements, nor can they perfectly integrate elements. Drawing from 30 interviews with corporate grantmakers as well as participant observation of corporate foundations, I argue that the successful navigation of enduring institutional complexity is achieved through the mechanism of ambiguity. Infusing ambiguity into the process of corporate philanthropy  including via ambiguous goals, ambiguous definitions of success, and imprecise outcome metrics  fosters multiple interpretations and strengthens the ability to appease various audiences. Ambiguity allows actors to project fit with multiple audiences and address competing dimensions without engaging in costly negotiations. I argue that ambiguity is most successful as a response to enduring complexity when complete hybdrization of competing elements is not the primary goal. In the case of corporate philanthropy, ambiguity leads corporate grantmakers to rely heavily on other signals of legitimacy as they make funding decisions, namely nonprofit reputation and corporate norms."
2016,"Morals and Product Categories: The Development of Socially Responsible Investment Funds While many studies explain how product categories organize markets and facilitate exchanges between producers and clients by providing actors with cognitive tools that act as disciplinary devices, few reflect on how such categories might be inappropriate when their aim is to identify which products are socially desirable. Drawing on a new conception of product categories as questioning and moralizing devices, we examine the consequences of posing goals at the root of the definition of a product category. Elaborating on a nine-year field study of the development of Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) funds in the French asset management industry, we show how product categories that are usually perceived as neutral features are actually fundamentally morally polarized. By illuminating the intermingled nature of markets, we suggest that future management research should aim to tackle how product categories can help address societal concerns and thereby promote an inclusive approach to market exchange."
2016,"The Rise of Socially Responsible Investing Funds: The Paradoxical Role of Finance  	Socially responsible investing (SRI) is gaining relevance in the financial sector, and the number of SRI funds is steadily increasing, but how the institutions of finance affect the founding of these funds is not well understood. This study addresses this shortcoming by combining the institutional logics and financialization literatures. Our theory suggests a paradoxical role of the financial logic that explains an intriguing empirical finding: the founding rate of SRI funds has a curvilinear, concave down relationship with the prevalence of a financial logic in society. Furthermore, this relationship is moderated by broader societal arrangements, such as labor relations and financial systems. This study concludes by discussing its contributions to research on institutional theory, financialization and socially responsible investing."
2016,"Multiplex Ties and Knowledge Sharing: Effects of Tie Formation Order Prior research shows multiplex ties to be consequential for many outcomes. The potential path dependencies of multiplex tie formation, and their effects on these outcomes, have not yet been examined. Original qualitative research suggests that the order of tie formation may influence the type of trust dominating a multiplex tie. Categorizing workplace ties as either instrumental or expressive, multiplex ties originating as instrumental ties (i.e., I-E ties) are likely to be dominated by cognition-based trust, and multiplex ties originating as expressive ties (i.e., E-I ties) by affect-based trust. Given the known effects of trust on knowledge sharing, we examine whether multiplex ties can have different knowledge sharing consequences, depending on the initial tie type. We test for distinctive effects of I-E versus E-I ties on knowledge seeking and giving using an online vignette study. Although we find no differences between I-E versus E-I multiplex ties, we do find significant differences in the importance of multiplex ties on knowledge sharing. Multiplex ties yield higher likelihoods of knowledge giving than instrumental or expressive ties alone. Surprisingly, only the presence of an instrumental tie  independent from the presence or absence of other ties  yields higher probabilities of knowledge seeking."
2016,"Patterned Fluidity of Chinese Ethnic Identity: Networks, Time, and Place Based on the survey data of Chinese graduate students in two universities in the U.S., I investigate the Chinese ethnic identity. With combined insight of identity theory and social identity theory, I analyze the impact of social networks, time, and place on salience/prominence of Chinese ethnic identity. The study shows that the immediate social environment of ego network  people revolving a focal person - provides the arena for individuals to form understanding of ethnic in-group and out-group contrast. However, ego network is not immune to the larger social context with various ethnic compositions in population and different degrees of culture diversity. A cosmopolitan socio-cultural environment with high degree of diversity in terms of race/ethnicity and culture is conducive to the maintenance of ethnic identity when an individual has many co-nationals in his/her ego network. On the other hand, having many co-nationals in ones ego network does not stop the decline of ethnic salience/prominence in an isolated social environment. Also, as an ethnic group who are recent arrivals in the U.S. from a highly homogeneous social context in mainland China, the heightened sense of ethnic identity formed at arrival in the U.S. lapses with time as the respondents become more familiar with the social environment in the U.S. unless they keep a cohort of co-nationals. Ethnic identity seems to require a balance between host culture and home culture in an individuals network to maintain."
2016,"IJVs CEOs as Boundary Spanners and Inter-Organization Cooperation Integrating boundary spanning and organizational identification theories, we posit that a boundary spanners organizational identification (i.e., the sense of oneness with an organization) is an important factor shaping inter-organizational relationships. We examined CEOs of international joint ventures (IJVs) as the boundary spanners. We found that organizational identification of an IJVs CEO with a parent firm is positively related to cooperation between the venture and that parent, and this relationship is stronger when the level of goal incongruence between parents is higher. The cooperation between the foreign (but not local) parent and the IJV is in turn positively related to the IJVs performance. This study extends extant research by revealing the role of a boundary spanners organizational identification in inter-organizational boundary spanning as well as inter-firm goal incongruence as a boundary condition for this role."
2016,"Self-Regulation in Collaborative Environments: The Case of the Equator Principles in Banking Using banks in the syndicated lending market as an example, we discuss a firm- specific strategy that has been overlooked by the literature, namely, that self- regulated firms pressure other non-self-regulated firms in an attempt to reduce effort asymmetries when collaborating. We develop a framework that shows when such a strategy is likely to be present. This framework is built on the view that the costs and benefits of collaboration are equally shared among self- regulated firms that collaborate. However, when self-regulated firms collaborate with non-self-regulated firms, the effort they exert differs and is not equally shared. In particular, we find that when firms collaborate, self- regulating firms pressure non-self-regulated firms to become self-regulated with the purpose of reducing effort asymmetries, and such pressure increases with the duration of collaboration."
2016,"Signalling Legitimacy and Shaping Ethics: Impact of Nonprofit Interlocks on Corporate Misconduct The notion that it takes a village is a concept that is not foreign and has been examined in many studies on social capital. Nonetheless, extant work on the antecedents of organizational misconduct tends to focus on individual and organizational characteristics that drive such behavior while neglecting the impact of relationships. In fact, corporations do not exist in a vacuum and interact with a wide variety of organizations with different goals and institutional logics. This paper contributes to studies on organizational misconduct by exploring how interlocks between Fortune 500 corporations and nonprofit organizations affect the incidence of earning restatements. Findings include the notion that firms more embedded with nonprofits are more likely to restate their earnings, especially when these nonprofits are pro-social and donative."
2016,"How do conflicting logics lead to decoupled activities? Evidence from rural Ghana In this paper we explore the links between the notions of decoupling in Institutional Theory (IT) and of activity systems of Activity Theory (AT), by considering the case of delivery of agricultural extension services in rural Ghana. We study the network of linked activities for agricultural extension service provision; at the level of policymaking, district management and at the field level. Our mixed-method research approach includes extensive qualitative (observation and interviews), as well as quantitative (spatial mobility data) fieldwork at three districts. Findings concerning service delivery at the different operational levels, are heavily scaffolded by means of AT; while IT informs our answer to the research question, how do conflicting, market- and help-based, institutional logics in the rural environment shape the activities of agricultural extension service delivery?. The empirical contributions of this work include explanations of the emergence of institutional decoupling between policy and practice, and means and end. The theoretical contribution of this work involves the synthesis of AT and IT, into an approach for the generation of meaningful insights. A further contribution is the use of a mixed-methods research strategy."
2016,"Examining attributes and salience in not-for-profit and for-profit stakeholders Although Mitchell et al. (1997) recognize salience attributes as variables, the salience framework based on a dichotomous representation of salience attributes does not explain why a latent stakeholder is assigned more salience than a definitive stakeholder. We explain this riddle by bringing the debate to the organizational population level. We compare two organizational populationsi.e., for-profit and not-for-profitwhich are distinguishable from one another based on the dominant institutional logic that each endorses. We propose that 1) members of an organizational population endorsing similar institutional logic develop salience attributes of similar potential values, which are radically different from those of the members of other organizational populations; 2) these potential values act as precursors that determine the perceived values of salience attributes for a manager; 3) dominant and recessive salience attributes mutely work, at the organizational population level, to determine stakeholder prioritization."
2016,"Exploring the Process of Institutional Isomorphism in Patchy Organizational Fields Institutional isomorphism is a useful framework for understanding how organizations respond to their environments; however, there are gaps in our knowledge of how the process of isomorphism works. The micro-dynamics of isomorphic processes remain relatively unexplored, and there are also challenges to our assumptions about the composition of organizational fields, and about the roles and affiliations of field members. We address some of these gaps by analyzing the example of the Education Quality Assurance (EQA) designation, which is given to post-secondary institutions by the British Columbia provincial government. This example provides a rich site for investigation of isomorphic processes because it is located in a patchy organizational field with loose boundaries and a diverse membership. Our analysis indicates several possible new directions for research on institutional isomorphism, such as greater attention to governments power as a legitimator, the importance of agency and choice in the process of organizations adoption of symbols of legitimacy, the evaluation of legitimacy indicators by members of an organizational field, and the potential value of the concept of patchy organizational fields in gaining a more accurate understanding of the dynamics of institutional isomorphism."
2016,"Flexibility Stigma: Its About Time! This paper explores workplace flexibility and the development of flexibility stigma by proposing potential antecedents to flexibility stigma. Flexibility stigma is considered as a cultural schema arising at the work unit level and thus predicted by demographic, structural, managerial, and task-relevant characteristics within a given work unit. By adopting a temporal lens on workplace culture, workplace norms around time use and their potential violations are suggested as a mechanism leading to a cultural schema of flexibility stigma. Further, drawing on institutional theory, flexibility stigma is proposed as a mediating mechanism to explain when organizations, and in this case work-units, might have official policies that are decoupled from realized practices. Proposed methodology and future directions for research are discussed."
2016,"Organizational Identity Categories in a Labor Market Research in organizational ecology of product and investment markets finds that socially constructed understandings of organizational identities constrain organizational behavior, and widespread conformity on the part of organizations to audience expectations in turn leads to the replication of identity categories. These effects illustrate what is known as the duality of niche and form: niches define forms and forms define niches (Hannan and Freeman, 1986). We predict that this duality also holds in labor markets. Using card sorting techniques in in-depth interviews, we find considerable consensus on organizational identity categories among participants in the Turkish banking labor market. We show that these labor market identity categories correspond to niches that banks occupy in resource space and to sets of structural equivalence in a network of employee mobility. Moreover, identity categories shape labor market participants preferences for firms. Distinctiveness of identity categories accentuates the appeal of firms to workers employed by firms in the same identity category."
2016,"Producers and Their Products: Genre Ambiguity in the U.S. Publishing Industry, 1999-2013 While prior work has generally focused on consequences of categorical ambiguity, very little is known about its antecedents. We address this limitation by examining whether and how a products categorical ambiguity is shaped by its producers as well as the product itself. We predict that the past categorical ambiguity of producers will increase the current categorical ambiguity of their products. As multiple producers often engage in the production process, audiences category perceptions are likely to vary according to different producers. Thus we examine whether the categorical ambiguity of a product is (1) independently affected by each producer and (2) jointly affected by multiple producers. Using the U.S. publishing industry as an empirical context, we show that the perceived genre ambiguity of a book is positively influenced by the genre ambiguity of its authors previous writings and its publishers previous publications. We also find that the positive main effects are amplified when both the author and the publisher have greater levels of genre ambiguity. The study has implications for recent research on classification, category dynamics, and identity."
2016,"A Study of Firm Exit Decisions: The Interplay of Private and Social Signals This study examines how organizations' private information obtained from performance feedback is moderated by social learning mechanisms. Building on inferential learning and market categorization literatures, my theory suggests that even when organizations experience multiple performance failures, they are not likely to exit the market when a substantial number of peers have entered the industry. On the contrary, they are more likely to exit the market when a relatively large number of peers have exited. The latter relationship is weakened when the average number of industries with which exiting peers engage is greater. This is because decision makers regard the exits of those who are involved in diverse categories as involuntary actions rather than signaling a negative market situation, and they rely less on such signals. I test my theory using longitudinal data on the exit decisions of 1,405 U.S. private venture capital firms from 1987 to 2014."
2016,"Drawing Lines in the Sand: Organizational Responses to Evaluations in a Swedish University As organizations are increasingly evaluated, evaluative practices are becoming central to organization theory. While highlighting the reactive nature of organizational response to evaluation, earlier work on organizations and evaluation has been limited to inter-organizational evaluations. In this paper we theorize and explore intra-organizational evaluations, in our case a research evaluation exercise at a major Swedish university. In contrast to inter- organizational evaluations, intra-organizational evaluations rely on internally defined evaluative entities. This means that apart from reacting by changing activities, organizations can also respond to evaluations by re-configuring the evaluative entities. We explore empirically how this takes place, and we draw conclusions for what this means for theories of organizational evaluation. We thus extend theories of organizational evaluation and suggest fundamental new questions about organizational evaluation."
2016,"Competitive Dynamics of Incumbents and Challengers in British Electoral Competition, 1955- 2005 Recent studies have pointed to the close interrelationship between identity and competition. Missing from this literature is the question of whether and how prior identity engagements of organizations in specific competitive domains shape further competitive action? We contend that identity engagement of organizations in competitive domains act not only as lenses that magnify identity strength, but also as signals that indicate identity weakness. In the case of incumbent organizations, we argue that domain identity engagements in earlier time period will act as lenses that magnify their identity strength and will prompt such organizations to make more claims on domain elements that are part of their identity. On the other hand, in the case of challenger organizations, their domain identity engagements in earlier time period would act as signals that indicate identity weakness to competitors and consequently will invite more claims of competitors on domain elements that are part of their identity. We find empirical evidence for these arguments from British electoral competition during the period, 1955- 2005."
2016,"Feature-based vs Goal-based Categories: The Effects of Spanning in Both Systems Simultaneously Previous research suggested that category spanning causes products to receive lower evaluations by audiences. We question this notion and propose that the effects of category spanning depend on the category system in which spanning occurs: in a system where memberships are determined by shared features, spanning can engender ambiguity and decrease products appeal; however, in a system where memberships are based on audiences goals, spanning can imply versatility and lead to better evaluations. Furthermore, we argue that these effects are different if products concurrently span categories in both systems. Our analysis of audiences evaluations of products in the commercial music industry supports these hypotheses: spanning categories in a goal-based system has a U-shaped effect, and whereas products with focused features benefit from having more goal-based memberships, products with heterogeneous features benefit from having fewer. The implications of these findings for the organizational literature are discussed."
2016,"How should I act? Reflexive praxis in hybrid organizing The exclusion of certain segments of society from the economic system is of growing concern. For Indigenous communities, such exclusion has been especially pernicious duein partto conflict between the inherent self-interest underpinning a capitalistic market logic and the values of sharing, cooperation and strong personal ties underpinning a community logic. Hybrid organizations offer one mechanism for combining these competing institutional logics, and promoting the inclusion of Indigenous peoples in the mainstream economy. However, our understanding of how individuals working in these organizations navigate the tensions and develop hybridizing practices remains limited. We conduct comparative case studies of two hybrid organizations operating in Australia and Canada. We propose a model of reflexive praxis, defined as the process by which people, both as individuals and collectively, questioned their understanding of self and other in ways that orient them to action, thus leading to the enactment of hybridizing organizational practices. Reflexive praxis builds on reflexive awareness and reflexive action at both individual and collective levels. We discuss implications of our theory development for the fields of reflexivity, hybrid organizing, and the inclusion of Indigenous peoples."
2016,"Category Uncertainty and Contingent Preferences for Generalists and Specialists Work by economic sociologists who study the effects of categorization systems on market outcomes has led to a prominent inconsistency. Early extant evidence suggests that social actors who incorporate characteristics from multiple categories, thereby spanning them, are evaluated poorly relative to their more focused peers. However, other work has reached the opposite conclusion by demonstrating that category spanning result in advantages. We attempt to reconcile this contradiction by suggesting that rewards to generalism and specialism are contingent on the goals of the evaluators. Specifically, we suggest that evaluators differ in the uncertainty that they are attempting to resolve when making market decision. We portray a model of decision making that details how a buyers needs can span a across categories. We conceptualize this as categorical slots to be filled. We hypothesize that increasing uncertainty a buyer is seeking will lead to a greater breadth of these categorical slots to be filled than buyers who have less categorical uncertainty regarding what they seek. Those buyers who exhibit greater breadth in the categorical slots they seek to fill are more likely to prefer generalists than those consumers who exhibit high certainty and seek a single category slot. This is because generalists address a broader range of these needs. Predictions are supported with vignette studies on MTURK where subjects were asked to choose among generalist and specialist restaurants to bring visitors either from a single country (low uncertainty condition) or from a variety of countries (high uncertainty condition)."
2016,"From Whence the Hybrid Organization?: Welfare and Professionalism in a Childrens Hospital There is growing interest in hybrid organizations, or organizations that combine elements from distinct institutional logics. Recently, scholars have begun to unpack how hybrid organizations successfully manage the contradictions that arise from internalizing competing logics. However, less is known about how changes in societal-level institutional logics influence the how organizations manage hybridity. Using data that spans 47 years, this paper explores how a childrens hospital responds, evolves, and manages hybridity, as societal logics change. Importantly, we find that managing organizational hybridity is easier when societal-level logics embrace combination; when such combinations are not embraced at a societal-level, managing organizational hybridity becomes much more difficult."
2016,"Engagement and Mutual Influence of Multiple Audiences and the Performance of Boundary Spanners Recent research on market categories revealed that while most audiences penalize producers that span multiple market categories by withdrawal of resources and attention, few audiences react to boundary spanners in more positive ways. It remains unknown, however, whether different audiences affect each others judgments and, if they do, what the consequences of this mutual influence for boundary spanners are. We develop a theory explaining how three different types of audiences, namely, investors, consumers and critics, react to an extraordinary past success of a boundary spanning producer. We argue that these three audiences rely on different evaluation criteria to assess the producers success. When different audiences disagree in their evaluation of the boundary spanner, they tend to ignore each others judgments when deciding how to interact with this producer. However, when different audiences agree that the boundary spanner achieved an extraordinary success, all three different audiences tend to ignore boundary spanning and reward this producer. We find support for our theory in the probit analysis of the population of all co- productions of TV shows created for the primetime on networks in the U.S., 1947- 2003."
2016,"Corporate Collectivism in the Alcohol Industry and the Emergence of Issue-Based Industry Collectiv We build on an exploratory study of the global emergence of industry collectives around the issue of alcohol-related harm to understand how central actors may attempt to maintain their positions in the face of legitimacy threats. In particular, we focus on the evolution of the issue-based field of alcohol-related harm in the Netherlands, Denmark and the UK in order to (a) describe the unique features of issue-based industry collectives (IBICs) and (b) examine the factors that contributed to their emergence and proliferation. We find that one important characteristic of IBICs is that they span categories. We theorize that such collective category spanning is more likely to occur when (i) there is a stable power balance between categories, (ii) there are pre-existing ties across categories, and (iii) there is a credible regulatory threat. These findings contribute to our understanding of institutional maintenance and corporate collectivism. Our study also enhances the literature on corporate collectivism by investigating a new domain and by providing evidence for what factors shape the emergence of issue- based industry collectives."
2016,"The Tragedy of the Anticommons: The Partial Institutionalization of a Commons Logic A burgeoning literature on institutional logics has shown how these enduring cultural symbols and material practices play a critical role in the initiation, development, and maintenance of fields. However, fewer micro-processual studies account for the emergence of new logics. To investigate the bottom-up process leading to the development of a logic, we selected open-access academic publication and studied attempts to turn the prevailing logic of closed-access publications into an open-access logic in which knowledge is a commons (i.e., a shared resource available to all). Drawing on data from a variety of sources over a thirty-year period, we observed that while disgruntled academics tried to substitute expensive subscriptions with freely accessible journals, they met strong opposition from commercial publishers who saw open access as a threat to their revenue generation model. Different mechanisms used by challengers to develop and amplify an open access logic interacted with those wielded by incumbents to hamper the development of such a logic. The outcome is a truncated logic in field where the knowledge commons of open access publications has become only partially institutionalized."
2016,"Seeing the World Anew: Merleau-Ponty and the Creation of Sense in Sensemaking In this paper, we theorize how the creation of sense happens in sensemaking. We note that this aspect of sensemaking concerned with the earliest moments when raw experience becomes structured into a provisional frame or perspective remains poorly understood. Drawing on the phenomenology of Merleau-Ponty, we suggest that sense is created by perception, bypassing the mediation of cognition. Contrary to the accepted view that sense is created through cognitive connections between cues and frames, we show how embodied perception makes situations meaningful spontaneously, pre-reflectively, holistically, and non-deliberately, such that sense is created on the go and acted out in an embodied way. We illustrate our argument by revisiting the selected sensemaking studies and discuss the implications of bringing perception in for studying sensemaking as embodied, immanent, and creative of new realities, both individual and collective."
2016,"The network dynamics of attention in organizations: Mechanisms, models and empirical results We propose a mechanism-based theory of attention that explains how the structure of organizational attention networks emerges from time ordered sequences of interdependent acts of attention allocation. The theory posits that the observable structure of attention networks is produced and reproduced by four endogenous micro-relational mechanisms regulating how organizational participants allocate their attention to problems: attention focusing; attention reinforcing; attention mixing, and attention clustering. We propose a model where these mechanisms concatenate to give rise to a fluid attention network that changes in continuous time as participants join and leave the organizational arena, and problems emerge, disappear, and reappear. Our analysis of attention allocation in a large open source software project finds evidence that the mechanisms postulated by the theory are consistent with the evolutionary dynamics of the of the attention network actually observed throughout the complete life history of the project. Accounting for individual characteristics of problems, individual differences among participants, and for the formal organizational structure of the project does not affect the core results of the analysis. The study contributes to a new theoretical understanding of organizing as a process structured by temporal, rather than intentional, or consequential mechanisms connecting problems to carriers of potential solutions."
2016,"Always in a fight: the institutional work of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Recent efforts have highlighted the work that organizations perform to create or maintain their institution. Under the broad term of institutional work, scholars have examined efforts by individuals and organizations to create institutions, maintain institutions, and defend institutions from attacks. This work however, has tended to compartmentalize the work of creation from the work of maintenance. In this paper, we examine the life course of an organization to view how they move from creation to maintenance. Our historical study of the National Collegiate Athletic Association demonstrates that organizations once founded and institutionalized constantly face challenges. Sometimes organizations respond by ignoring these challenges, sometimes they defend by doing maintenance work, but sometimes they also respond by making major changes to their own institutions. This suggests that instead of thinking of institutional creation work as separately from maintenance work, the scholars would benefit by following the conflict and problematizing how organizations resolve conflicts. Our work also is a call for more studies that examine the entire life-course of an institution as opposed to focusing only small time windows."
2016,"Myopic Reactions to Performance Feedback: Different Decision Makers, Different Decisions The behavioral theory of the firm predicts that problemistic search and organizational change occurs after performance below the aspiration level, and this prediction has been strongly supported. The bounded rationality assumption in the behavioral theory of the firm suggests that such search is often myopic. However, we still lack theory explaining how myopia influences decision makers choosing search directions when performance feedback indicates a problem. In this study, we address the question of search direction. We develop theory on how decision maker cognitions formed by their past experiences underlie coalitions that direct myopic search, leading to connections between the decision making group composition and the likelihood of different types of organizational changes. We apply the theory to a well-known reaction to performance feedbackmergers and acquisitions and show that the composition of the key decision making groupboard of directorsworks with performance feedback to affect the type of merger as an outcome of myopic search."
2016,"Moving from Nominal towards Substantive Theorizing: Theoretical Mechanisms in Management Research The emphasis on theoretical novelty in management, resulting in a high ratio of ideas to tests of ideas, has become a concern for scholars. We show that while the quest for novelty stimulates the continuous production of nominal theories via nominal theorizing, the development of new substantive theories via substantive theorizing is a more infrequent event. We distinguish between the two based on the unicity of the theoretical mechanisms used, showing that multiple nominal theories frequently share a similar substantive theoretical mechanism. We define theoretical mechanisms as the underlying causal reasoning that ties concepts together, and propose that mapping mechanisms advances the process of theory development in three interconnected ways. First, a focus on theoretical mechanisms reduces the ratio of ideas to tests by consolidating nominal theories around causal explanations, favoring the accumulation of knowledge across management disciplines. Second, a mechanisms focus enables better theory building by ensuring that all nominal theories are expressed in reduced form, addressing essential 'why' and 'how' questions. Third, an assessment of theoretical mechanisms constitutes a promising benchmark for evaluating theoretical novelty."
2016,"On the Dynamic Capability Bundles Behind Operations and Research & Development Despite its predominance in the strategic management literature, it is still a matter of dispute how exactly dynamic capabilities influence firm performance. This paper investigates the role of dynamic bundles that consist of dynamic and ordinary capabilities. Insights are drawn based on empirical data from 191 top management key informants in a cross-industry sample from two different domains of the firm: operations and research and development. The results indicate that the performance effects of both dynamic capabilities are mediated by the complementary ordinary capabilities."
2016,"Mindful enactments of misalignments between the ostensive aspect of the routine and its purpose In this empirical study, we address the relationship individual action and change in organizational routines. In particular, we explore why mindful individuals break away from established routines, producing discontinuousness in routine dynamics and changes in ostensive aspects of routines. The results are based on eight years of in-depth qualitative exploration of a strategically sampled case of a project-based organization offering professional engineering services globally. During the investigation of a distinct safety testing and certification routine, the ostensive aspect of the routine was fundamentally changed. Before the change of the ostensive aspect of the routine, we observed many patterns-in-variety of the same routine. By unfolding what happened, we theorize on the role of individual action in routine dynamics and the causes behind the change of the ostensive aspect of the routine. Whereas extant research have emphasized less-mindful routine change we reveal how tension between the ostensive elements of a routine and internal and external pressure drive routine changes when mindful individual enact the ostensive routine. Contradictory to extant research on routine change - emphasizing that routines either change based on cognitive processes of the actor or by exogenous influence - we contribute with increased knowledge of how routines change due to the interplay between generative (cognition and action) and exogenous factors."
2016,"Paradoxes in servitization When implementing transitions to provide solutions, companies may face a service paradox  a circumstance in which contradictory and connected tensions exist concurrently. This study contributes to the literature on industrial service transition by applying organizational paradox theory to understand the paradoxes faced by servitizing manufacturing companies. By applying the comparative case study methodology (33 interviews in 5 case companies and an analysis of vast documentary data), this study recognizes four paradoxes of servitization in the dimensions of learning, organizing, performing, and belonging and also recognizes six tensions between paradoxes, which lead to the creation of new paradoxes. For researchers, this study contributes by developing an approach to analyze the paradoxes of service transformation; for managers, this study provides a valuable tool to analyze and overcome the challenges faced during service transformation."
2016,"Focusing on Upsides and Downplaying Downsides: CEO Power, Stock Options, and Strategic Risk Taking Drawing from the approach/inhibition theory of power, we explore how the experience of power not only provides the means for CEOs to exert their risk preferences, but also affects what their risk preferences are. Specifically, we argue that power influences CEOs cognitions, such that there is a prevailing focus on the upsides of strategic risk taking and a tendency to underestimate the downsides. Emphasizing upside potential and downplaying the downsides has also been empirically observed with respect to the use of stock option compensation schemes; leading us to consider how power and stock option compensation may interact in explaining strategic risk taking. The empirical analysis supports our theoretical framework."
2016,"When Institutions Collide: Hong Kongs Contentious Path towards Board Independence Institutions have a myriad of definitions in the management literature, which have resulted in varying typologies. In contrast, a new stream in political science has introduced a new conceptualization of institutions as either formal or informal depending on whether the rules that structure political behavior are written or unwritten. Using Hong Kongs corporate governance development as an example, I trace the relationship between the formal institution of corporate governance and the informal institution characterized by a strong patriarchal culture, aversion to confrontation, and emphasis on relationships. I examine three stages of corporate governance development taking place in 1993, 2002, and 2011  and use archival data to highlight the changing interactions between the institutions. Use Helmke and Leviskys typology, I trace the trajectory from accommodating to competing, and then to complementary. The paper underscores how Hong Kongs efforts to promote board independence has confronted numerous challenges, but may finally reap the recognition it rightly deserves."
2016,"Off to the Races: the Explanatory Power of Competing Theoretical Perspectives on CEO Compensation Despite the ongoing debate among academics and practitioners, there remains little consensus regarding what drives CEO compensation. The academic discussion has principally focused on three theoretical perspectives (the economic, political and social-psychological perspectives) which have been developed based on observations from those involved in the executive compensation determination process. Since there has been no clear winner among these theoretical perspectives, the current paper is designed to empirically compare the strengths and weaknesses of these theories while also identifying their potential overlaps. Overall, we find the economic perspective provides the most consistently valuable insights into observed CEO compensation. The political and social-psychological perspectives provide valuable insights (though less than the economic perspective) with the relative ranking of their explanatory power depending on the specific types and levels of compensation. Regardless of the theoretical perspective, we find corporate governance plays a significant moderating role in the CEO compensation determination process. Diving further into each perspective, we identify a set of factors within each perspective which appear more valuable than others for explaining observed compensation."
2016,"Leader-follower dyads through the lens of attachment theory. Attachment style as a predictor of LMX Scholars argue that Bowlbys attachment theory serves as a promising framework predicting the quality of leader-follower relationships. However, testing this idea empirically has led to mixed results. In the present, basic need satisfaction and dyad tenure are introduces as moderators of the relationship between attachment style and LMX. Data were gathered from 192 leader-follower dyads. Results showed that: a) attachment style predicts LMX at the individual level, but not in dyad partner, b) basic need satisfaction moderates the relationship between leaders anxious attachment style and follower LMX, c) dyad tenure moderates the relationship between leaders avoidant style and follower LMX, and d) the combination of avoidant leader and anxious follower results in lower follower LMX the when follower experiences less relatedness among colleagues (triple interaction effect). The discussion emphasizes the importance of contextual factors when studying the link between attachment and LMX."
2016,"The different impacts of CMO vs. CFO power superiority in the TMT on firm performance So far in the still young research on the impact of individual functional TMT member influence on firm outcomes, studies have largely assumed that empowering a function is always beneficial. However, power is a zero-sum game, and thus increased influence of one function always entails the decreased influence of another, potentially more critical, function. Drawing on the resource-based view and the political view of organizations, we investigate how empowering the chief marketing officer (CMO) relative to the chief finance officer (CFO) affects firm performance in different configurational settings. Using a multisource panel dataset over the twelve-year period from 2000-2012 on more than 200 firms, we show that whether the CMO being more powerful than the CFO is beneficial for firm performance depends on the environmental context and the diversification strategy of the firm. We find that the CMO being more powerful than the CFO has a positive effect on firm performance in complex or munificent environments and in firms pursuing a related diversification strategy, but a detrimental effect for firms that are active in dynamic markets or for those pursuing an unrelated diversification strategy."
2016,"Coevolutionary Processes for Star Emergence in Markets Stars in organizations often play a critical role in shaping the directions of organizational evolution and influence organizational survivability. Because of this importance, the behavior and performance implications of stars have been studied in various disciplines, but substantial opportunity still exists to expand our understanding of star emergence. The purposes of this paper are to examine star emergence in markets from the standpoint of coevolutionary processes and to extend Red Queen theory to predict the rate at which individuals become stars in the context of sell-side securities analysts in the Japanese stock markets. Our analysis demonstrates that an individual is more likely to become a star in a market that has experienced a recent increase in competition and decrease in rival competition, and that such a coevolutionary effect is stronger if competing against stars and moderated if the individual has more collegial ties with stars."
2016,"Status devices and Status mobility: How does success cross local and global markets? This paper analyzes status mobility between markets under conditions of local and global art market convergence, using data of Korean artists and their sales movement from 1998 to 2012. We identify three distinct sets of status devicesnominal, commensurate, and network--based on the type of quality-related information each represents and its mechanism to signal status. We analyze their effects on success in local and global markets and whether they deliver prior success (i.e. when interacted with prior success in each market) or transform that success on their own (i.e. exert an independent effect) as artists move to other markets. We demonstrate their differential effects on the absolute status discrepancies compared to their effects on the movement from local to global markets and from global to local markets. Whereas previous scholarship focuses on mobility within markets, we combine empirical research on within market status mobility with theoretical literature on status change to the newer context of status mobility between markets. As expected, all three devices have an effect on absolute status discrepancies, with nominal devices increasing the gap, and commensurate and network devices decreasing the gap. However, both nominal and commensurate devices directional effects are contingent on their origin and differential audience interpretations. Nominal devices function independently to transform the status effect, yet commensurate devices only deliver prior success. Network devices directional effects are effective only insofar as they can operate as channels, rather than signals, and therefore deliver prior success regardless of market direction.

2016,"Incentive Structures: A Formal Model and Empirical Test This article offers an empirically tractable model of how quality competition motivates producers to bring products of particular qualities to market. Quality is conceptualized as an abstract property of products which affects the prices that buyers are willing to pay for otherwise comparable goods and services. Perceived differences in quality that buyers are willing to remunerate establish a quality order of differentially coveted market niches for producers to occupy. These niches set in place the incentive structure of the market. Depending upon their position in the market, producers are motivated to either bolster or subvert the status quo. A case study from the wine industry presents empirical support for the claim that markets incentivize their participants depending on their position in the quality orders they are a part of."
2016,"The Evolution of Celebrity Entrepreneurs The popular press covers many business leaders but the level of audience who are aware of these characters can differ greatly. When a broad audience is aware of these actors, celebrities emerge. Many entrepreneurs are the subject of movies, TV shows and mass media publication coverage that highlights their celebrity status. This paper wishes to explore how entrepreneurs reach this level of celebrity. I have conducted a case-based analysis of media reports of four celebrity entrepreneurs and paired them with four low-coverage entrepreneurs with similar backgrounds but with substantially less media coverage. I have found that the media use the celebrity entrepreneur as a sense-making object to explain a new social and cultural phenomenon. I argue that the national press develop the celebrity entrepreneurs characterisations and involve them in storylines in a continued effort to explain the new social category. This process results in their achieving an iconic status. I find that the lesser-covered group of entrepreneurs remain at a level where they are well known to an industry audience but are not attributed as integral to a new social phenomenon and thus attract low prolonged media attention. These findings provide a much greater understanding of the role of the entrepreneur as a media figure, and adds to our understanding of celebrity in an organizational context in general."
2016,"Status rigidity and competition This paper offers the first quantitative comparison between two organizational status hierarchies. I study the incentive structures and the competition for quality in two wine-growing areas in Bordeaux in which the status hierarchies differ in their rigidity but share virtually the same institutional context otherwise. Status is valued in both areas, but more valuable under the flexible hierarchy, most likely because producers are smaller there. On the revenue side, the relative incentive to produce higher quality is the same in both areas, but the absolute incentive to produce higher quality is higher under the flexible hierarchy. Even though the absolute incentive to produce higher quality is greater under the flexible hierarchy, the competition for quality and the mobility of producers are indistinguishable from each other. These non-results suggest that status hierarchies among organizations are natural characteristics of markets and that their differential rigidity has, surprisingly, a limited effect on competition. Explanations for this counter-intuitive result and possible implications are briefly discussed."
2016,"Silent Struggles: Framing a New Understanding of Business in Society Recent contributions to institutional theory have drawn attention to how actors address the cognitive and normative aspects of institutions through framing and show how actors struggle over meaning and positions in acrimonious framing contests. Yet we do not understand how actors negotiate meaning when overt contestation is not a viable optionfor example when they must dampen conflict to foster collaboration. This paper presents a case study of a Danish pharmaceutical company that overcame framing contests, gained local stakeholders support and became the orchestrator of collaborative arrangements aimed at improving diabetes care in Indonesia. Inductively following the framing process in real-time, the paper presents a model that explicates three moves through which frame alignment was constructed: interactively reconstructing the field, manufacturing a common understanding of actions, and manufacturing a collective identity. Taken together, these three moves constitute mechanisms through which actors may recast meaning and positions to mitigate tensions and move a field toward a new consensus and effective collaboration."
2016,"Dealing with institutional complexity This paper reports an empirical study of the video game development industry in Sweden. It provides a detailed account on how video game developers legitimize their engagement in video game development in a context of high institutional complexity. The justification theory is utilized as a framework to analyze how actors enact different orders or worth to legitimize their actions to others as well as to themselves. The enrolment of such sometimes contradictory value orders highlights the narrative skills needed to make sense of and explain behaviors and actions within such complex institutional setting. The paper contributes to the institutional theory by bridging it with the French pragmatist sociology through an in-depth study on the micro-level, analyzing how individuals actively deal with institutional complexity in practice."
2016,"Towards a Semiotic Theory of (Proto-)Institutionalization Institutionalization is a central yet elusive process in institution theory. While macro-institutionalization has been extensively studied, and studies of its micro-counterpart on the rise, efforts to promote a framework that bridges these two remain scarce. From a Peircean semiotic perspective, we theorize the process of institution emergence as changes in the triadic relations among Object, Representamen and Interpretant, associated with individuals semiotic experiences nurtured by contextual information flows of distinctive nature and directions. Based on Peirces class of signs or semiotic categories, we offer a detailed semiotic model of institutionalization, from null institution to proto-institution then to institution, where the emergence is associated with the different semiotic categories into which the candidate institution evolves. We illustrate our framework with the proto-institutionalization of the red square, a visual-material artifact that has been mobilized repeatedly in the recent history of Qubec, Canada and has been spreading beyond its national and geographical boundaries."
2016,"Preserving a settlement despite ongoing challenges: the case of native Indian gaming We investigated how an institutional settlement concerning Native Indian gaming (the operation of gambling establishments such as casinos or bingo halls by Native Indian tribes) was preserved over time in spite of three significant challenges. Building on previous literature on settlements and institutional logics, we see settlements as institutional arrangements that manage power dynamics and competing institutional logics. Based on our analyses of the settlement and three challenges in the Native gaming field, we suggest that even seemingly volatile institutional settlements can be maintained in two ways: (1) challengers and counter actors mobilizing countering sources of power, and (2) challengers and counter actors invoking alternative institutional logic(s). We also find that these processes can be facilitated by the embeddedness and formality of the settlement. We contribute to the settlement literature by showing how institutional stability can be maintained when actors draw on equally strong sources of power and different logics to counter the actions of other actors."
2016,"Maintaining Hybridity in Practice: The Role of Instruments in Maintaining Logics in John Lewis Institutional maintenance, purposive action aimed at reproducing institutional arrangements, is of particular interest to hybrid organizations given their interest in instantiating multiple institutional logics in the practices of their workers. Hybrids ability to reify these plural logics has been suggested as one of the reasons for their success. This paper argues on the under-studied notion of material instruments as facilitating the link between symbolic values and material practice in the maintenance of institutional hybridity. Through an interpretive case study of the UK based, employee- owned retailer, John Lewis, the paper argues that a performance appraisal process acts as an instrument aimed at maintaining institutional order. In documenting responses to such maintenance work the paper theorises three factors which influence the degree to which actors maintain or amend the extant institutional arrangement. Accordingly, it contributes by providing a more detailed understanding of how institutional arrangements are reified and maintained through instruments, and notes three factors that influence this process: underlying ties to logics, others persuasion and self-interest."
2016,"Institutional Dynamism across time and levels:The evidence from the Italian wine industry. In this study, we explore time- and level-dynamism in the context of Institutional Entrepreneurship (IE). To date, theory has focused mostly on the conditions that enables IE and on the social position in the field of those social actors who are candidates to become institutional entrepreneurs; instead, it has not paid adequate attention to the evolving outcomes associated to institutional entrepreneurship, assuming such outcomes as a predetermined black-or-white pattern, i,e, either a success (the acceptance of a change effort) or a failure (the rejection of the said change). By means of a longitudinal study in the Italian wine industry, we observed how Piero Antinori became an institutional entrepreneur and envisioned how to change, first, the local Chianti DOC regulation, and, subsequently, the general legislation on Italian wines. Our study makes several contributions to the IE literature, in particular, as regards the causal relationship between IE and context uncertainty and with respect to IE across different institutional levels."
2016,"Bringing the Regulatory Commission Back In Revolving door, a type of employee mobility between firms and their regulators, has generally been viewed as a corporate political strategy. Here I suggest that the firm-to-government revolving door (i.e. the movement of employees from firms to regulatory agencies) may serve the strategic purposes of governmental entities, as well. In particular, I argue that regulatory agencies use hiring from regulated industry to learn from it, as well as to build industry support for regulatory initiatives. I find supportive evidence for this in that the firm-to-government revolving door is more likely to occur in the conditions where learning and support-building through hiring are more important, while it is less likely when these factors are less important. Regulatory agencies are more likely to hire from regulated industry when regulatory staff numbers are low, and they are less likely to hire from it when regulatory workloads are low, and there are regulated-industry hires already on board. Future work is needed to examine directly how successful governmental entities are in using the firm-to-government revolving door for their strategic purposes, as well as how their efforts might affect regulation."
2016,"Compensating Conformity: regulatory reform and legitimcy We theorize that regulatory changes that ease the entry of new ventures work at cross-purposes with the need for those ventures to gain legitimacy, rendering common regulatory encouragements ineffective. Using insights from research on the effects of institutional change on entrepreneurship and quantitative data from new firm credit records, this study offers evidence that after a dramatic lowing of required starting capital, ventures in newer industries compensate for their novelty with conformity to traditional capital levels. To support that this is a legitimating effect, this study also finds that ventures in newer industries with the legitimating symbol of an elite founder will tend to adopt the lower cost capital level because their status attenuates the need to compensate for their novelty. We also find that ventures with unconventional founders closely conform to the older, traditional capital levels. This study synthesizes these findings to offer a new theoretical construct of compensating conformity that explains the apparently divergent ideas of institutional forces and economic incentives. We contribute to prior literature that takes legitimacy as a single attribute of an organization to show that a venture can be unconventional or illegitimate in some aspects if it compensates for this by being more conventional or legitimate in other aspects. In this way, legitimacy is shown to be a more complex attribute of an organization that can be manipulated strategically to allow a venture to be unconventional in some respects. Policy implications are also explored."
2016,"Does Unfair Regulation Benefit Companies? A Behavioral Theory of Regulation and Firm Performance Neoclassical economic theory assumes that regulation negatively affects firm performance. Conversely, behavioral economists argue that well-designed regulation can have neutral or even positive firm-level effects. Yet, this perspective had little impact on management studies of firm responses to regulation. This is partly due to our limited understanding of the factors that make regulation well-designed and how they affect firm responses and performance. In this study, we complement the established economic criterion of regulatory efficiency with the ethical criterion of regulatory fairness, which has received little prior research attention. We use a performance landscape to model firms responses in different regulatory regimes and interpret the findings based on behavioral theory arguments. Our core insight is that unfair regulation can, under certain conditions, have surprisingly positive effects on firm performance. Based on our findings, we develop a more comprehensive and refined behavioral perspective of regulation explaining intra-industry heterogeneity in firm responses and performance."
2016,"How does regulation impact unregulated organizations? Evidence from the menu labeling regulation Abundant organizational studies have examined the direct impact of regulations on its intended organizational targets. However, the existing literature has largely overlooked the spillover effects that public policy can have on organizational populations. In this paper, we look at the indirect effects of regulation on unregulated organizations in the context of the U.S. restaurant industry. In 2007-2012, various county and state governments mandated chain restaurants to label calories on menus in efforts to curb obesity. While all existing studies assess the efficacy of such policy on its intended targets: consumers and regulated chain restaurants, we ask: how does mandatory calorie disclosure affect the distribution of the types of new restaurants? Using historical data of restaurants in regulated and matched unregulated regions, we adopt a difference-in-difference design to identify the impact of menu labeling on emergence of new restaurants. Not only does regulation elicit more new restaurants to be founded, but it also elicits the emergence of more healthy restaurants in the vicinity of regulated chain restaurants. In addition, we find that the number of failures for unhealthy restaurants is higher near regulated restaurants. This finding suggests that menu labeling regulation, beyond the intended potential to constrain calorie contents on regulated fast food chain restaurants, has spillover effects that leads to the creation of healthy restaurants and failures of unhealthy restaurants. This previously overlooked effect could be an important pathway through which the regulation achieves its goal of curbing obesity. Our study also contributes to the literature on regulations and organizations by exploring the effects of regulation on unregulated organizational populations."
2016,"CEO Dismissal and the CEOs Symbolic Use of Shareholder-value Language Drawing on the literature about symbolic management in corporate governance, we argue that the CEOs use of language in public documents can affect the directors perception about the CEO and the boards decision about CEO dismissal. Specifically, we examine the effect of language that signals the CEOs espousal of a governance model that is predominant in the contemporary United States: the shareholder value principle. We argue that the CEOs use of language that signals conformity to the shareholder value principle creates an appearance of legitimacy and favorably affects the directors evaluation of the CEO, thereby reducing the risk of CEO dismissal. To test this argument, we analyze data from 446 CEOs who led 270 largest U.S.-based firms for a ten-year period of 1998-2007. We examine CEOs letters to shareholders published in corporate annual reports and counted the frequency of expressions that refer to the shareholder value principle. Using event history analysis, we find that the CEOs use of shareholder- value language is negatively related to the risk of CEO dismissal. We also show that the effect of shareholder-value language becomes stronger when the firm performance is lower."
2016,"Opportunity Exploitation and TMT Organizational Configurations In this paper, we jointly consider the organization of the Top Management Team (hereafter: TMT) and the exploitation of opportunities by firms. Specifically, we study whether different ways to combine six main organizational elements of the TMT (i.e., different TMT configurations) relate to opportunities exploited by the firm. Applying a cluster analysis to a sample of 237 Italian firms, collected through a large-scale survey addressed to CEOs, we find three well-characterized clusters, which deploy different configurations of the selected organizational elements. We label these configurations as CEO centric TMT, integrated TMT, and incentive based TMT. Then, we find these TMT organizational configurations are associated with different levels of opportunity exploitation. In particular, integrated TMT and incentive based TMT perform better in exploiting opportunities in general and innovation opportunities (i.e., related to changes in processes, products and markets). Moreover, integrated TMT are positively related to change opportunities (i.e., associated with changes in the organization)."
2016,"Borrowing strategies: The role of peer influence in the market for syndicated loans  This paper explores why corporate leaders are prone to adopt inappropriate strategies for their organizations due to making decisions based on information readily available through their professional networks. A prominent stream of research has focused on gaining advantage in networks but relatively less work has focused on how inequity persists in networks. This research shows that the structure of advice networks can perversely encourage the persistence of suboptimal corporate strategies. The corporate interlock literature indicates that actors appeal to their neighbors for insight. Research also shows that people can be poor judges of their position and the position of others within a network. This implies that organizational decision makers are at risk of adopting inappropriate strategies if their advice networks are not sufficiently diverse or if decision makers adopt strategies from dissimilar organizations. I find support for these hypotheses through an empirical examination of firm borrowing strategies adopted in the US syndicated lending marketplace between 1999 and 2003. This research helps to explain why some organizations do not take full advantage of their network position. Moreover, it also explains how the structure of the corporate interlock network can perversely encourage suboptimal strategies to be adopted across repeated syndicated loan deals."
2016,"Executive Pay Dispersion, Team Cognition, and Firm Performance Why does high executive pay dispersion harm firm performance? Executive pay dispersion (henceforth pay dispersion) refers to the variance in pay among executives occupying the same level of the organizational hierarchy. There is a growing consensus that pay dispersion harms firm performance. The current literature argues that pay dispersion results in lower firm performance by evoking social comparisons within the top management team, which then lead to reduced cooperation. Absent from this explanation, however, are the details of how executives economic interests factor in their decisions to cooperate. Also absent are explanations of how pay dispersion may impact coordination in the top management team. This paper addresses these two gaps using a formal simulation model. First, we present a more dynamic model of cooperation in which social comparisons dominate cooperation decisions when executives are near their aspiration levels, but economic motivations dominate when they are distant from their aspiration levels. Second, we show that pay dispersion may impact the coordinating capacity of the top management team by hindering the development and maintenance of team cognition."
2016,"Board Directors Ethical Dilemma due to Divided Loyalties between Shareholders and the CEO In spite of certain myths and much empirical literature, the relationship between board composition and firm performance remains in a large part uncertain. Besides, there is still a relative paucity of theoretical work on this subject. To fill this gap, this article focuses on the ethical dilemma faced by board directors on account of their specific position in the three-level hierarchy, i.e. as principals of the CEO and agents of the shareholders at the same time. On the one hand, directors have interests to run those of shareholders as well as they are tied to a contractual loyalty to shareholders. On the others hand, it is likely that directors, especially CEO outside directors, feel closer to the CEO than to diffuse shareholders. A community loyalty may thus tie directors to management. Then, various (un)aware behaviors, temptations and pressures can lower their ability to monitor the CEO. Contrary to agency theory and other prevailing theories in corporate governance that only rely on rational choice theory and do not pay close attention to ethics, our model builds on the behavioral ethics literature to demonstrate that the directors loyalty to shareholders mediates the relationship between board composition and vigilant monitoring, thus firm performance. Our model provides a series of propositions on the characteristics both of the boards and of the ownership that can enhance the directors loyalty to shareholders."
2016,"Understanding the pace of deinstitutionalisation: the role and nature of cumulative actions Even when accelerated by a jolt, deinstitutionalisation is most often a lengthy process constituted by short and intense periods and long and relatively inactive periods. Little has been said however to explain the pace of deinstitutionalisation and the factors that may accelerate or slow down this process. Not only strategic actions contribute to deinstitutionalisation. Multiple actions are involved and have an impact on the pace of deinstitutionalisation, depending on efforts of maintenance and disruption which may be opposed, isolated or cumulated. Based on the notions of agency and resource mobilization, we draw out some core claims: (1) the pace of deinstitutionalisation is slower when defensive actions are related to leveraging-strategic actions; (2) the interaction between leveraging-strategic actions and accumulating-sensemaking actions explains the creation of residues that later become essential in disrupting an institution; (3) long and relatively inactive periods in deinstitutionalisation are related to the tendency for disruptive agency to be weakened and dispersed due to the lack of strategic vision among disruptive agents. We conclude by presenting convening as an efficient form of action to considerably slow down the deinstitutionalisation process. Our case is supported by a longitudinal analysis of the deinstitutionalisation of asbestos in France during the 20th century"
2016,"Multiplexity and the Tolerance of Failure Exchange relations rely on the mutual confidence that each party will fulfill its contractual obligations. When one party fails to meet its obligation, the contract is broken and the exchange relation should cease. Yet, examples abound of such relations continuing despite transactional failures. This study considers the role of relational dimensionality, or multiplexity, in the maintenance of underperforming ties. We expect multiplexity to provoke a re-evaluation of an exchange actors identity hierarchy. If the actors identity hierarchies are similar, the exchange relation will be strengthened and failure will be tolerated. We leverage the salience of transactional failure in the context of startup investments to experimentally evaluate the effect of multiplexity on relational commitment. We find that the effect of multiplexity depends on the population, supporting the role of identity distance in actor bonding."
2016,"Not all Successes and Failures are the same: Learning from extreme vs. moderate success and failure Success and failure experience has recently become a popular topic in organizational learning research. The existing work on this topic tends to treat success and failure as dichotomous constructs. However, varying degrees of success and failure exist on the performance continuum. We posit that different levels of success and failure experience may be associated with different learning processes and mechanisms and engender different learning outcomes. Specifically, we predict that extreme performance experiences - i.e., extreme success and failure - decrease exploration of new business opportunities while moderate performance experiences increase exploration. We also compare short-term performance consequences of extreme and moderate performance experiences. We test our hypotheses in the context of a flash-deal e-commerce company. Our findings generally support our predictions: we find that (1) extreme performance experiences decrease exploration but moderate performance experiences increase exploration, and that (2) moderate success experience has stronger positive effects on performance than extreme success experience while moderate failure experience has stronger negative effects on performance than extreme failure experience."
2016,"Institutionalizations Quadrant: Dimensionalizing Levels in Organizational Analysis Scholars in institutional theory investigating persistence and change are increasingly attending to the connection between micro- and macro-level processes. With this increase in theoretical complexity comes corresponding analytic challenges and areas in which theory is stalled. We argue that the reason for this inertia has to do with a tendency to conflate levels of analysis along two dimensions: the level at which an innovation manifests or is observed, with the level at which an innovation is institutionalized or reproduced. We draw on classic and contemporary organizational literature to offer a conceptual framework that highlights the distinction between these levels. We extend our framework to offer purchase on three core research problems: measurement (in terms of distinguishing depth, reach, and degree of institutionalization), analyzing patterns and degrees of failure and de-institutionalization; and differentiating typologies of causal relationships across levels. Whereas our focus is on the case of institutional theory, we discuss how the tools apply to broader contexts of organizational analysis as well."
2016,"Variance as an Excuse for Failure: The Effect of Performance Variance on Problemistic Search This study considers how variance of performance within a focal firms reference group affects organizational learning under failure.Empirical results show that the extent of search under failure is reduced when the performance variance is large, suggesting that a high level of performance variance allows organizational members to attribute the failure externally, get away from the blame, and leave the issue behind. We suggest theoretical implications of our findings for research on performance feedback, organizational learning, and problemistic search."
2016,"How Routines Drift-in-Check While Being Inhabited by Agents? Recently, there is increasing scholarly interest in the stability- change duality and the role of agency in the enactment of organizational routines. However, we are still grappling with the theoretical underpinnings of their performative varietyi.e., what prevents routines to drift forever? The development of ostensive aspects and enrollment of participants agency in the process are presumed to be influential but require greater theoretical precision and specification. We undertake to do so by studying a case of an organizational routine in a healthcare settinghow the Schedulers interact with the Callers and other colleagues while enacting the Physician Appointment Request routine, which is the strategic gateway to the private clinics affiliated with a large private teaching hospital. Our findings highlight the following: (a) how the focal routine exhibits significant performative variety while being relatively stable, we refer to this as drift- in-check phenomenon; (b) how ostensive aspects of the routine develop interactionally with performative aspects albeit in a highly tenuous fashion (c) and how the process of drift-in- check of routines is inhabited by agents who contribute to its change and stabilityvia reflexive work and practical morality."
2016,"Mindful Routines and Organizational Performance in the light of Outsourcing/Backsourcing There is limited empirical evidence to date that indicates how outsourcing impacts routines. My aim in this research project was to investigate how initial outsourcing and later backsourcing have influenced routines as practices. Cutting routines out from the organizational context cuts off the relationship between routines and the organizational context as well as temporal continuity of routines. Cutting off will ultimately lead to organizational forgetting and lost competences. Based on my nine months ethnographic study, I argue that the foundation for skillful performance lays in the mindful application of routines while mindfulness is based on temporal continuity of performing routines and on contextual background knowledge. Therefore, mindful application of routines cannot be detached from their background. Instead, the background and mindful performance of routines are in interplay with one another. Cutting one from the other means that they are disconnected temporally as well as spatially."
2016,"Fending off the shark: How inter-organizational networks manage a disruptive member entry How do inter-organizational networks remain operative in light of a major disruption? We address this important research question by studying an inter-organizational network of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which had to accommodate the entry of a very large Multinational Corporation (MNC). What is interesting about this particular case setting is that the disrupting event was self-inflicted, because this MNC was selected as a new member by the network itself. Using a qualitative, longitudinal case study research design, we find that the inter-organizational network sustained previously existing practices aiming to ensure accountability, predictability, and a common understanding of what the network tries to accomplish: collaboratively offering an apprenticeship-based training program in the United States. We contribute to existing literature on managing inter-organizational relations and networks by providing thick case material on the activities and artifacts used by member organizations as coordination mechanisms to stabilize once agreed-upon routines of coordination, thereby reducing vulnerability to events that could potentially disrupt the network and impair its effectiveness."
2016,"Relations, Routines, and Forms: A Theory of Organizational Social Structure This paper addresses a shortcoming in theories of organizational forms; namely, that none of the major theories in use today are generalizable across cultures and resource niches. Relational Models Theory, based on four models of human interaction, is used to augment organizational theory to correct this weakness. Drawing on theories of routines and ecological processes, I argue the four relational models are the basis for all social action that constitutes routines. Routines are the microfoundations that aggregate to form organizations; they constitute both intra- and inter-organizational human relations. These relations are measurable as the social networks that characterize the internal and external interactions of organizations members. Routines are selected by ecological factors, and contribute to the success or failure of organizational actions. Future research is addressed throughout the paper, and empirical examples are incorporated from multiple organizational science perspectives."
2016,"The Paradigmatic And Syntagmatic Structure Of Organizational Routines: A Probe Into The Ostensive In this paper I use tools from semiotics to present a model that explicates the content and structure of the ostensive aspects of organizational routines. Specifically, I propose that the ostensive consists of a representation of syntagmatic and paradigmatic relationships among actions. This view fits in a larger perspective that see routines as complex sign systems, with the performative aspect treated as text and the ostensive as amechanism that facilitates the interpretation and production of those texts. I apply this model to shed light on the process of routine formation, to explain potential sources of stability and change and discuss some potential implications for the understanding of organizational routines."
2016,"The Swing of the Pendulum-Momentum and deceleration from a reference point perspective- In contrast to previous studies that have independently developed momentum and deceleration arguments, this study synthesizes and integrates these two arguments. I theorize an idea of a political reference point to differentiate organizational behavior (i.e., above and below risk behavior) to synthesize momentum and deceleration arguments. This study proposes that given types of behaviors cause deceleration effects on the same behavior types and increase different types of behaviors instead of decreasing the same types of behaviors. Using the data on the global mining industry, I find that prior above and below risk behaviors decrease subsequent above and below risk behavior, respectively, while also increasing subsequent below and above risk behavior, respectively. This study offers significant contributions to the literature on momentum and deceleration, reference point theory, and organizational risk taking."
2016,"Institutional Reincarnation: The Impossible Project of Reviving Analog Instant Photography We explore the puzzle of how defunct institutionalized practices can be revived. Based on an inductive study of how The Impossible Project helped analog instant photography to be revived after its collapse in 2008, we identify the process of institutional reincarnation: The revival of a defunct institutionalized practice by bringing it back in a changed form. Our two-step process model suggests that focal actors can first rescue the institutionalized practice by salvaging core elements and then rejuvenate it by adapting it to current times. Paradoxically, the key elements of the institutionalized practice are first preserved as much as possible to avoid becoming irrecoverably lost before then being radically transformed to become sustainable once again. We contribute by outlining the characteristics of institutional revival as a new institutional trajectory and suggesting reincarnation work as a new type of institutional work."
2016,"A Typology of Problems and Leadership Approaches in UK Boards This study draws on 30 semi-structured, in-depth interviews with UK executive and non-executive board directors across 18 sectors. The paper explores the leadership approaches called upon to address business problems arising from discontinuous change. Attention focuses on how leadership approaches differ depending on the nature of the problem at hand. The study also seeks to determine which boardroom actor, CEO or board director is in best position to deal with the problems arising from discontinuous change. Findings suggest that participant UK board directors frame problems arising from discontinuous change as a combination of problem complexity (tame / wicked) and problem source (internal / external). A four problem-categories model is presented supported by leadership approaches to handle the problems identified. The findings contribute to existing literature in two ways. The study finds that board directors perceive two categories of wicked problems arising from discontinuous change: relational-internal wicked problems and hostile-external wicked problems. These types of wicked problems call for relational and disruptive leadership approaches, both of which require substantial collaboration with critical stakeholders in order to find appropriate ways forward. Second, the paper identifies the Chairman, not the CEO, as key to leading the organization to best handle relational and hostile wicked problems resulting from discontinuous change. The paper provides insight and guidance on how the leadership provided by the board can best approach complex business problems arising from discontinuous change situations."
2016,"Governance and Attention: Ownership Type and Attention to Historical and Social Aspirations The Behavioral Theory of the Firm suggests that decision makers evaluate organizational performance by comparing it to both historical aspiration levels (based on the firms prior performance) and social aspiration levels (based on the prior performance of other, similar firms). Subsequent work in this tradition has examined how firms utilize historical and social aspirations and whether decision makers attend to them in different ways and under different conditions. The current paper contributes to this literature stream by hypothesizing that firm governance factors driven by ownership type may lead decision makers to attend differentially to either historical or social aspirations. Specifically, we hypothesize that decision makers in privately- held firms attend preferentially to historical aspirations and those in publicly traded firms attend preferentially to social aspirations. In a sample of U.S.- based airlines operating between 1990 and 2014, we find partial support for these hypotheses. Decision makers in privately-held firms do attend to historical aspirations more than do their counterparts at publicly-traded firm. But we found no difference in attention to social aspirations."
2016,"Organizing as translation events: A process view of project organizations A growing number of scholars consider change as the normal state of an organization. In this paper, we develop a grounded theory about a class of relatively moderate organizational changes, which we term translations. Our theorizing uses an original theoretical lens that sets apart four types of relations between organizational actors. The resulting relational space enables us, first, to distinguish translations from more revolutionary transformations that punctuate organizational processes, as well as from unfolding and adjustment events with a smaller impact. The same framework also provides a set of distinctions that, together with 18 case studies of complex projects, helps us develop an empirically grounded categorization of translations. Our classification includes ten categories, six of which involve a shift from one type of relation to another type. For all categories we present and illustrate typical processes as well as their most likely consequences, including subsequent translations. These results will hopefully extend the range of processes that can be characterized as continuous organizational change and contribute to initiate a more systematic inventory of the various forms and consequences of change."
2016,"Extending the Corporate Reputation Paradigm: Commensurable Operationalization and Measurement The existing literature on corporate reputation (CR) suffers from substantive divergence between the studies in terms of defining the constructs domain, dimensional structure, and the methodological operationalization. The current study aims to integrate varying theoretical perspectives and build on the corporate reputations landscape by proposing a holistic but parsimonious triadic reconceptualization of the construct for customer-specific stakeholders. Customer-based CR is presented as a superordinate construct (generalized favorability) affecting three distinct first-order dimensions (cognitive evaluations of corporate reputation): product & service efficacy, market prominence, and societal ethicality. Further, relying on several commonly used corporate reputation measures, the current paper suggests a parsimonious triadic short customer-based corporate reputation scale (CR-3) that spans the breadth of the construct. Results show that the proposed triadic conceptualization and operationalization are cross-culturally generalizable (across two national cultures: the United States and India), and predict the theoretical nomological outcomes of customer-based CR (loyalty, word of mouth, trust, corporate identification, and company satisfaction) at least on the level the existing, much longer scales."
2016,"Firm reputation and investment decisions: The contingency role of analysts' recommendations Moving beyond resource-based consequences of a firms reputation, we develop a behavioral perspective on the impact of corporate reputation. Although earlier research has extensively discussed favorable consequences in terms of gaining resource advantages, we apply theory on self-regulatory focus to suggest that highly reputable firms may have a tendency to have a prevention focus rather than a promotion focus in their investment strategies. This tendency will lead the firm to opt for short-term investments in the expense of long-term investments. Moreover, we develop a contingency model and argue that this tendency of reputable firms is further strengthened by favorable recommendations by financial analysts. We find support for all of our hypotheses. In doing so, we address emerging theories about potential negative consequences of a firm reputation and provide important implications for our theoretical understanding about the behavior of highly reputable firms."
2016,"Identification-based theory of reputation A renewed discussion in organizational studies has focused on contrasting conceptualizations of organizational reputation as a more simple and generalized construct versus a more multidimensional and specific construct. We contribute to this discussion by theorizing that the nature of stakeholders identification with an organization shapes their reputation judgments. In building our theory, we develop a typology of organizational identification and discuss how the nature of identification differs in terms of relationship scope, exit costs, and duration. We then propose that the nature of stakeholders identifying relationship affects whether they engage in more automatic or controlled information processing modes when forming perceptions about the organization. In turn, we argue that as stakeholders develop deeper identifying relationships with organizations and engage in more controlled information processing, they will form increasingly more specific and multidimensional reputation judgments. After establishing our identification-based theory of reputation, we apply it to a specific contextstakeholder reactions to negative events. In doing so, we develop propositions about how the differences in identification and reputation assessments inform stakeholder perceptions of and reactions to different negative events. Overall, we position organizational identification as a key missing element for understanding the nature and complexity of reputation assessments."
2016,"Evaluative Infrastructures: Accounting for distributed network production To date, much of the accounting literature focuses on control and coordination within and from the perspective of organizations, reflecting what Hopwood described as accountings hierarchical consciousness. Inspired by the growing phenomenon of network organizational forms such as eBay, AirBnB or Uber, this paper develops the concept of evaluative infrastructures for a heterarchical modus of accounting. Evaluative infrastructures are decentralized accounting practices that underpin distributed production processes. They are evaluative because they deploy a plethora of interacting devices, including rankings, ratings, reviews, audits etc. to establish orders of worth. They are infrastructures because they provide the invisible yet essential mechanisms for distributed production processes to occur. Put metaphorically, if cost accounting provided the numerical infrastructure for the hierarchical firm, evaluative infrastructures provide the accounting practices for networks. Illustrating the concept of evaluative infrastructure with the extended example of eBay, the papers contribution is to extend accounting scholars analytical focus from hierarchical settings to heterarchies. This analytical shift from management accounting to evaluative infrastructures includes a focus on relationality (evaluative infrastructures do not represent or reference but relate things, people and ideas with each other); generativity (evaluative infrastructures do not territorialize objects but disclose new worlds); and new forms of control (evaluative infrastructures are not centers of calculation; rather, control is radically distributed, whilst power remains centralized)."
2016,"All good things must come to an end: The temporal nature of firm reputation Research on a firms specific reputation suggests that as long as it is maintained, stakeholders evaluations should be positive and predictable. However, researchers have not yet investigated how time influences this relationship. In this paper, we extend nascent research focusing on the potential double-edge of firm reputation. By developing theory investigating how stakeholders perceive and make sense of a firms reputation for innovation over time, we isolate the differing cognitive frames employed by the media and investment analysts that ultimately lead to counter-intuitive negative evaluations. We test our hypotheses and find general support for our theory using a sample of Boston Consulting Groups list of 50 Most Innovative Companies. By acknowledging the temporal and potentially fleeting nature of a firms reputation for innovation, our findings have theoretical and practical implications for understanding the processes through which the value of innovative firms is established in markets."
2016,"Modelling of Self-organized Structure and Culture Creation within Communities of Practice Research on communities of practice as a strategic asset within organizational learning and for flexible adaptation places a strong emphasis on direct management. While every scholar acknowledges the mechanism of self- organization as the core of these informal entities, research provided only little foundations to fully appreciate these specific internal processes. Applying the notion of sensemaking to the concept of communities of practice and using a three staged cycle of task fulfillment we are able to show how the internal processes of self-organization work and how shared mental models as well as internal structures and values evolve. We contribute to the basic understanding of self-organizing social entities by providing a theoretical model for further research on communities of practice. We further show that these self-organizing entities are structurally and culturally linked to their host organization, hence contributing to the question on how to govern these entities."
2016,"Generative Roles of Competition in the Progression of Community of Practice: A Process Perspective Community of Practice (CoP) has provided a vital context where learning and situated practice can be created and shared. While prior studies have pointed out its unique social processes, the role of structured and formalized competition in relation to the progression of a community is rarely examined. Instead of seeing competition as breakdown or inhibitor of a community, our study explores and theorizes the general roles played by competition. We studied Taiwans tennis community, which has accomplished rather remarkable results globally during the past 2 decades, to learn more about its progression and the generative roles of competition. We unravel three generative roles of competition, namely community infrastructuring, multilateral diffusion and transformative staging. We elaborate how these roles individually and collectively contributed to the progression of the studied community. The research supplements the theorizing of CoP by incorporating multiple roles of competition."
2016,"Blending fealty and fiat: How industry associations further the shared interests of rival firms When organized through industry associations, firms can gain significant influence over their institutional environments. But how do industry associations organize members efforts to achieve institutional influence? We draw from rich primary data uncovered through a five-year ethnography to describe in detail how an industry association navigates the difficult process of maintaining cooperative relationships amongst rivalrous firms while pursuing its broader mission of achieving favorable influence on the institutional environment in which the industry and its member firms operate. We find that this industry association pursued three interrelated sets of activities, relating to practice, policy, and representation, and that the pursuit of each required the industry association to manage a complex mix of competitive and collaborative tensions. Such a delicate balance on multiple fronts proves difficult to consistently sustain, which helps explains why, despite the benefits that cooperation can bring, there is such variation in the breadth and intensity of activities that industry associations pursue. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for research on industry associations, institutional change, and business strategy more broadly."
2016,"Coopetitive Groups in Aggregate Populations: Coopetition in the Context of UK University Spinoffs Literature on coopetition has generally focused on the drivers of individual organizations decisions to enter in or exit from coopeting dyads or groups, often overlooking the implications of such groups for an aggregate population of organizations. Organizational ecology, on the other hand, has studied the determinants of firm performance at the population level, generally overlooking the possibility of coopetitive ties forming among individual organizations in the population. We bridge these two streams of literature to argue that coopetitive groups create externalities that influence the evolution of the broader population; that coopetitive groups speed up the legitimization of their members, while muting at the same time competition among them; and that the success of the coopetitive group as a whole often becomes a valuable goal of its own that prevents member organizations from behaving opportunistically. The developed hypotheses are tested on the aggregate population of English and Scottish university spinoffs, 1993-2008."
2016,"Institutional Logics and the Enacted Resource Environment in Primary Schools Organizations depend on one another for resources, and consequently, organizations must manage dependencies. The prevailing perspective is that firms make strategic decisions around resources based on objective characteristics of the firm resource environment. Yet, firm resource environments involve complex interdependencies and nebulous resource dimensions, and firms may not always be able to objectively assess resource dependencies. Given resource complexity, how do organizations come to understand their resource dependencies? In this paper, I theorize that resource environments are socially constructed. Building upon Pfeffer and Salanciks (1978) notion that organizational actors enact their resource environments, I draw on institutional logics to explain how the social context shapes the way organizational actors assess and respond to the firm resource environment. Through a multi-level qualitative case study of nine urban elementary schools, I examine how institutional logics guide school employees as they make sense of the school resource environment and the schools dependence with organizations in it. I find different institutional logics about the role of primary schooling parallel different enactments of the school resource environment. Furthermore, I find that school strategies to manage resource dependence reflect the homogeneity in individual enactments of the school resource environment."
2016,"Centrality, brokerage and in-role performance in professional organizations In this paper, we present a comprehensive view of centrality, brokerage and individual performance by integrating a structural approach and contingency view of network theory. Network theory up until now has shown that both centrality and brokerage are associated with higher performance, but studies comparing the effects of centrality and brokerage are rare. We propose that the effects of both centrality and brokerage are simultaneously present. Work role moderates both the centrality and brokerage effects, and brokerage moderates centralitys effect on performance. Specifically, we studied the effects of individuals positions and work role in three organization-wide communication networks in an architect firm of 93 employees. Our analysis demonstrates an association between centrality and performance for both employee roles, but the contributors did not benefit from brokerage to the same extent as the supervisors. Brokerage positively moderated the association between centrality and in-role performance, but the effect was smaller for those supervisors whose brokerage score was the highest. These findings correspond with extant understanding of the effects of brokerage, but the findings also support recent views that centrality is generally more often associated with high performance compared to brokerage."
2016,"Social evaluation tools and their effect on organisational response I use the term Social Evaluation Tools to bundle together certifications, ratings, accreditations and similar tools that measure organizational performance on uncommon dimensions such as their social and environmental conduct. Using the GRI as an exemplar, I look into how a form feature of a given tool, namely whether it measures actors relative to each other or against an absolute standard, affects organizational response. I find that in terms of reporting application levels, response to the GRI had improved over time, thereby suggesting a new theoretical perspective on the interplay between social evaluation tools and organizations."
2016,"A Behavioral Theory of Exploration and Exploitation in HRM: Looking Inside the Fog This study investigates when and why organizations explore or exploit the human resources in the organizations by combining Cyert and Marchs (1963) behavioral theory of the firm with strategic human resource management (HRM). Drawing on the behavioral theory of the firm, this study suggests that organizations experiencing negative performance feedback engage in exploitation in HRM as a form of problemistic search. It would be also interesting to shed new light on how the main relationship might be contingent upon employee turnover and internal conflict. To test my hypotheses, I use an extensive-scale workplace panel survey of Korean firms between 2005 and 2013, inclusively. My findings demonstrate that as an organizations performance falls below aspiration levels, the organization increases exploitation in HRM, and the organizations exploitation in HRM becomes stronger as employees turnover increases."
2016,Performance Effects of the Interplay between Formal and Emergent Coordination Mechanisms This paper investigates the individual and joint effects of formal and emergent coordination mechanisms on organizational performance. We use primary and secondary data on 192 European industrial manufacturers and hierarchical linear regression to test our hypotheses. We find that the interactive effect of formal and emergent coordination mechanisms hurts financial performance but has no effect on operational performance. We probe into this interaction by studying operational focus as a contingency.
2016,"Senior Managers Network Tie Use While the importance or even necessity to build and maintain resourceful social networks appears as a forthright fact, there is still a lack of certainty as to who benefits from the resources that can be accessed through senior managers networks, and under what conditions. In this paper, we contribute to answering this puzzle with a sample constituted of senior managers from Denmark and their network ties, and investigate both economic and sociological conditions of senior managers tie use. Our results show that the greater the distance between aspiration level and actual firm performance, the more likely it is that senior managers will use their network ties to access resources that benefit chiefly the individual rather than the organization. In addition, we demonstrate that this rapport is moderated by senior managers social identity as a member of the corporate elite, so that a strong identification to this social group actually plays out in the firms favor."
2016,"Globalization in Action: Templates, Tensions and Strategies of Action in Kenyan Entrepreneurship A cultural dimension of economic globalization is the proliferation of seemingly universal templates for economic action. One example is technology-based entrepreneurship, which is increasingly presented as a recipe for international development and national competitiveness. But what does it mean to perform technology entrepreneurship? The paper develops a micro- phenomenological answer to this question. The case of the nascent Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector in Nairobi shows how participants in this sector construct contrasting templates of entrepreneurship that are coded as alternatively as global and local. We use ethnographic and semiotic methods to understand the content of these templates, and the approaches that participants use to manage resulting tensions in interacting with each other. Each approach gives rise to unintended consequences that prevent the full resolution of tensions and prompt subsequent action. As a result we develop a model of the local generative processes in the course of globalization."
2016,"Relational Exchange and Generalized Trust in China Where does generalized trust, that is, the inclination to place trust in strangers, come from? Our claim is that in economic action sources of generalized trust may not differ much from the sources of personalized trust. Contrary to a common assumption of a sharp distinction between personalized and generalized trust, we assert a likely spillover effect from relational exchange to a persons expectations in interacting with an anonymous other. Our research integrates behavioral trust measures elicited by a novel incentivized game with survey data using a random sample of 540 founders of private industrial firms in the Yangzi delta region of China. We show that economic actors with more experience in relational exchange display greater trust in strangers. Likewise, we find robust evidence of a positive association between beliefs in the effectiveness of community business norms and generalized trust."
2016,"Board Leadership and CEO Departures in Entrepreneurial Firms This paper examines the assignment of leadership positions in the newly formalized boards of directors of entrepreneurial firms at their initial public offering (IPO). We find that higher status directors are more likely to be assigned chair positions of various committees and the overall board. Importantly, when directors are under-valued in these assignments of leadership positions, the CEO is more likely to be dismissed. We suggest that this occurs because under-valued directors engage in negative and uncooperative behaviors towards the CEO who is typically a central figure in assigning the newly available chair positions at IPO. Our study offers a richer understanding of venture board evolution at the key milestone of IPO, broadens the extant view of board leadership beyond CEO duality, and highlights the unintended negative consequences of the mandatory board committee structure at IPO. We also contribute a novel, socially-informed logic of CEO departures beyond the traditional focus on firm performance. Overall, we advance a more nuanced view of board leadership and its organizational implications. Keywords: Ventures, Board of directors, CEO departures"
2016,"Performance Effects of Inter-firm Ties in Financial Markets We suggest that there is a closely connected tie between an investor and an entrepreneurial firm if the investor is the limited partner of the entrepreneurial firms lead VC fund. We show the effect of the information obtained through close inter-firm ties on the investors risk adjusted returns. We hypothesize that such closely connected ties convey credible, timely and precise information regarding the underlying value of the entrepreneurial firm, which is especially valuable when market conditions are unfavorable and when the investor faces higher information asymmetry. Supporting our hypotheses, we show that investors with closely connected ties to the entrepreneurial firms receive higher returns on their investments, and their returns are particularly high when investor sentiment is low (unfavorable market conditions) and when there is higher information asymmetry due to greater geographical distance or low analyst coverage."
2016,"The Influence of Institutional Context on New Venture Creation Towards Project-Like Organizing The creation of a new venture shares parallels with project-based organizing: embedded in an institutional context, founders have to assemble a team which works on specified tasks within a strict time-constraint, while the new venture undergoes various transitions. Based upon a case study of the Berlin start-up ecology and adopting a practice perspective, we reveal that  shaped by their institutional context  patterns of project-like organizing have become pertinent to the new venture creation process. We identify a set of facets from the institutional context  more specifically different types of actors, their occupational backgrounds and entrepreneurial communities  which enable and constrain the process of new venture creation in a way that is typical for project-like organizing. We thus contribute to strengthening the linkage between research on entrepreneurship and on temporary organizing by elaborating on how institutional settings enforce what has been called projectification in the process of new venture creation."
2016,"Cultural Differences in Learning from Performance Feedback The performance feedback model (PFM) is rooted in behavioral theory, but there is also a need to more fully incorporate the cognitive processes of decision makers into the PFM. Importantly, culture affects the cognitive processes of individuals. It follows that we aim to explore the potential implications of cultural differences for the PFM. Specifically, we adopt a cultural framework that compares cognitive processes and strategies of Eastern (primarily East Asian) and Western (primarily European, American, and the British Commonwealth) cultures and examine their relevance for the PFM. As a result, we offer propositions for how culture affects 1) the formation and revision of organizational performance aspirations, 2) search processes, and 3) risk preferences for financial solutions."
2016,"Are Generalists Better Learners than Specialists? Performance- Feedback Learning in Farms This paper examines how an organizations propensity to engage in problemistic search and slack search can differ depending on the positional characteristics of the organization: generalism and specialism. Problemistic search refers to the behavioral changes of an organization when it fails to achieve an aspiration level, while slack search occurs when performance exceeds an aspiration level. The existing literature on the learning behavior of generalists has produced dissimilar empirical conclusions. Some have posited that generalists are more willing to engage in learning than specialists, whereas others have posited the opposite. This paper sheds light on the learning behaviors of generalists and specialists by investigating them in the two spheres of problemistic search and slack search. The empirical context is farms in South Korea. The empirical results suggest that generalists tend to engage in slack search to a greater extent than specialists."
2016,"Institutional Change and the Exile of the Once Fittest Extensive research suggests that performance tends to improve with experiences, on the one hand, and that experiences may sometimes lead to maladaptation under environmental change, on the other hand. In this study, we examine how financial analysts learn from experiences and how an institutional change affects learning and adaptation. We find that the value of experiences is situated in the context of the prevailing institutional logic. When the prevailing institutional logic shifts, experiences in an old institutional regime may negatively affect performance in a new institutional regime. We also find that, when employees suffer from negative experience transfer, they may risk being let go by their employers and also being completely exiled from their field. However, a filed may consist of multiple subfields with varying institutional logics, and the institutional logic in some subfields may be consistent with the direction of the institutional change. As a result, some subfields may allow people to accumulate experiences that may help them survive and thrive under institutional change. We draw implications for experiential learning, organizational adaptation, and institutional change."
2016,"The Role of Noise in a Mutual Selection and Learning Model In the organizational learning and search literature, conventional wisdom holds that a moderate degree of noise helps organizations improve their performance by introducing more variation. We note, however, that portrayals of most organizational structures in this line of inquiry are overly simplified. We contribute to this literature by suggesting that the beneficial role of moderate noise is dependent on its relational presence in a mutual selection and learning system. By extending Marchs (1991) mutual learning model, we examine the role of noise in an organization as an adaptive system where both the organizational code and individuals can select and learn from others. We demonstrate that, while a small amount of noise on the learning stage is beneficial, noise on the selection stage monotonically decreases performance. Our results indicate a need for re-examination of the role of noise in various organizational settings and structures."
2016,"When Do You Dance: The Effect of Time on Asymmetrical Aspiration-Level Adaptation In this paper, I examined Cyert and March (1963)`s idea on the aspiration- level adaptation process : the previous aspiration level, performance feedback, and social comparison, by using direct aspiration level measure. In realizing the idea, I used the concept of attainment discrepancy (Lewin et al., 1944) based on previous findings (Lant, 1992; Mezias 2002) but changed prior attainment discrepancy model by dividing attainment discrepancy into positive and negative sides by suspecting the asymmetrical aspiration-level adaptation. I posit that negative attainment discrepancy will have a greater effect on the adaptation of aspiration level than positive attainment discrepancy because of actor`s tendency for avoidance of negative emotions. Moreover, I argue that the temporal proximity of deadline moderates the degree of discrepancy reduction between performance and the previous aspiration level. As a deadline becomes closer, actors give more attention to the final result of entire performance period and it affects actors` perceived need for motivation. I tested and found support for the hypothesis in the setting of figure skating competitions during successive five seasons from 2009-2010 to 2013-2014."
2016,"Between State and Market: A Dependence Model of Corporate Elite Profile Based on resource dependence theory, this study proposes and tests a typology to understand the rise of corporate elites through different pathways. Using a sample of top leaders of all listed firms in China from 1996 to 2009, we find that the top leaders of firms embedded more in the state are more likely to have government working experience and higher educational attainment; the top leaders of firms embedded more in the market are more likely to obtain political appointment and have output functional background. Moreover, environmental dynamism strengthens our proposed relationship between dependency and elite profile, and elite profiles change over time in accordance with market transition. This study has important implications for extending the resource dependence perspective on corporate elite profiles."
2016,"The Price of Faith: Political Determinants of Commercialization of Buddhist Temples in China The markets expansion into the traditional nonmarket sphere often provokes fierce opposition, and while past research has studied cultural barrier as a bar to market expansion, this paper considers the role of political forces in shaping the boundary of market. The state plays an important role in defining what kinds of goods can be traded and what kinds of organizations can be legitimate players in markets. But the state does not do so randomly, and it uses markets to fulfil the need for state building. Studying the commercialization of Buddhist temples in modern China, we found that economic performance is an important means for a state, especially one with an authoritarian regime, to obtain political legitimacy. The pursuit of utilitarian legitimacy leads the Chinese political authority to incorporate economic performance into its political promotion system, turning local government officials into public entrepreneurs and creating a tournament-based competition among them. The local government officials who face stronger pressure to develop the economy press temples to commercialize. In addition, Buddhist temples are more likely to abandon commercial practices if they are located in areas where the local government officials face less pressure to develop the economy."
2016,"Political position and firms defiance response to governmental mandates Prior studies usually examine political network effects from a relational view, and the effects of firms position in political networks has been mostly neglected. Our study argues that political position, the rank firms occupies in the administrative hierarchy, significantly affects firms response to governmental mandates. Our results show that there is an inverse U-shaped relationship between political position and whether firms comply with or defy governmental mandates. Furthermore, we identify three important contingencies relating to firm economic performance, local legal environment development and peer behavior, which moderate this curvilinear relationship. By shifting political network research from a relational to a positional view, our study adds new insights on political network effects. Furthermore, this study also contributes to institutional theory research by providing some of the first empirical evidence characterizing firms political positions and their heterogeneous responses to government mandates."
2016,"Ideological Call to Arms: Analyzing Institutional Contradictions in Political Discourse on Education Despite a legacy of research that emphasizes contradictions and their role in explaining change, less is understood about their character or the mechanisms that support them. This gap is problematic when making causal claims about the sources of institutional change. If we treat contradictions as a persistent societal feature, then a primary analytic task is to distinguish their prevalence from their effects. We address this gap in the context of US electoral discourse and education through an analysis of presidential platforms. We ask how contradictions take hold, persist, and might be observed prior to, or independently of, their strategic use. Through a novel combination of content analysis and computational linguistics, we observe contradictions in qualitative differences in form and quantitative differences in degree. Whereas much work predicts that ideologies produce contradictions between groups, our analysis demonstrates that they actually support convergence in meaning between groups while promoting contradiction within groups."
2016,Modeling the Evaluation Process in a Controversy Civil society is becoming more and more concerned and involved with organizational and governmental decision processes. We examine the case of the controversy surrounding the Quebec student conflict of 2011 and 2012 resulting from the announcement of a major increase in tuition fees in the 2011 budget. Our analysis draws on the Economies of Worth perspective to shed light on the multiple strategies used by actors to direct and reorient the process of evaluation. We conclude with a model of the evaluation process underlying controversial decisions
2016,"It's not how many but how different: The effect of investor dissimilarity on analyst coverage This study extends research on organizational affiliations and market signals to test the proposition that affiliations with and/or endorsements from dissimilar others may generate disproportionally strong signals to which important organizational audiences are likely to respond. In the context of the market for analyst attention, I employ methods from social network analysis to classify firms according to both the number of institutional investors they have and, more importantly, the extent to which those institutional investors are similar or dissimilar to one another with respect to their underlying portfolios. Empirical results confirm the salience of dissimilarity over quantity: holding constant the number of institutional investors firms have, increasing dissimilarity among investors has a robust positive effect on subsequent analyst coverage, both between firms in a cross section and within firms across time. Implications for research on organizational status, analyst coverage, and market microstructure are discussed."
2016,"Category Status Shake-Up: Organizations Strategies for Offering High-Low Status Combination Product By high-low status combination products, I refer to products that combine elements from market categories with contrasting/opposite status. Although the market category literature and status literature suggest that such products may get overlooked or devalued (e.g., Zuckerman, 1999; Kovcs & Hannan, 2010), examples of such products abound in many industries. Focusing on the status dimension of market categories, I theorize about how organizations may engage in categorical entrepreneurship (i.e., organizations strategic actions to manage category attributes and signal category affiliations) (Vergne & Wry, 2014: 79) to help shape consumers favorable evaluations towards such products. I propose that to strategically position the novel products, organizations need to consider the trade-offs associated with different status positions on the category status hierarchy. I also elaborate on how organizations choose certain attributes versus others to incorporate into the novel products and manage the status implications associated with categories and category attributes. In the end, building on insights about how crowed-sourced online evaluation platforms differ from traditional and professional evaluation systems, I suggest that organizations can utilize the unique characteristics of online evaluation platforms to more effectively influence consumers evaluation of high-low status combination products."
2016,"Looking behind the curtain. Organizational categories, status & background institutions While deprofessionalization is a contemporary common phenomenon, the case of the pharmacy profession in many European countries (e.g., France, Germany and Italy) is different. Comparing historically the USA and Italy, where the profession faced similar institutional and sociotechnical challenges, we ground a theoretical explanation of why its status persisted in Italy and not in the US. Background institutions in the US and Italy, respectively the market and the State, set the burden of proof differentially on the professional and corporate logics in the 1910-1920. Corporate pharmacy became dominant in the US while the profession in Italy. Exclusive attention to foreground conflicts between two logics would leave this unexplained. Later in the 1960, the membership of the organizational category of pharmacy in different classes (retail business vs. health care) determined the different reactions to the challenge of pharmacists being turned into shopkeepers. In the US, due to insufficient category contrast, the organizational category pharmacy dissolved within the retail business class (the meaning of pharmacy becoming restricted to an employed occupation). In Italy, increasing category contrast, i.e. pharmacy looking increasingly different from the rest of health care, elicited the State to validate pharmacists status by reserving them ownership (the meaning of pharmacy extending also to an organizational category)."
2016,"The Shackles of CEO Celebrity: A Type-based Theory We set forth a new theory for understanding the consequences of CEO celebrity. The fulcrum of our theory is the reality that CEOs attain celebrity because of specific outsized styles, or types, of leadership or accomplishment, rather than for general or abstract achievements. We highlight two such types of celebrity CEOs, the creator and the savior, and argue that ones type sets off a cascade of accompanying tendencies. These outgrowths of celebrity span the socio-cognitive (including social pressure to remain true to type) and the behavioral (including tendencies to persist with and even exaggerate prior celebrity-garnering actions), ultimately constraining the strategic repertoires of celebrity CEOs. In turn, we argue that the effects of CEO celebrity on firm performance are contingent on continuity of external and internal contextual conditions. If conditions change appreciably, the celebrity CEOs socio-cognitive and behavioral rigidities, or shackles, become severe liabilities, explaining the documented tendency for CEO celebrity to bring about, on average, unfavorable firm outcomes. We discuss the practical implications of our theory and present an inventory of research opportunities."
2016,"Acquisition spree of new CEOs: A consequence of social comparison with predecessors A commonly observed difference between new CEOs is that some openly seek to build an empire in their very first year while others strive hard to preserve the legacy left behind by their predecessors. In this paper, we ask what motivates some new CEOs to engage in an acquisition spree early in their tenure and others to refrain from such behavior. We build on social comparison theory to offer a status distance based explanation to the empire building ambitions of new CEOs. We argue that new CEOs ambition to build an empire is driven by their comparison of their status vis-a-vis that of their predecessor. Relatively high status CEOs engage in empire building to send out status confirming signals to the stakeholders, while, the relatively low status CEOs engage in empire building to send out status disconfirming signals to compensate for their relatively low status. Further, we consider the moderating role of market reaction to the new CEOs announcement and the media evaluation of old CEOs legacy on the relationship between status of the CEO and their empire building effort. We find support for these ideas in an examination of the early-tenure acquisition behavior 391 new CEOs of S&P500; firms in the US."
2016,"The Weakness of Tie Strength  Mark Granovetter revolutionized social science with the argument that weak ties provide more novel content than strong ties, but left the definition of tie strength relatively ambiguous. The result has been serious issues of conceptualization and operationalization in the subsequent literature. This paper addresses these issues by presenting a classification system for social relations that improves upon the concept of tie strength. We unpack Granovetters original argument, and subsequent scholarship, to identify three factors that govern the transmission behavior of network ties: capacity (the ability of a tie to transmit content), frequency (the average time between tie activations), and redundancy (the extent to which a tie reaches persons who are connected to each other). Empirical analyses and simulation models identify existing types of ties and reveal new, and currently understudied, relationship types, supporting the usefulness of our new Multidimensional Index of Network Ties (MINT) classification system."
2016,"Making Organizations More Meaningful: Could a Modern Theory of the Firm Help? Economist Joseph Stiglitz has argued that to better understand how firms can more effectively serve society it is necessary to conceptualize firms in more modern terms. With this in mind, this paper examines from a strategic management perspective Stiglitzs thesis that a modern theory of the firm must be based on three pillars - corporate finance theory, corporate governance theory and organizational design theory. The way in which these theories intersect and inform strategic decision-making and investment within a capitalist context is also examined. The paper concludes strategic management could indeed yield powerful insights into how to make organizations more meaningful and better able to service society were scholars to take the time to develop such a modern theory."
2016,"E pluribus unum? An exploration of and proposal regarding the meanings of pluralism in OMT Pluralism plays an important part in the social sciences and humanities (SSH). Consequently, the notion of pluralism is increasingly present in organization and management theory (OMT). Yet, while vast amounts of literature focus on pluralism in SSH, it remains largely unexplored and undefined in OMT. This affects the accuracy of research in OMT. To enhance the quality of research conducted in OMT, we have surveyed the use of pluralism in its top ranking journals and deduced a typology of uses surrounding the modes of pluralism (multiplicity, diversity, relational) and the entity subjected to pluralism (theories, individuals, organizations, societies). We conclude by providing potential research avenues using this typology."
2016,"Bringing Together the Fields of Organizational Behavior with Organizational Economics We present a framework how research on organizational economics and organizational behavior can complement each other. By doing so, we highlight that an approach that bases on a complementarity may address research issues that can be addressed neither by approaches from the field of organi-zational behavior nor from the field of organizational economics. To develop our argument, we begin with a literature review on the controversy between scholars from the fields of organizational economics and organizational behavior that has taken place in the last years. The latest findings of motivational research and within the literature on the micro-foundations of organizations are particularly insightful for understanding this controversy. Against the backdrop of the particular contributions of organizational economics and organizational behavior, we present an approach that reveals the interdependencies between both fields. This approach highlights that research on organizational economics and organizational behavior does not have to conflict with each other; instead, both disciplines may be complementary. Finally, we use our approach for revealing research gaps that emerge if we avoid the constructive stimuli of a complementary approach. Against the backdrop of our approach, we finally present a research agenda for further research."
2016,"Philosophical foundations of paradox research As paradox is moving towards a meta-theory, research draws on its rich philosophical traditions. They include diverse fields, such as dialectics, existentialism, and logic, each emphasizing different aspects of paradoxes. However, discussions have mostly focused on single philosophical aspects, potentially leading to an incomplete and polarized view of paradox and hindering cross-fertilization. To better capture the richness of these foundational writings, this paper returns to the philosophical roots. First the main philosophical traditions and their insights into paradox are introduced. This is followed by an integrative framework, which links these foundational insights to paradox research in management. This shows how philosophical aspects are reflected in a paradox meta-theory and highlights avenues for future research."
2016,"Frame Of Crisis: Mitigating Effect Of Crisis On Organizational Identity & Organizational Reputation Organizations today are in a constant state of defining and re-defining itself due to challenges in the climate and environment; which leads to crisis like situations. Crisis fog the stakeholders ability to develop sense of the situation. Framing has been considered vital in organizing information and influencing the individuals sense-making. We propose that effects of crisis can be mitigated if organizations already have a frame of crisis, which the stakeholders can refer to comprehend the current situation. We undertake the psychological impacts of crisis on both the insiders (e.g. employees) and outsider (other stakeholders) of the organization. Crisis can threat organizational identity as well as damage reputation of the organization. As crisis can completely redefine what the organization is, it poses a threat to organizational identity. This aspect of crisis has not been discussed well in the literature so far. The proposed frame of crisis will provide such lens which creates myopic effect on all the stakeholders resulting in minimizing damage to organizational identity and reputation. Detailed account on framing techniques using elements of framing in organizational crisis has been discussed. Further discussion is on effects of framing benefit at all stages of crisis management i.e. pre-crisis, in crisis, and post-crisis."
2016,"Organizational status and international alliance formation Past research in domestic contexts illustrates that alliances are more likely to occur between firms in similar status positions. Yet, in international alliances, firms come from different status rankings and international partners may become new status competitors for domestic firms. Given this tension, we explore the role of status in international alliance formation in US IPOs involving Japanese securities firms from 1975 through 1984. Results illustrate status homophily in international alliances. At the same time, high-status US firms may try to signal status differences within the alliance to reduce status competition from high-status foreign partners."
2016,"When Is the Performance-Pay Relationship Stronger? Evidence from the Big-5 Football Leagues Across organizational and managerial settings, a commonly held belief is that the pay of resource providers and their performance are closely linked. Yet, the boundary conditions of this claim have not been thoroughly explored; that is, scholars do not know much about those factors that might contribute to the decoupling between performance and pay. We explore the above topic by leveraging a dataset of 686 professional soccer players in the major European leagues. Our results show a positive association between players performance and their salary, but they also show that this relationship is negatively moderated by: 1) players popularity 2) players status 3) players visible performance. Therefore, better performing players tend to be better paid, but for players that are popular, have high status, or whose visible indicators of performance are above average, performance does not predict pay as closely. We conclude by discussing implications of our findings."
2016,"Can the learning of the board be independent from its social status?:The dynamics of CEO dismissal CEO dismissal has moved to be the second most important choice of shareholders in the recent years according to the business press. While started long time ago, the governance literature has not found a satisfactory answer for the poor linkage between firm performance and CEO dismissal. Following the recently-emerged behavioural governance theory, we take a composite learning-social status perspective and explain how the CEO dismissal happens. We frame CEO dismissal as a process in which the board learns from the firms performance feedback and adapts to its behaviourally- constructed aspirational levels. More important, and based on a theory of the meaning of time for high-status and low-status people, we use 9100 firm-year observations between 2005-2014, and find that on average and all else being equal, in an underperforming firm with a high-status board (one standard deviations above the mean), the CEOs odds of being dismissed is only 0.06 times of the same CEOs odds in an underperforming firm with a low-status board (one standard deviation below the mean). A high-status board learn worse than a low-status board in an underperforming firm due to fast-learning syndrome. We contribute to CEO dismissal, learning from feedback and social status literatures."
2016,"Status Not Alone: Revisiting the Relationship Between Status and Uncertainty This study explores the possibility that status, as a signal of quality, receives less attention in the presence of alternatives that indicate underlying quality. We argue that such alternative cues that include relevant resources, common third-party actors, and relational embeddedness provide more direct and pertinent quality information than status does, which, as a result, alleviates the dependency on status. Distinguished from the points suggested by prior studies, this study proposes that status-heterophilous relations may be the effect of those alternative cues on status concerns in that the less attention actors pay to status, the more likely they are to be affiliated with partners of different status by lowered status anxiety. We empirically test our hypotheses using data on venture capital (VC) syndication from 1995 to 2005. Our results show that the effect of status differences on tie formulation is moderated by the availability of alternative cues to infer quality."
2016,"Unraveling the mechanics of change: a problem-solving perspective to dynamic capabilities Applying a problem-solving perspective, rooted in the resource- based and evolutionary view of the firm, we provide an integrated framework of change mechanisms, that illuminates how organization-based and management-based change mechanisms can vary in dealing with problems of differing complexities. In doing so, we re-conceptualize the dynamic capabilities. Organization- based dynamic capabilities are more routine of nature than management- based dynamic managerial capabilities. By showing and illustrating that change mechanisms can be more and less routine, we argue that any organization will be in need of a portfolio that is in line with the demands of its environment to achieve sustainable competitive advantage. Our framework aids in answering many of the criticism the dynamic capabilities field has received over time, making the dynamic capabilities concept more tangible, graspable and practical."
2016,"Organizational Accidents Revisited: Situational Variables that Contribute to Organizational Inaction Organizational accidents occur when high uncertainty, low availability of prior cases of accidents, and large variances in members risk perception cause members to choose inaction against latent failures. In this paper, the author discusses that these situational variables mediate the causal relationship between knowledge of problems and organizational choices of inaction. The mediators also interfere with safety culture of high-reliability organizations and make members who argue for changes withdraw their opinions in discussions about latent failures. The author makes eight propositions about how the mediators contribute to a gap between the knowledge and choices and discuss implications of the findings."
2016,"A Contingency Theory of Institutional Entrepreneurship This paper proposes a contingency theory of institutional entrepreneurship. Institutional entrepreneurship has emerged to explain how agency can be incorporated within institutional theory. Following existiting literature on the paradox of embedded agency, we build on the definition of the conditions that enable actors to pursue their best interests by creating, modifying or disrupting existing institutions, namely the position in the organizational field, in the organizational hierarchy and in the intraorganizational network. We discuss the existance of different kinds of institutions, each requiring for individuals a specific amount of resources (ability) and interest (willingness) for change. We build on the classification of institutions into private, social and state ordering mechanisms and we propose for each kind of institution the enabling conditions that, by providing for both the ability and willingness, make an individual more likely to promote divergent changes within it."
2016,"The importance of scale on organizational attention to issues Most research on organizational attention focuses on why organizations do not act on issues that have already been noticed. We shift the focus to explore why organizations do not even notice issues. We argue that the temporal and spatial scale of processes that underlie an issue matters to organizational attention. When the scale of a process differs from the organizations observational scale, the organization will miss impending issues arising from variances in those processes. We further discriminate observational scale into its grain and extent: grain is the unit of measurement and extent is the range of measurement. Impending issues will be missed if the observational grain is too coarse and if the extent is too narrow, relative to the scale of processes that underlie the issue. For example, organizations that were too focused on short term (i.e., narrow temporal extent) were likely to have missed the impending 2008 financial crisis. This work aims to shed light on the relatively underexplored question of why some issues are not noticed, with important implications for both theory and practice."
2016,"When the farmgate becomes a revolving door: an institutional approach to functional labour turnover  Until now, the literature on labour turnover has primarily focused on costs and benefits. While this approach has increased our understanding of the objective differences between functional and dysfunctional turnover, only a few studies have considered the subjective conceptions of managers. We adopted a qualitative approach to analyse the conceptions of managers operating in the cut-flower industry in Ethiopia, focusing on how they make sense of functional turnover and how they legitimize practices aiming to sustain rather than reduce labour turnover. Building on institutional theory, our results show how the institutional systems regulative, normative and cultural-cognitive elements- affect managers mindsets and thereby their practices with regard to labour turnover on flower farms. These managers feel caught in a deadlock, unable to change an unsatisfactory situation. This study extends current research by studying functional turnover through a subjective lens."
2016,"The Case for Inefficiency in HR: An Organizational Learning Perspective The headlong pursuit of efficiency in human resources has undesirable consequences for organizational learning---particularly for the type of learning necessary for innovation and adaptation. By pursuing efficiency blindly organizations systematically eliminate variation, compromising their ability to learn and innovate. Ironically, the very inefficiencies decried by HR scholars may in some ways be the saving grace of selection, hiring and socialization processes. We review the literature on organizational learning and the literature on HR, and advocate greater cross-pollination between the two, as key findings from these two literatures suggest conflicting strategic implications, for instance, safeguard variation vs. eliminate variation. We discuss these implications and propose a series of heuristics that would temper the efficiency criterion inherent in HR processes, thereby ensuring sufficient inaccuracy and inefficiency to foster organizational learning."
2016,"Development of Organisationally Contingent Practices in Professional Knowledge work This paper aims to understand how organizationally contingent practices develop in professional knowledge work through developing the concept of tensions in practice. Based on an in-depth case study focusing on one form of professional knowledge work, the inspection of taxation in corporate bodies, the paper aims to increase our understanding of the inherent incoherences and tensions withing work practices. The results describe eight underlying tensions between two different stances on essential features of the practice that relate to the inherent ambiguities that describe knowledge work: ambiguity about knowledge, ambiguity about what is done, and ambiguity about results. The presented analysis shows how historical developments in the organization of work can increase these tensions, through which divergence in practices and organizationally contingent practices can develop."
2016,"Inclusive Leadership and Employee's Learning from Errors: A Moderated Mediation Model Although an increasing research attention has been devoted to learning from errors recently, little is known about the role of leadership plays in promoting employee's learning from errors. In order to fill this void, this study developed a moderated mediation model based on the perspective of cost-benefit analysis to investigate the effects of inclusive leadership on employee's learning from errors and tested this model by data collected at two points in time from 206 employees of more than 80 organizations in a variety of industries in China. Consistent with our hypotheses, the results found that inclusive leadership (measured at Time 1) was positively related to employee's learning from errors (measured at Time 2) and this relationship was partially mediated through perception of psychological safety (measured at Time 2). The results also demonstrated that employee's power distance (measured at Time 1) moderated the direct relationship between inclusive leadership and perceived psychological safety, as well as the indirect relationship between inclusive leadership and employee's learning from errors through psychological safety in such a way that the relationship was stronger when power distance was lower. Finally, the theoretical and practical implications and the future research directions were discussed."
2016,"Rethinking Exploration and Exploitation: A Contextual Explanation and Elaboration In this paper, a contextual effect of exploration and exploitation is examined. Unlike previous studies which have mainly focused on the consequences of exploration and exploitation, this study draws attention to a contextual perspective, as the antecedents of exploration and exploitation, to explain and to elaborate on organizational adaptation - i.e. exploration and exploitation. This study suggests these comprehensive effects of context, such as environmental context, social context, and organizational historical- context. First, this study explored environmental forces affecting organizational adaptation not only exogenously but also endogenously. Next, the effects of relative position in the performance distribution and opportunities and constraints of cooperation have been examined whether to suppress or to encourage organizational change. Last, path-dependency, an idiosyncratic factor has been established through organizations history and suspect to affect organizational following decision making was investigated. The results of our analysis of organizational change in the Korean high-tech industry from 1994 to 2008 showed that these three contextual factors affected changes negatively or positively, as predicted in our hypotheses."
2016,"Does strategic management of knowledge matter for organizational performance? An empirical test The current literature seems to agree that knowledge management (KM) can markedly improve performance of an organization, but what particular knowledge management issues should be prioritized by managers in order to achieve this aim remains unclear. In particular, the role of the strategic management of knowledge seems to be under-researched, while theoretically it has a potential not only to impact performance directly, but also to intensify other KM efforts by giving them a grounded direction, and thereby to increase their impact on performance. This paper explores these questions by analyzing data from 370 Finnish firms, using both perceived and objective measures of performance. The analysis demonstrates that, unlike hypothesized, strategic KM does not have a moderating impact on the relationships between other KM practices and innovation performance. However, strategic KM has the strongest direct influence, compared to other KM practices, on innovation performance and competitiveness. The data on objective measures of financial performance are currently being collected, and the relevant hypothesis hasnt been tested yet."
2016,"Understanding Resilience in Organizational Operations  An Ambidexterity Perspective In this paper we seek to understand how the processes necessary for organizational efficiency and continuity can co-exist with the adaptability required to deal with unanticipated difficulties and challenges. We bring together the resilience and ambidexterity literatures, and consider the balance of exploitation and exploration which allows us to understand better the nature of organizational responses to adversity. We report on a study carried out with five major, successful, organizations. From our qualitative data we make a contribution at both the individual and organizational levels. We first unpack the individual-level practices that managers undertake, thereby identifying the complex, interwoven, interactions that enable the awareness and containment of potential risks. We then identify five distinct organization-level modes of operation (rule-based, resourcing, focus, flexibility and recovery) that shape responses to unforeseen events under different levels of uncertainty. These findings contribute to both literatures and lead to practical guidance for managers."
2016,"Mismatched moral cues and stakeholders responses to an organizational accident  Research on organizational accidents has been dominated by the social punishment view, which holds that organizations have punishment or disadvantages after having a severe accident. This perspective makes the assumption that punishment will be proportional to the magnitude of the accident and its consequences, i.e., that a severe accident will be punished. But what if the accident is beyond the organizations control? Do stakeholders respond as negatively to a severe but unavoidable accident? This paper investigates stakeholders response to the type of accident that sends mismatched moral cues: high-severity and low-controllability, a line of inquiry that is important in modern-day society where corporate accidents seem increasingly uncontrollable and consequential. I posit that while external stakeholders form outcome-based judgments, internal stakeholders make responsibility-based judgments of organizational accidents, and that this explains their respective responses to severe yet uncontrollable accidents. I test my theory by analyzing the commercial service airport industry in the United States from 2009 to 2014 using a difference-in-differences approach. Following an uncontrollable severe accident, I observe a drop in an airports landing fees from external stakeholders (airlines), but an increase in non- safety grants from internal stakeholders (governments). Also, if the airport has high network centrality, as indicated by the number of flight connections to other airports, the negative effect of the accident on landing fees will decrease, but the positive effect of the accident on non-safety grants will increase."
2016,"Does What We Do Make Us Who We Are? Organizational Design and Identity Change at the FBI A good match between an organizations design (what we do) and its identity (who we are) is often seen as a key to strong performance. But maintaining a tight fit between design and identity is difficult when a profound external shock forces an organization to change both. How do design and identity change together? Prior research says little on this question because it has tended to study design change and identity change separately. This paper links the two by examining how the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) transformed itself after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Drawing on 138 interviews within the FBI and archival analysis of Congressional testimonies from 2001 to 2013, we trace how top management shifted the design and identity of the FBI from those of a law enforcement agency to those of a national security organization. Our examination reveals multiple ways in which design change and identity change interacted. We find instances in which urgent focus on design change consumed top management attention and crowded out identity change; in which experimentation in design made it premature to develop a new identity; and in which identity changed in order to support the design that emerged from experimentation. Interpretation of such observations leads us to new propositions about the interplay of design and identity in times of radical change. Overall, the propositions suggest that after a dramatic shock, efforts to ascertain and implement changes in what we do will often delay efforts to change who we are."
2016,"The Silent Implementation of Controversial Practices:Korean Firms Alternative Forms of Decoupling While studies of the diffusion of controversial practices have uncovered how and why firms decouple their public adoption of the practice via non- implementation, we introduce the analysis of a second possible form of decoupling, whereby firms implementing the controversial practice of downsizing, are publicly silent about their adoption decision. We thus expand the analysis of diffusing practices to consider four distinct firm-level responses to institutional pressures for adoption: substantive adoption (to say and do), substantive rejection (to not say or do), symbolic adoption (to say but not do), and silent implementation (to not say but do). We then propose a multi-level perspective to consider how antecedent conditions such as firm performance history and board of director backgrounds will likely influence the specific firm- level response observed. We contextualize this analysis by focusing on the period directly following the Asian financial crisis, when large South Korean firms faced unusually strong economic pressures for downsizing, combined with longstanding social norms to protect employee positions in return for employee loyalty. We find that Korean firms with more U.S. directors and U.S.- educated Korean directors were more likely to announce but not implement downsizing (symbolic adoption), while those firms with more Korean-born and Korean-educated directors tended to implement downsizing while avoiding any public announcement of it (silent implementation). We also show which types of decoupling (symbolic adoption and silent implementation) contributed to a firms future performance. We discuss the implications of our findings for research on the diffusion of practices and the literature on institutional decoupling."
2016,"Management Styles and Effective Organizational Response to PEU during Economic Crisis in India This paper explores the organizational response to the perceived environmental uncertainty (PEU) during the period of economic crisis in India between 2011- 14. We proposed that management practices and processes associated with the entrepreneurial, professional, organic and participative styles of management will mediate the relationship between PEU and organizational performance. Measures of task environment, management styles and organizational performance were collected through a survey from 141 companies operating in India. Structural equation modeling and multiple mediation analysis confirmed that practices and processes associated with professional, entrepreneurial and organic styles mediates and actually reverses the negative impact of PEU on firm performance. Implications have been drawn on management styles as a strategic choice variable, ambidexterity, and conceptualization of economic crisis and PEU specific to emerging economies."
2016,"Trustee or salesman:A case study on combining conflicting logics in German accounting firms This study examines the combination of conflicting yet complimentary logics in accounting firms. We offer three contributions to the literature on hybridity in accounting firms. First, we apply the mechanisms segmenting, demarcating and bridging on institutional complexity in accounting firms, thereby we show how segmenting and demarcating become more salient and bridging is unobtrusively embedded in ambivalent elements of practices. Second, we show how bridging mechanisms are embedded in professional rules by professional associations and that they are central to enable complementarity of conflicting logics, as they constitute a platform for establishing and enforcing the commonly accepted rules for segmenting, bridging and demarcating the different logics in the profession. Third, in contrast to most studies on institutional complexity we show that actors are recombining elements from different logics and practices to achieve certain ends and are rather acting on fragments of logics than on whole logics."
2016,"Generalist and Specialist Selection of Jurisdictional Domains in Professional Practice Todays complex professional environments increasingly face the challenge of balancing demands for specialization with the subsequent need for coordination. One characteristic of this challenge is a professional workforce of generalists and specialists with overlapping domains of expertise. Such conditions in the workplace are understudied, and their relationship to the professional division of labor is unknown. Using the healthcare context, this study investigates how generalist and specialist professionals with overlapping expertise claim their jurisdictions in relation to the nature of tasks they commonly perform. Four task dimensions were examined, based on prior scholarly work and observations in the field: knowledge fundamentality, knowledge breadth, client demands, and resource use. To carry out this analysis, I administered a survey to 182 generalist and specialist physicians in 8 divisions at a childrens hospital (36% response rate). The generalists, who act as integrators in this context, are called hospitalists, and they or the specialist can be assigned patients, based on the patients principal diagnosis. The survey presented the most common pediatric diagnoses for the various specialties, and asked respondents whether they believe each diagnosis belongs in the specialists domain or in the hospitalists domain. Descriptive statistics provide insight into demographic differences between generalist and specialist professionals (e.g. level of experience, organizational tenure), as well as how much agreement, or lack thereof, respondents demonstrated concerning demarcations of their domains of expertise. Results show that specialists were preferred to be in charge of tasks with high knowledge fundamentality, extensive breadth of knowledge, and high client demands. No significant results were found for the resource use category. In identifying features of tasks that are most associated with either a specialists or generalists domain of expertise, this study aims to provide a means for understanding who should be in charge in environments where professional jurisdictions constantly overlap."
2016,"Secondhand Closure and Individual Performance We examine whether job performance may be a function of ones colleagues positions in workplace networks and organizational units. We propose that this secondhand social capital creates value for an individual when it offers both novel knowledge spillovers and enough cooperation to allow access to and understanding of that knowledge. To date, research of secondhand social capital has yielded mixed results, perhaps because the focus has been on brokerage in the colleagues networks (i.e., novelty), discounting the effects of cooperation. In a study of 1,273 engineers across 16 business units, we find ties that span business units and include secondhand closure (where the contacts are each embedded in a constrained, dense network) can benefit ones own performance. Bridging the organizational boundary provides the novelty; and secondhand closure, the cooperation, as evidenced by our mediation analysis. We detected no effect for secondhand closure with contacts in the same business unitwhere cooperation is likely to be more prevalent anyway."
2016,"Bridge and Rule: TMT Faultlines, Firm Performance and the Moderating Role of the CEO-TMT Interface Research on the relationship between top management team (TMT) faultlines and firm performance has been equivocal, mainly because the underlying mechanisms that drive this relationship remain largely unexplored. In this study we look at the CEO-TMT interface as a key intervening mechanism at the strategic leadership context that affects the performance implications of knowledge-based TMT faultlines. Analyzing data from 101 large international firms over the period 20052009, we find that the performance benefits of knowledge-based subgroups occur when the leader of the TMT (i.e., the CEO): (a) socio-demographically resembles incumbent executives, (b) possesses a diverse career background, and (c) shares common socialization experience with other TMT members. Overall, our research reveals that different dimensions of the CEO-TMT interface play a pivotal role in determining the performance effects of knowledge-based TMT faultlines. Implications for upper echelons theory and strategic leadership research are discussed, together with future research directions."
2016,"Towards a Processual View of Knowledge Boundaries: Architects, Engineers & Construction Experts In this work we investigate the emergence, stabilization and dissolution of knowledge boundaries among experts during the design stage of a building project. Drawing on a 13-month ethnographic dataset, we advance a processual view of knowledge boundaries and explain how they evolve in face of convergent (or divergent) work tools, practical concerns, and interests. Unlike previous works on the subject which tend to equate knowledge boundaries with occupational/professional differences directly, we demonstrate that work across expertise domains does not generate boundaries by itself. Rather, the apparent distance between experts is a combination of misalignments of tools of work, practical concerns, and/or interests. Our theoretical contributions are two-fold. First, we refine the current understanding of knowledge boundaries by explaining how and why they emerge and dissolve across and within specialist knowledge domains. Second, we foreground the role of power and politics in this process, highlighting how constellations of interests can lead to alliances or divisions. Keywords: Cross-functional work; knowledge boundaries; multi-disciplinary teams; process research; projects."
2016,"Status spillover and director labor market outcomes following organizational misconduct Can status generate a halo effect that creates spillover consequences for similar others? In this paper, we ask if it is possible for status to spill over to ones peers, improving the outcomes of actors whose identities might be diminished by a connection to organizational misconduct. We unpack the consequences of misconduct for corporate directors by studying the change in the prominence of directors affiliations following revelations of misconduct on one of the boards on which they serve. Using a sample of U.S. companies restating earnings between 1996 and 2003, we find that ones status, as well as the status of others actors who have the same relationship to the misconduct firm, can moderate the negative effect of association with misconduct on the status a directors subsequent affiliations. Our findings suggest that the collective status of a group of similar actors buffers the focal actors social position. Thus, we find evidence of a halo spillover effect created by the collective status of a group of actors in the same category."
2016,"Distrust and Market Participation: Social Relations as a Moderator of Organizational Misconduct This paper extends organizational research on the formation and diffusion of distrust to explain changes in market participation following organizational misconduct. My main argument is that shared social identities between victims and perpetrators of misconduct insulate against the formation of distrust after a scandal. An important implication of this is that misconduct does not just reduce average participation in a market after a scandal; it changes the composition of a market toward a more socially homogeneous but also more fraud tolerant population or participants. The empirical setting is the ethnically diverse and contentious population of investors in Kenyas Nairobi Securities Exchange, whose largest stockbroker was expelled from the market in 2008 after defrauding one-quarter of its 100,000 clients. NSE databases provide a complete record of ethnic identities and market transactions for both victimized and non-victimized investors. A robust set of findings demonstrates that coethnic clients of the corrupt are more likely than rivals to reinvest post-fraud."
2016,"A Sociocognitive Approach to Explaining Variation in Investor Reactions to Corporate Misconduct This paper develops a general framework for explaining variation in stock market reactions to corporate misconduct by using insights from sociocognitive perspectives from the management literature. We identify two specific sets of factors that likely influence investor reactions to misconduct, including those that make investors and other stakeholders more likely to notice an act of misconduct (visibility and familiarity) and those that signal to investors that stakeholders are more likely to impose costs on the firm engaged in misconduct (severity). We test our theoretical claims in a sample of 423 acts of corporate misconduct in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, The Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg from 1995 to 2005. Our findings provide broad support for the theoretical approach we develop. Our findings provide broad support for the theoretical approach we develop. More specifically, we find that, similar to the U.S., European investors react more negatively to misconduct that relates to direct exchange partners. In addition, we find that investor reactions to misconduct are larger when an act is more visible through more media coverage, when the firm and the context in which the misconduct occurs is more familiar, and when characteristics of the misconduct signal severity and limited oversight."
2016,"An Institutional Perspective on Organizational Integrity: A Study of the Pharmaceutical Industry The majority of large firms within the pharmaceutical industry have engaged in systematic and widespread misconduct that harms patient welfare. Given that all firms in the industry espouse patient welfare as a core value, what institutional factors contribute to the presence or absence of organizational integrity? We explore this question using a binomial random effects panel analysis. More specifically, we consider what characteristics of executive leadership, board of director structure and composition, and organizational character, contribute to a firms commitment to organizational integrity. We discuss the implications of our findings for theory and future research."
2016,"You cant hide? Firm misconduct, name change, and recovery of audience evaluations Firms sometimes engage in adverse behaviors such as misconduct, which triggers firm actions to recover from the damage to the external evaluation. We investigate the use and effectiveness of name change to repair a firm image tainted by misconduct discovery. We analyzed whether firms were more likely to change names following misconduct discovery, and whether name changes caused audiences to evaluate firms differently. We found that name changes were evaluated positively provided they could be perceived to have a strategic rationale or were during a period when other firms also changed names. The evidence suggests that name changes are used to repair firm image and have effects on how the audience of investors evaluate the firm, but only if the changes were seen as justified."
2016,"Contracts, Trust, and Relationship Lifecycle The nature of the relationship between contracts and trust as modes of governance remains equivocal. To address this, we disentangle the safeguarding and the coordination functions of contracts, and theorize that the contract-trust nexus is contingent upon the relationship phase throughout the relationship lifecycle. Our data, from the perspective of retailers, indicate that contracts substitute trust in the exploratory phase, and complement trust in the expansion phase. In the mature phase, the safeguarding function of contracts is replaced by trust, while the coordination function remains, complementing trust. Overall, we provide new insights into when and how contracts complement or substitute trust throughout the relationship lifecycle."
2016,"The Consequences of Appropriateness: An Experiment on Logic of Appropriateness Decision-Making For scholars of organizations, the Logic of Appropriateness has long been of theoretical interest and widely used as an alternative framework to the Logic of Consequence for understanding observed behavior. However, the Logic of Appropriateness has rarely been the subject of empirical examination, nor have the Logic of Appropriateness and the Logic of Consequence been directly compared in empirical work. In what to the authors knowledge is the first experimental test of the effects of basing action on the Logic of Appropriateness, we conducted a randomized controlled experiment in which 710 participants made decisions in a Prisoners Dilemma, Dictator, Ultimatum, or Trust game, according to either the Logic of Consequence or the Logic of Appropriateness. We found that, compared to participants in the Logic of Consequence condition, participants in the Logic of Appropriateness condition rejected significantly more unfair offers in an Ultimatum Game and were significantly more generous when reciprocating trusting behavior in a Trust Game. In all other cases, behavior between the two conditions was not significantly different. We discuss the implications of these results, including a qualitative content analysis of participants considerations while making their decisions, for our understanding of the Logic of Appropriateness and key organizational processes driving organizational action. We conclude by proposing directions for future study."
2016,"A Betrayal-based Explanation of Partnership Continuity in the Aftermath of Partner Opportunism Despite the overwhelming evidence that relational strength is positively related to partnership continuity, strong relationships can sometimes be as fragile as weak relationships. This study draws on research on betrayal to explain the fragility of strong relationships. The goodwill-based trust characteristic of strong relationships creates the expectation that one partner should not pursue its self-interest at the cost of the other. Directly violating that expectation, one partners opportunism may lead the other partner to feel betrayed and thus to respond by terminating the partnership. Thus, in the aftermath of partner opportunism, a partnership is more likely to terminate when its relational strength increases beyond a threshold with goodwill-based trust emerging and developing. The betrayal-based rationale further suggests three key moderators: the voluntariness of partner opportunism, the potential harm of partner opportunism, and the personalization of betrayal. This study tests the arguments in the context of U.S. college football by examining the likelihood of a remaining member of a football conference to continue its scheduling partnership with a defecting member of the same conference in the aftermath of the defection as a particular manifestation of partner opportunism. The analysis provides strong support. Implications for partnership research are discussed."
2016,"Workplace Features and the Cognitive Activation of Social Ties Social network research has investigated how people mobilise their social ties at work to achieve desired outcomes, devoting less attention to how people cognitively activate, or call to mind, their social ties in the first place. To begin to address this gap, in this paper we explore some factors influencing the extent to which people cognitively activate four different types of workplace social ties (daily communication ties; weekly communication ties; trust ties; friendship ties). In particular, we explore the role of physical features of the workplace in shaping the cognitive activation of these four types of social ties. We draw on detailed data on the spatial features of workspaces, face-to-face interactions, and the cognitive activation of social ties among 91 individuals in a business incubator. We find that, net of actual interactions, spatial factors such as individuals propinquity, occupancy of open vs. private offices, and location near shared physical resources (e.g., printers, meeting rooms) substantively shaped individuals perceptions of who they speak to, who they trust, and who they view as a friend."
2016,"Negative Ties: Key Issues And Synthesis Decades after the appearance of sociometric studies of positive and negative relationships in 1930s through 1950s that were inspired by the seminal work of Moreno and Jenning (1934), a second wave of scholarly research on negative ties has appeared in the literature since late 1990s. In this paper, we review these two bodies of research and summarize the findings in an integrative framework to show antecedents and consequences of negative ties. Our review recognizes important themes in research on negative ties and proposes directions for future research on negative ties and social networks."
2016,"Enculturation Trajectories and Individual Attainment: An Interactional Language Use Model How do people adapt to organizational culture and what are the consequences for their outcomes in the organization? These fundamental questions about culture have previously been examined using self-report measures, which are subject to reporting bias, rely on coarse cultural categories defined by researchers, and provide only static snapshots of cultural fit. In contrast, we develop an interactional language use model that overcomes these limitations and opens new avenues for theoretical development about the dynamics of organizational culture. To illustrate the power of this approach, we trace the enculturation trajectories of employees in a mid-sized technology firm based on analyses of 10.24 million internal emails. Our language-based measure of changing cultural fit: (1) predicts individual attainment; (2) reveals distinct patterns of adaptation for employees who exit voluntarily, exit involuntarily, and remain employed; and (3) demonstrates that rapid early cultural adaptation reduces the risk of involuntary, but not voluntary, exit."
2016,"The coevolution of the conflicting institutional logics: US art museums, 1780-2010 Using historical accounts and archives of US art museums, this study investigates the dynamic co-evolution of competing institutional logics. There are three core findings. First, we show that different social actors during different periods wield different power on the two dominant institutional logics in the field of art museums: the aesthetic and public institutional logics. Specifically, we show the key role of resource providers (e.g., funders, donors, legislators, etc.) in introducing and solidifying the aesthetic and public logics over the past three centuries. Our historical analysis also uncovered the phenomenon of the new aesthetic logic being institutionalized without completely displacing the previous public logic. Instead, with the introduction of the new logic in the field of art museums stimulating the evolution of the older logic, both come to co- evolve. We also illuminate how a shift in primary resource providers has led to the return to the public logic. Whereas previous museum studies have investigated the effect of a shift in resource providers on organizational activities such as exhibition contents, this study explores the return of the older public logic with the change in funders."
2016,"The Company Lunch The paper uses Luhmanns autopoeietic, operationally closed social systems theory at the level of organizations, to make sense of and explain a peculiar practice we observed taking place in a large multinational company. Lunch, in that organization, stands out as an extremely important event and the procedures governing its conduct, while neither formal nor laid down in writing, are highly regulated and idiosyncratic. It constitutes an important part of managers daily agenda. In the process, we attempt to present a methodology using Luhmanns theory for the purpose of organizational analysis."
2016,"Reexamining Turnarounds: Materiality and Cultural Values Amidst Organizational Transformation Much has been written within organizational scholarship on the topic of turnarounds, or cultural change, and how leaders navigate the uncertainty and resulting conflict that change efforts bring. However, this literature has predominantly focused on the rhetorical strategies by which leaders can implement turnarounds, neglecting a burgeoning literature which has increasingly focused on the role that materiality plays amidst organizational life. This study attempts to demonstrate that organizational materiality is a serious consideration amidst turnaround efforts. In particular, this study asserts that individuals process change efforts materially as well as rhetoricallythat an organizations materiality is deeply associated with certain cultural values and that individuals interpret changes to an organizations materiality as disruptions of the cultures and values within which they are contextualized. It does so by studying an opera house and the turnaround efforts it implemented in the last few months before its ultimate demise."
2016,"Trading in Politics: Rhetorical Strategies of Sacralizing Public Relations Services In this paper, we draw on Durkheims distinction between the sacred, which is deeply meaningful and cannot be touched by everyone, and profane, which serves instrumental purposes and can be accessed by anyone, to understand the contestation over the status of the evolving industry of professional public relations and lobbying (PR) services in Sweden. Through structural semiotic and narrative analyses of industry-produced texts, we find PR services to be deeply ensconced in a market capitalist logic, by which many previously sacred objects and practices, in this case influence over the governance of a democratic society and private spheres of life, typically become increasingly profane  i.e. subject to instrumental manipulation and available to be priced, bought and sold in the market. But we also find empirical evidence that PR specialists actively engage in processes of re-sacralization, requiring advocates to re-structure deeply anchored cultural codes that divide the world into the sacred and profane by means of language. We identify three rhetorical strategies of re-sacralisation employed by PR specialists: 1) adopting sacred textual templates, 2) omitting profaneness, and 3) semiotic replacement, i.e. the act of transposing elements from sacred realms onto the profane. Rhetorically re-injecting notions of sacredness into commercial practices in this way potentially shields actions from criticism and increases the autonomy and power of those performing it. We close by discussing the generalizability of our case for other industries and occupational groups, regarding the linguistic expressions of the institution of market capitalism."
2016,"Things That Last? Category Creation, Imprinting, and Durability With the dynamics of the categorization process gaining increased interest among organization and management scholars, we suggest that the emergence condition and later development of a category should not be seen as separate stages of a categorys life course, but as a continuum. We first propose that emergence processes fall into one of four ideal-typical processes consensus, proof, fiat, or truce that vary along category authority, referring to the degree to which the power to determine issues regarding a category is centralized versus diffused, as well as category agreement, referring to the degree to which a category is agreed upon by constituencies in the society. Drawing on the notion of imprinting, we further propose that the initial emergence process will have long-lasting effects on the durability of a category, because how the category emerges will affect the accessibility of categorization base and the social cognition about this categorization. Thus, this chapter aims to offer a systematic approach to category dynamics by conceptualizing the emergence process based on the role of category promoters and constituencies, as well as the potential imprinting effect of such initial conditions on the durability of the focal category."
2016,"Elements of Organizational Identity and the Role of a Firms History Despite a huge body of literature on organizational identity, the question of which particular elements constitute an organizations identity remains largely unanswered. Our study exam-ines this question by analyzing the self-representation of twelve East German watchmaking firms on their websites. Results show that history is one of the most crucial elements utilized in attempts by firms to create an identity. Based on this initial finding, we focus in more detail on the manner in which firms describe and frame their histories. Findings show that patterns of history utilization differ between firms based on their founding context. In discussing our findings about identity claims in general, and the different kinds of history applications in particular, we contribute to a better understanding of how organizational identities are created and how history is used in identity creation."
2016,"Network Imprinting and the Variability of Venture Capital Firm Performance This paper develops and tests a theory of firm entry and network imprinting. Sociological theory of networks indicates that firms positioned in the center of a market's social network are more capable and have better access to resources. What results is a Matthew effect where the more central firms have access to better resources and can thus sustain outstanding performance for new firms entering a network. The closer to the center firms enter, the better they should perform. In this paper, I posit that new firms entering at the center of a pre- existing network are not necessarily better off, nor are the firms that enter at the periphery strictly worse off. Instead, firms that enter into the center are subject to both middle status conformity and learning myopia that leads to exploitation. On the other hand, firms that enter into the periphery develop an orientation toward external search that motivates them to be explorers. I test this theory using data on the co-investment networks of venture capital firms collected from 1981 to 2014. My results indicate that venture capital firms that enter into the center of the network experience are less likely to die, but also less likely to have extreme success. The converse is true for firms that enter into the periphery. I supplement my empirical analysis with qualitative interviews with venture capitalists to better understand the micro mechanisms at work."
2016,"Intergenerational Transfer of Scientific Knowledge and Sustainable Development of Science Academic institutions are responsible for scientific research, or production of scientific knowledge, and academic training, or production of scientists, but the two functions are not necessarily compatible which can undermine the sustainability of the science system. Drawing on a sample of life science laboratories in Japan with 184 lab heads (professors) and their 1,126 PhD graduates, this study illustrates two conflicts that lab heads are facing and discusses how they influence the shape of science. The result suggests that offering intensive training for PhD students improves their publication productivity in the long term but decreases it in the short term. Since lab heads are not rewarded for PhDs post-graduation production, this places them in a dilemma for their incompatible mentor vs. principal-investigator roles. The result also implies that lab heads can collect training cost from ex-students production by inbreeding them, collaborating with them, and gaining reputation through citations. However, these approaches can restrict the career/research paths of graduates and compromise the dynamics of science. Indeed, the result suggests that excessive constraint on students research subjects is detrimental to their career prospect."
2016,"Institutional Imprints: The Enduring Effects of Past Political Regimes on CSR in China  This study explores how Chinese organizations are conceptualizing and responding to recent corporate social responsibility initiatives. While an established body of research has been devoted to unpacking the economic factors that motivate CSR activities, comparatively few studies have examined how legacies of past institutional arrangements may influence the ways that firms respond to CSR pressures. This oversight is surprising given that it is widely acknowledged that socially responsible behavior may mean different things in different places to different people and at different times (Campbell, 2007: 950). Employing a mixed-method research design that relies heavily on historical research, I attempt to shed some light on the relationship between past political imprints and contemporary variations in the ways that organizations are conceptualizing and responding to CSR pressures. The study contributes to theories of imprinting by drawing attention to how contextual conditions within which imprints are initially infused into structures and practices influences subsequent organizational decisions and actions."
2016,"Bound to Be Free: Occupational Norms, Sensemaking and the Appropriation of Social Media at Work In this study of a European Publishing house, we describe the ways members of two different occupations mobilize social media in order to achieve control over work. Prior studies have shown that new technologies can be an occasion for either loss or gain of control over tasks at work. We highlight the role of occupational norms in mediating this differential role of technology on the maintenance of control over work. In particular, we find that one professional occupation with strong norms of autonomy interprets and leverages social media as an opportunity to gain more autonomous control over work while another occupation that values autonomous control less constructs the new technology as a threat and refuses to engage with it. By highlighting the normative basis of technology interpretation and use, we contribute to our understanding of the role of technology in the organization of work. Furthermore, this study contributes to the literature on professions and occupations by showing when and how technology can be mobilized to enact occupational jurisdictions."
2016,"Talk is Cheap  Isnt it? While entrepreneurs increasingly rely on crowdfunding to finance product-development projects, we still know little about how entrepreneurs succeed at stimulating resource contributions for these projects. To better understand this relationship, we integrate signaling theory and rhetoric research to derive and test theory on signal portfolios, explaining when and how substantive and rhetorical signals interact to affect resource contributions to crowdfunded projects. We theorize positive as well as negative interaction effects between substantive and rhetorical signals, suggesting that signal complementary and redundancy drive signal-portfolio outcomes. An empirical analysis with longitudinal data covering 2,702 observations of signaling and resource contributions from 197 crowdfunded product-development projects supports our hypotheses. These insights extend signaling theory by offering a theory of signal interdependence, explaining how entrepreneurs signal-portfolio performance is positively or negatively affected using specific combinations of signals, and how redundancy of these signals can lead to negative outcomes."
2016,"Material Agency as Counter-Performativity: A Second-Order Perspective The nature of material agency has been questioned, dismissed, and debated but never quite resolved. In this paper we return to an examination of what is material agency, how does it manifest itself, when does it have capacity, can it be made stronger, or as agency goes  can it overtake completely? Basing our work within the rich history of materiality studies in STS, cultural anthropology, sociology and sociomateriality we complement this rich tradition with our conceptual framework. More specifically our conceptual paper theorizes and contributes to existing work by providing; a) an analytical framework to describe, analyse and theorize material agency that uses ideas of circularity and second order observations as agential cuts to unpack the movement of agency between actors; b) a detailed and nuanced taxonomy of weak and radical forms of materiality; and c) an explanation of how and why material agency is more a continuum of movement where agency flows rather than stationary moments or purely intrinsic qualities of objects."
2016,"Labels and the Returns to Typicality Claiming membership in a particular category invites comparison with others currently or previously associated with that category. A candidate's features may be representative of those in the category, or they may diverge from what has appeared before. Being typical of a category can again aid audiences in making evaluations, but atypical actors may appeal to variety-seeking audiences. The dynamics of typicality have been studied recently in economic sociology, but again the general approach has been to use settings with well-established labels. This invites the question, can typicality even be assessed in the absence of labels? If so, how is typicality evaluated with and without labels present? Extending expectations of the categorical imperative in market categories research, I hypothesize that typicality contributes positively to evaluation, but only in the presence of labels. Leveraging a natural experiment on the crowdfunding platform Prosper, I find that typicality is negatively associated with funding before labels are present, but a curvilinear, u-shaped relationship is manifest once labels are adopted. These results bring into question the long-standing notion in market categories research that typicality is necessarily favorable."
2016,"Harnessing multiple voices: What mechanisms support judgment under institutional complexity? Previous research has largely considered institutional complexity as a condition that organizations need to mitigate. In the present work, we explore instead whether there are certain mechanisms that allow individuals to harness such complexity productively. To address this, we focus on a pan-European business incubation program, engaged in technology transfer, and identify three primary logics that guide its decision process, namely state, market and technology. We find that during the project evaluations, there are three key mechanisms, which support the tender evaluation board in selecting new ventures. These are the presence of sequential interdependence among the criteria informed by different logics; non-compensatory decision rules; and the use of spatially demarcated discussion playgrounds with a fixed membership structure for every evaluation meeting. We also observe individual-level variation in the granularity of members understanding of the different logics, based on their tenure in the program and type of prior experience."
2016,"Performance Feedback, Vertical and Horizontal Pay Dispersions, and International Diversification Various theoretical perspectives have been evoked to explain why firms engage in international diversification. However, these theories have been criticized for implicitly assuming that firms internationalize for similar reasons and that contexts do not matter. To remedy this theoretical limitation, we build a conceptual framework premised on the behavioral theory of the firm, tournament theory, and social comparison theory. We investigate how international diversification responds to performance relative to the aspiration level while also establishing boundary conditions for the predicted main effects by examining the moderating influences of vertical pay disparity and horizontal pay dispersion. Empirical results based on a panel dataset of 1,365 firm-year observations from Standard and Poors 500 firms for the period from 1996 to 2006 strongly support our hypotheses."
2016,"Divergent Impacts of Law on Law Firm Practice Extensive research on the relationship between law and organizations has been performed in the organizations literature. Entrepreneurship research has focused on economic spillover effects of law and viewed legislative change as a source of business opportunities. Law and organizations scholars have viewed law as an element of the wider institutional environment surrounding organizations. However, few attempts have been made to analyze the relationship between law and organizations realizing that law can simultaneously have both characteristics. This paper argues that employment discrimination laws and legal environments at the state level have separate impacts on law firm practice. Both the number of employment discrimination complaints that state employment discrimination laws allow employees to file and the progressiveness of state legal environments which law firm clients are subject to will affect organizations need to hire outside law firms. The findings confirm that an increase in the number of employment complaints in a given state is positively associated with the likelihood of in-state law firms practicing employment law but that progressive or employee-friendly state legal environments, measured by the number of enacted state employment discrimination laws, decrease that likelihood."
2016,"Agency blind to consequences: The persistence of inequality in the South African mining sector We explore how inequality persists even in those instances where the oppressed win political power from their oppressors. Focusing on changes to mine workers accommodation during the transition to democracy in South Africa, we build on and extend previous research by: 1) extending our knowledge of the institutional work of oppression; 2) identifying how the dismantling of oppressive regimes can create institutional voids; 3) explaining how actors respond to this void through the institutional work of bricolage, in which selected elements of old and salient new logics are combined in practices of symbolic rejection, emulation, and implicit grounding; and 4) showing how the bricolage process is circumscribed by a global trend to individual agency, which in combination with the absence of a strong collective actor leads to the continued immiseration of the poor and the perpetuation of inequality."
2016,"Management Theorys Faustian Bargain: Complicity, Conquest, and the Modern Corporation Markets create social consequences such as material gains for society; but often at the cost of the exploitation of some by others. Markets enable the creation of new value; but also enable the creation of inequality, and of a complicit society in the exploitation of its members and in some respects of the corporate form itself. In this paper we argue that certain mechanisms that foster exploitation have not been systematically investigated in management and organization research; and that lack of formalized conceptualizations regarding these mechanisms promotes societys complicity in negative consequences. The task that we undertake in this paper is to integrate, from a management theory perspective, sociological conceptions of the two related concepts: exploitation (Marx) and closure (Weber)and thus offer an account of the relation between the modern corporation and society. Finally, we offer implications of our model for future management research."
2016,"How Individual Debt Influences Income Inequality: A Wage-Bargaining Perspective While there has been much discussion of how income inequality drives individual debt, the literature has overlooked the opposite question, i.e. how individual debt drives income inequality. In this paper, we use a wage-bargaining perspective to explain how high individual debt exacerbates the level of income inequality in a society. We propose that a high level of debt has an adverse impact on individuals wage-bargaining: position, ability and willingness. In the context of wage negotiations, this situation results in lower wages for individuals with high levels of debt in comparison to individuals with low levels of debt. These lower individual wages then engender increased income inequality in society at large. By using a wage-bargaining perspective to understand how individual debt drives inequality, we uncover several important implications for research and practice."
2017,"Faster, Hotter, and More Linked In: Managing Social Disapproval in the Social Media Era Negative organizational evaluations and the response strategy a firm employs to manage them have garnered significant attention among management scholars. However, past research has focused almost exclusively on the role of traditional media, with little attention given to how the addition of social media has changed the dynamics of organizational evaluations and firm responses. Extending current research, we define social disapproval as constituents general enmity toward a firm and distinguish its attributes from other negative evaluations such as stigma and negative reputation. Drawing on communication and social psychology literature, we theorize that the key communication characteristics in the social media era greater velocity, emotionality, and communalityhave important ramifications for social disapproval and how firms manage it. Accordingly, we develop new theory about how characteristics of a firms response strategyspeed, accommodativeness, and frequency affect social disapproval, and we also consider the option of self- announcing negative news. We contribute to social evaluations and impression management research by developing a testable model that recognizes how the addition of social media to traditional media facilitates social disapproval and thus requires a different response strategy."
2017,"Social Valuation across Multiple Audiences: The Interplay of Ability and Identity Judgments How do evaluators judge candidates positively evaluated by an external, non-peer audience? This question is critical to individuals and organizations reaching out to various audiences for key resources. Complementing prior works that document how evaluators rely on available indices about past appreciations to evaluate candidates, we highlight a critical yet overlooked distinction between endogenous indices, certified by a peer audience, and exogenous indices, originating in an external audience. While indices of past appreciations positively influence peer valuation by conveying information about the candidates unobservable abilities, exogenous indices, we argue, may also be indicative of candidates failure to conform to an expected peer identity. The combination of the two opposite effects suggests an inverted-U shaped relationship between exogenous indices and peer valuation, mitigated by the identity proximity between the peer audience and the external audience, and the availability of informative endogenous indices. We test and find support for our arguments using empirical evidence on the peer valuation of 9,500 academic scientists at a leading research university applying for research grants. Our work contributes to the understanding of valuation and socially endogenous inferences, and has important implications for the management of organizations in complex environments."
2017,"Different Strokes for the Same Folks: The Effect of Information Architectures on Social Valuations Social evaluation platforms for products, services, workers, and organizations are ubiquitous. Scholars have studied the social determinants of these collective endeavors, tracing how attributes of evaluators, the social context of evaluation, and the evaluated entities influence valuation dynamics. Yet, little work has investigated the role that the information architectures on which valuations are carried out play in the dynamics of collectively generated evaluations. By exploiting millions of beer ratings on two distinct online rating platforms, I show that individuals rate the same beer differently on each platform due to relatively small and seemingly insignificant differences in the information configuration of these platforms and the pattern of collective judgment dynamics they engender. I find that information architectures with finer grained, inconsistently configured, and harder to compute scales condition lower ratings and preclude social influence to a greater degree. The results suggest that some information architectures can do a better job of translating internal mental representations of value into accurate and non- biased collective measures of value. These results inform the ever-prevalent role of ratings in organizational and economic life, including product, service, and employee reviews. The paper concludes by suggesting how the study of information architectures can provide insights on human behavior in other contexts of social action."
2017,"What Do You Meme?: How Internet Memes Affect Organizations Social Evaluations Internet memes are an increasingly common form of media, produced and shared by the general public. Despite the prevalence and ubiquity of the phenomenon, organizational research has yet to theoretically examine the effects of internet memes on organizations. We develop a conceptual framework explaining how organizational images are generated, altered, and shared through internet memes. We advance research on memes by introducing the concept of organizational memes--memes that incorporate an organizational image that are duplicated and shared numerous times by multiples users. We theorize that the distribution of these types of internet memes can impact constituents social judgements toward an organization. In all, our study contributes to an emerging body of research using social media to expand our understanding of the effects of public generated media on organizational evaluators."
2017,"Shared Education Affiliations and Workplace Relationships Literature on labor markets indicate educational affiliations hold signaling value that affects how individuals and organizations are matched. In this paper we argue that educational affiliations are additionally used as a basis of allocation within organizations. We test and find support for our core proposition in two different data sets on the law industry. First, an industry-wide data set indicates two lawyers who graduated from the same law school are more likely to be allocated to the same work group within organizations than two who do not share an educational affiliation. Second, data collected from a large international firm indicate two lawyers who graduated from the same law school are more likely to be allocated to the same hierarchical relationship than two lawyers who did not. Implications of this study for research on networks, inequality, and careers are discussed."
2017,"Middle-Managers and their Boundary Work: An Ethnographic Study How managers facilitate cross-functional collaboration across intraorganizational symbolic boundaries separating actors has been a seminal and persistent academic puzzle. Whereas these boundaries may represent barricades to collaboration, their overcoming and management may enable latent opportunities for collaboration, knowledge transfer and innovation to manifest. Drawing upon a multi-site ethnographic study of middle-managers in a Brazilian accounting firm, we demonstrate how these managers resolve disparities manifested at boundaries. They sustain varieties of boundary work so as to dynamically keep influencing and capitalizing on the sensitive relations at three increasingly intricate boundary domains: the syntactic, the semantic and the political. We theorize and illustrate our boundary work concept, and identify its scholarly and practical affordances and limitations for understanding middle- managers work capabilities on cross-functional collaboration."
2017,"Reconciling Good Relationships at Work and Workplace Instrumentality: An In-Depth Case Study Relationships at work are a crucial feature for the well-being of people in organizations. For this reason we want to contribute to advancing knowledge on factors enhancing the positive experience of relationships at work. From our in- depth case study of a communication agency we were surprised to observe that nice relationships could go with a ruthless instrumentality, people being only worth to their immediate contribution to organizational aims. Enquiring how individuals manage to reconcile these two features of the workplace, we find that they engage in skillful emotion work that strictly bounds the depth of relations to each other. This discovery leads us first to consider the role of instrumentality for the experience of work relationships, as opposed to nonwork relationships, and second to show that the phenomenon of emotion work in work relationships is concurrently professionally and personally driven."
2017,"Its Play Time: Work and True Play in a High Tech Organization Based on an ethnographic field study, we examine how playfulness coexists with work in organizations. Our findings reveal true play as a new kind of play in work organizations, a type of play which is intense and absorbing, volitional, and spatially and temporally interlaced with work. We identify the enabling conditions that allow people to maintain a dual focus on both intense work and true play. Our findings enrich the literature on play and work in organizations, and extend Huizingas anthropological theory of play."
2017,"How do Cultural Organizations in Semi-Peripheral Positions Pursue Legitimacy? At present, it is still unclear how and how far mimetic isomorphism diffuses to particular places. There is an understandable tendency to study organizations in core industry cities which create products for national and international distributionNew York and Boston for finance, Hollywood and Los Angeles for film, New York for fashionrather than peripheral cities with regional audiences. Here, I take up the case of fashion in a second city, Philadelphia, to understand how and what kind of legitimacy producers pursue. I argue that the ambivalence of split legitimacy has been undertheorized. At the same time that producers pursue some standards of a dominant New York, they cannot compete in terms of symbolic content. They thus embrace a Grade B vision which also cultivates legitimacy from the local community. This paper draws on ethnographic and interview data from Philadelphia Fashion Week, as well as other fashion shows, modeling agencies, and industry trade groups in the city; the case of New York functions as a theoretical and empirical counterpoint. I show that while Philadelphia producers often aspire to New York standards, they face a different market environment with less support from the city government, media, and sponsors. The paper considers the impact of semi-peripheral location on the symbolic content of cultural organizations."
2017,"Legitimation of Hybrid Organizations: A Recursive Perspective ABSTRACT Based on an in-depth case study of Goonj, an NGO in India combining charity, community development, and commercial logics, I advance an evaluation based approach to legitimation of hybrid organizations. I examine a recursive relationship between organizational actions and the legitimacy evaluations of these actions expressed through discursive means. I contribute to research on hybrid organizations by complementing existing outcome based approach to legitimacy with an approach where legitimacy is an evaluation based on organizational characteristics. Further, I examine legitimacy evaluations by both internal and external stakeholders, thus departing from extant research examining only internal organizational actions or those of internal stakeholders. I also identified four themes of legitimation in the context of hybrid organizations - delegitimation of existing systems, legitimation of individual logics, legitimation of commonalities, and legitimation of coupled logics  which were composed of different discursive strategies like rationalization, moralization, authorization, narrativization, use of metaphors, and categorization. The present study also provides insights to the literature on emergence of hybrid organizations."
2017,"The Dark Side of Liquidity: Shedding Light on Dark Pools' Marketing and Market Making Scholars in sociology, political economy and other cognate disciplines have disregarded dark pools of liquidity. This inattention is puzzling particularly for those researchers who study the social construction of liquid markets. After all, given their opaque features, dark pools clearly show how investors must rely on intersubjective representations to evaluate whether markets are liquid, sharing images of trading infrastructures that are not visible. In this article, we study how dark-pool venues shape the idea of liquidity into a commercial discourse, promoting a service that they do not offer transparently. We argue that dark pools embody a shift in the production of liquidity: from market making to marketing. In fact, many dark-liquidity providers put forward visual advertisements which aim at informing investors and making up for the lack of trading-related information. We deploy semiotic tools to study how dark-pool venues use iconic visual signs to influence investors evaluation of market liquidity. Particularly, we build on Roland Barthes to provide an in-depth semiotic analysis of the exemplary advertisement for JPMorgan Lighthouse."
2017,"Keeping a Dream Alive: Multimodal Study of the Construction Sector's Industrialization 1945-1970 Rational myths provide idealized cultural accounts that specify the appropriate means that organizations should adopt to rationally pursue socially valuable ends. Being taken for granted, rational myths eschew demonstrations that they actually hold true. Our empirical study uses visual and verbal data to examine how proponents of the rational myth of industrialization introduced and sustained this myth within the French construction industry after WWII. We identify three consecutive steps through which proponents introduced and sustained this rational myth, and specify the powerful suggestive role of visual representations. At the beginning of the process, the equivocal interpretation of visuals allows early associations between means and ends that precede verbal couplings. In the last phase, visual representation reinforces the couplings between means and substantive ends, enabling the myth of industrialization to draw on both formal rationality and substantive rationality, and transcending any potential incompatibility between them. We theorize the complementarities of the verbal mode and the visual mode in the process of introducing and sustaining a rational myth within a field."
2017,"Player Market Value and the Stigma of Relegation: Evidence from a Regression Discontinuity The stigma of organizational failure may prove harmful for the organization's employees and managers, but research has yet to determine when stigma arises in the aftermath of failure. I study the existence of stigma in a setting characterized by recurrent failures and a wealth of information -- association football, where several teams are relegated at the end of each season. I overcome the endogeneity of potentially lower ability players in relegated teams by exploiting the similarity of teams around the relegation line in a sharp regression discontinuity design to obtain a causal effect of team relegation on player market value. In the Spanish Primera Divisin, this effect is negative, economically significant, and robust. I assess whether players on loan to relegated teams, expected to continue playing in the top tier, are also affected by relegation. I provide evidence that they are not, inconsistent with organizational stigma, but consistent with rational expectations of players' lower marginal product revenue in inferior leagues. The available information on player ability and the regularity of failure may explain the absence of stigma in this context."
2017,"Competitiveness and the Survival of Core-Stigmatized Organizations Failure is an ever-present possibility for organizations of all kinds, yet stigmatized organizations face especially daunting survival prospects. Often, the main challenge confronted by such organizations is the ostracism from potential business partners, which is driven by a desire to avoid being associated with the object of stigma. Economists, however, have long argued that the presence of discrimination in markets is a function of the degree of competitiveness, because discrimination is costly and thus likely to be competed away as more competitors enter the market. In a similar fashion, competitiveness can reduce the cost of compliance with the targeted legislation that often comes as a direct consequence of stigma. The main argument of this paper, therefore, is that economic competitiveness will reduce the penalties suffered by stigmatized organizations due to stakeholder disapproval and targeted legislation. Through a study of one of the most heavily stigmatized organizational forms in the United Statesthe abortion clinicI explore the interrelation between stigma, economic competitiveness and the odds of failure using data on abortion clinic closures from 2011 to 2015. I complement my quantitative findings with a rich qualitative account of the empirical setting, based on historical sources and second-hand interview materials. My findings support the proposed framework."
2017,"Fallen From Grace: Stigmatizing the Chinese Medical Profession While research on stigma has proliferated since the 1960s, much of this work has focused on the characteristics and negative consequences of stigma on individuals and organizations, and how organizations and managers differentially respond to stigma. Despite providing valuable insights into the consequential implications of pervasive exclusion from social and economic life, research to date has been relatively silent about the process of stigmatization. This oversight is surprising given that the stigmatization process not only elucidates how and why stigmas emerge within a particular social context, but also the differentiated roles that actors and audiences play. In this article we empirically unpack the process and conditions under which a high status, well-respected profession in China became progressively stigmatized. In so doing, we employ a longitudinal cross-level research design to examine the complexities and contextual nature of the stigmatization process. In addition, our study draws attention to the role of power and social arbiters in the stigmatization process. Moreover, our study provides important insights into the lived experience of the stigmatized  specifically, how they conceptualize, experience, and potentially contribute to the stigmatization process."
2017,"Stigma Work In Action: The Case Of The Global Fossil Fuel Divestment Movement  This study explores processes of stigmatization as forms of institutional work. We base our study within the context of the fossil fuel divestment movement and focus specifically on climate activists; identifying two types of work they engage in aimed at stigmatizing the fossil fuel industry. The first concerns meaning-work, which involves enacting certain discursive processesothering and demonizingthat construct the content of a stigma discourse. The second, judgment-work, encompasses the processes by which stigma is diffused amongst key-evaluators in order to acquire the critical mass needed for stigma to become self-sustaining. We also illustrate the effects of activists stigma work by demonstrating notable shifts in the news medias framing of the relationship between fossil fuels and climate change. By proposing an in-action model of stigmatization, this study contributes mainly to the literature on organizational stigma; emphasizing the often-overlooked micro-level dynamics of actors employing stigma strategically to disrupt an existing institutional order."
2017,"Constructing Networks with Recessive Institutions: Examples from Argentina The varieties of capitalism approach in Political Science and institution-based theory in Strategic Management contend that firms overcome institutional challenges in emerging markets through vertical integration. Both of these approaches assume that market solutions are more efficient, while also overlooking how firms develop alternatives to vertical integration. Although theories in these fields view institutional settings in emerging markets as being largely deficient, this article suggests that such conceptions do not enable scholars to understand either the potential comparative institutional advantages of such firms or the manner in which firms in these countries address institutional difficulties. Building on previous work on recessive institutions, this article demonstrates how a farm management company and a public/private organization in the wine sector in Argentina rely on the recessive institution of cooperatives to address institutional deficiencies. This paper concludes by exploring how the theory developed herein could help scholars improve their understanding of institutional change."
2017,"Trust or Opportunity? Managing Corporate Lending Networks if Institutions Are Weak That social capital matters in corporate lending relations is uncontested. While the literature has largely focused on the quality of dyadic firm-bank ties in explaining corporate credit access, we suggest a supply side perspective of lending networks surrounding individual corporations. Our theory predicts that corporations benefit from network closure in their lending networks, but less so, if institutional conditions surrounding the firm guarantee the predictable enforcement of credit contracts. We use a panel of 515 corporations listed on Chinas Stock Exchanges holding a total of 7009 major bank loans granted by 183 distinct banks during the period from 2007 to 2012 to test our theoretical framework. Our findings support the hypothesized positive effect of closure. Our findings also robustly confirm that closure offers fewer advantages if the institutional environment provides credible mechanisms helping to produce institutionalized trust between contract partners. These findings are robust to various specifications. More generally our findings contribute to the relational lending literature as well as an emerging literature highlighting how the interplay between network structures and formal institutions shapes individual and corporate strategies."
2017,"Scaling up Good Ideas: Institutional Work from the Margins The idea of practice has been applied to organization theory, strategic management, human resources, and accounting. However, extant research on practice work in institutional theory is at a level of abstraction that provides very generic guidelines to practitioners. We present a study of institutional change enabled by the Child In Need Institute (CINI), a non-profit organization working to eradicate child malnutrition in India. We examine forty years of archival data, triangulated with interviews and field observations, to understand CINIs work since its inception in 1975. We observe that CINI intervened at two levels: communities in villages and slums, and partner organizations working in the field of child malnutrition. At the community level, CINIs work entails demonstration of results, illustrations of concepts, and tenacity in pursuing cases. CINI also reached out to partner organizations sharing common concerns, facilitated exchanges, and engaged in collaborative work. At both these levels, CINIs sustained efforts got due recognition that bolstered its efforts. Over the years, CINI managed to imbricate itself with communities as well as various government programs, enabling creation and dissemination of new social practices widely."
2017,"Hakuna Matata or When Cultures Collide: Navigating Institutional Abundance in Rural Africa In this paper, we examine why and how social enterprises may fail in foreign developing contexts despite promising conditions and initial success. Using data on Villages for Africa (VFA), a social enterprise that provided macro-credits to groups of villages and helped them establish their own village enterprises in rural Tanzania, we explore how the organization failed when  counterintuitively  starting to realize its mission to help villagers help themselves. By strategically fostering emotional investment of rural communities into their newly-established village enterprises, villagers institutional void effectively swallowed VFAs macro-credit model as rural community members started to adapt the intervention in accordance with their contexts normative demands. The increased sense of cultural ownership that villagers displayed for VFAs development intervention led to a normative collision of cultures and forced VFA to abandon its operations in the region. Among other aspects, our findings suggest the re-conceptualization of institutional voids not as the absence, but the presence of culturally embedded, densely packed institutional arrangements that particularly foreign organizations have to learn to navigate in order to survive."
2017,"Back to the Future? How Organizational Members Temporally Maintain an Organizational Identity Increasing interest is given to the role of temporality in organizational identity processes. Existing research has mainly focused on how leaders can leverage the past, present, and future in order to instigate change or provide stability in their organizations identity. In this paper, we take a cultural, bottom-up approach to the maintenance of organizational identity, looking at how organizational members draw on temporality in order to provide continuity in their organizations identity. Building on an ethnographic study of a small sustainable bank in the UK, we show that members leverage the present and future when embracing their organizations identity. However, members also breach this identity by exposing perceived misalignment between the present reality and the projected future of the identity. Members repair such dissonance by breaking with some past elements of the organizational identity and rationalizing present practices in order to project a more certain future. We therefore contribute a better understanding of how continuity is achieved in organizational identity and particularly how members draw on temporal resources to do so."
2017,"Uses of the Past and Organizational History: Bridging Organizational and Individual Level Organizational leaders often create historical narratives to bridge the past with the present and an aspired future of an organization. While we know much about the creation and use of these narratives by managers, there is only little knowledge of how employees make sense of these narratives and meaningfully contextualize them within their individual work life. In our theoretical framework we propose that organizational values play an important role as intermediaries for bridging semantic memory on organizational level with the episodic memory on employee level. Based on this framework we study how employees contextu-alize a historical narrative within their work experiences. An analysis of 440 employee sto-ries shows how organizational values allow organizational members to embed individual experiences within the broader context of organizational history. We identify how organizational members contextualize organizational history in stories through the embodiment of values in artifacts and people, through memory spanning, through the emphasis on trans-formative power of values, and through the validation of values by organizational members and non-members. We discuss how the narration of individual memories connects the past with the present within a mnemonic community of employees."
2017,"The Career of a Catalogue: Uses of the Past, Organizational Memory and Digitization at the BM This paper deals with the dynamics of organizational memory in the context of the British Museums digitization efforts which date back to the 1970s. Drawing on recent developments in organizational memory studies that stress the dynamic and socially constructed nature of memory, we examine how organizational actors evoked different forms of oral, textual and material memory to make sense of digital technology and how in so doing they shaped the possible uses of that technology. In particular, we show how by using computers to digitize the museums collection, organizational actors created a new technology of remembering that, in turn, shaped the ways in which the museums memory functioned. In so doing, we contribute to more nuanced understanding of how materiality matters for organizational memory that goes beyond traditional conceptualizations in three ways. First, we show how the material forms that give durability to textual memory inflect the ways in which actors can draw upon it. Second, we theorize these material forms as technologies of remembering and suggest that the practices by which actors evoke the past using textual sources co-evolve with the properties of the material form in which it is preserved. Finally, we demonstrate that the co-evolution between memory practices and technologies of remembering can only be told by acknowledging the multiple times in which it unfolds, which challenges both deterministic and voluntaristic interpretations of how history matters in organizations."
2017,"Organizational Fields as Mnemonic Communities The concept of an organizational field has become influential in management theory. Despite its prominence, the construct has defied precise definition. Most definitions emphasize either structural elements of fields (fields as place) or their ideational elements (fields as meaning systems). Missing from this analysis is an appreciation of how meaning is given to structural relations. Our core thesis is that memory is a critically important bridging construct through which meaning is given to place. We demonstrate that organizational fields are historical accretions of shared memories that are reproduced and become objectified over time until they acquire the status of ontological reality. We introduce the term mnemonic fields to capture the understanding that fields are cognitions of network relations that are created, maintained and changed through processes of collective memory."
2017,"Social Capital or Relational Baggage? The Cost of Collaboration in Adversarial Contests This study explores how a collaborative history between agents exacerbates conflict between their respective principals. Research on social embeddedness suggests that past collaboration between actors facilitates future collaboration. In contrast to this view, we explicate that, under a general set of conditions, a history of collaboration between agents may systematically hinder their ability to work together effectively, resulting in a more contentious relationship for the principals they represent. Our empirical analyses are based on the professional histories of 21,757 lawyers (external legal counsel or agents) representing 11,206 corporate clients (principals) in 4,570 intellectual property lawsuits filed from 2000 to 2015. Embeddedness perspective predicts that a history of collaboration between opposing lawyers could provide common ground for bitter adversaries to resolve a dispute. Yet highly adversarial disputes also raise the bar for what constitutes unwavering loyalty to clients. These concerns are especially prominent for lawyers who collaborated in the past but currently represent opposing parties in litigation. During legal proceedings, these lawyers are prone to engage in aggressive compensatory behaviors to mitigate doubts about their unwavering loyalty to clients. Our study documents that such compensatory behaviors lead to longer and more contentious litigation, ultimately resulting in lost value for the clients."
2017,"The Effect of Variations in Task Assignment and Professional-Task Fit on Performance Outcomes How does the fit between professional expertise and work relate to performance? This study explores the nature of task assignment  essentially the division of labor  among professionals as setting the stage for performance outcomes. I construct an interaction model of professional-task fit to test hypotheses on performance as it relates to the professional division of labor, in particular looking at professionals with overlapping expertise: generalists and specialists. Using patient data collected at an academic childrens hospital (n = 4,638), and combining that data with a survey I administered to the generalist and specialist physicians at this field site (44 percent response rate), I explore different task assignment factors. First, how do changes in the professional in charge during the course of work affect performance outcomes? Second, how is performance impacted when the nature of the task changes during the course of work? Third, what are the performance outcomes when a generalist (specialist) should be assigned but actually is not? Results have implications for developing contingency fit theories at the meso-level, and at the practical level, implications for division of labor practices that yield high performance, particularly among professionals with potentially overlapping expertise."
2017,"Boundaryless Prestige? Contingent Value of Home-based Prestige in Cross-Border Client Relationship Research suggests that status-based market advantages occur largely because local market audiences pay much attention to prestige signalsi.e., top rankings, awards, or elite affiliationsand consider them as indicating actors superior quality in their own evaluation involved in exchange decision. Far less clear is the extent to which such benefits accrued to high-prestige actors can be replicated when they encounter non-local market audiences, those who are lacking linkages to the community from which prestige originates. In this paper, we explore this question in the context of professional services firms cross-border expansion by examining how and when home-based prestige, or esteem earned in ones native community, affects these firms success in obtaining cross-border client relationships. We argue that, although the local embeddedness of prestige judgments and conferral is likely to constrain full realization of prestige-based advantage across national boundaries, under certain circumstances some benefits of home-based prestige can occur insofar as prospective clients find it relevant and useful to resort to prestige signals of non-local origin. We test our hypotheses about those audience-candidate-specific contingencies for cross- border prestige spillovers with data on Vault Top 100 Law Firms (U.S.) and their capital market client relationships across 37 countries from 1999 to 2012 and find strong support."
2017,"No Vacancy: Professional-Client Relationships as Barriers to Jurisdictional Shifts  Two core assumptions underpin studies of professional jurisdiction: first, that whenever a profession moves up in the system of professions, someone, a different profession or an occupation, will fill the vacancy left behind; second, that clients play a somewhat passive role in the process of jurisdictional change. Our study aims at exploring these assumptions, and we do so by looking at the question of jurisdictional shifts and the conditions that make them more or less likely to succeed. Our findings are based on an ethnography of an attempted jurisdictional shift, including hundreds of professionalclient interactions. We show that clients play a central role in the process of jurisdictional shift, especially in the case of heteronomous professions, an increasingly important class of professions. By clarifying the conditions under which professional jurisdictions change, we contribute to the growing literature on the topic."
2017,Ideological Boundaries of Advantageous Network Positions in the United States Congress Extant research has demonstrated that actors position within the informal network of an organization is consequential for their performance. We enrich this view by arguing that the beneficial effects of networks are bounded by an actors ideology  the set of value laden beliefs he/she holds about how the social world operates. We test our theory using data on the legislative effectiveness of members of the House of Representatives in the United States Congress. We find that the positive effects of having a sparse network rich in structural holes and of having a high-status position on the effectiveness of a legislator are diminished if this legislator holds heterodox ideological views. Our findings both deepen and qualify current understandings of how informal networks affect actors effectiveness within organizations.
2017,"Intra-organizational Networks of Innovations In this paper we propose a complementary approach to traditional explanations of how individual network characteristics affect their ability to generate innovations. In particular, by partitioning individual networks in two mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories of ties, Simmelian vs. non- Simmelian ties, we argue for the importance of their joint consideration to explain individuals innovativeness. While both sets of ties provide conditions that are necessary for the generation of innovation, no one set alone provides conditions that are also sufficient to explain individual innovative outputs. In the context of three distinct business units in a large multinational semiconductor company we survey 253 engineers collecting data about their knowledge sharing network and their innovative productivity. Results show that over and above traditional predictors of innovativeness, the proportion of Simmelian ties they have critically affects their innovative capabilities. In particular we observe an inverse U-shaped relationship between proportion of Simmelian ties and individuals innovative output and we further observe that the upward and downward sloping of this curve becomes steeper for individuals with higher job rank. Implications for network research and practice are discussed."
2017,"Networks and Professional Deviance in the Prescription Drug Abuse Epidemic We extend the literature on social networks and wrongdoing, which has largely focused on deviance perpetrated with cognizance and intentionality, by considering deviance by omission. We propose that misconduct due to omission versus commission may arise from distinct processes and are likely to be associated with different individual characteristics and social network structures. In this study, we examine inappropriate physician prescribing by commission and omission. Although research and policies are dominated by the perspective that a few prolific physicians in corrupt pill mills are the primary drivers of prescription drug misuse, we find that physician deviance by omission, rather than commission, has a more substantial effect on the total volume of benzodiazepines prescribed. Using a longitudinal patient-sharing network comprised of 660,428 physicians linked by 12.5 million patients, we find remarkable differences in the characteristics and networks of physicians engaged in deviance by omission and commission. Taking these differences into account will improve efforts to curb prescription drug misuse by allowing for more effective targeting of educational and policy efforts aimed at reducing inappropriate prescribing."
2017,"Angry Entrepreneurs: A Note on Networks Prone to Character Assassination A great deal of attention is given to the benefits of bridging structural holes in a network, but relatively little attention is given to the costs involved in building the bridge. Here we study the risk of character assassination. Bridge relations are prone to difficulty from conflicting interests, indifference, and misunderstandings. More, bridge relations adjacent to a closed network are prone to character assassination  sympathetic gossip within the closed network encourages ego to blame bridge difficulty on the character of the person on the other side of the bridge. We propose an assassination index measuring the extent to which each of a persons relationships is a bridge adjacent to a closed network, and thus prone to difficulty and character assassination. The index does well in predicting who Chinese entrepreneurs cite as their most difficult colleague, and predicting which entrepreneurs blame the difficulty on the colleagues character (rather than the colleagues competence, or a generally difficult situation). The results provide yet another instance of similar network mechanisms operating in East and West, here illustrating one of the pathologies associated with closed networks, which are so often touted as especially valuable in the East."
2017,"Finding Novelty through Co-evolutionary Search Organizational researchers usually describe search as a sequential and deductive process, starting from a defined problem, which then unfolds toward a solution. However, when actors face truly novel strategic challenges characterized by uncertainty or ambiguity, defining a specific problem may turn out to be either impossible or unproductive. To address this challenge, we develop a co- evolutionary theory of search that draws on design thinking and an abductive logic of inquiry. Search in this model shifts from one of detection to puzzlingthat is, from identifying solutions to problems toward negotiating and matching potential problems and solutions (previously) associated with an abstract goal. We label the outcome of this puzzling process a nexusthe joint set of problem-solution pairs accepted by the members of the organization as adequately representing the abstract goal. This goal representation delineated by the nexus, defines the boundary condition for co-evolutionary search: organizational actors may then clearly define problems and solve these via sequential search. Our argument has broad implications for organization theory and strategy research as well as management practice."
2017,"In Deep Water: Negative Attainment, Attention, and IOR Formation in the Dutch Water Authority Sector Behavioral theory can be used to explain when search are triggered, yet it is silent on what directs this search and the resulting decisions. Synthesizing the behavioral theory of the firm with the attention-based view fills this gap. We theorize four moderators of the association between negative attainment discrepancy and interorganizational relationship formation: a weaker relationship when attention is on (1) internal issues, and (2) different organizations in the external environment, and a stronger relationship when the attention is on (3) interorganizational collaboration, and (4) similar organizations in the external environment. Applying topic modeling to longitudinal data from the Dutch water authority sector 2008-2014, we find that organizations are more likely to form an interorganizational relationship when performance drops below aspiration and that this effect is indeed moderated by the organizations attention to aforementioned issues. We discuss theoretical implications, in particular in extending behavioral decision theory, and phenomenological implications, in particular for research on interorganizational relationships."
2017,"Reading the Competitors Tea Leaves: Interpretation and Innovative Search in Mobile App Ecosystem This paper examines how competition affects entrepreneurial firms product experimentation search in new markets. We argue that in new markets where demand is uncertain and dynamic, competitors success does not only pose survival threat to firms, but also provide information about market opportunities. Based on behavioral decision making and interpretative frameworks, we develop assumptions about how firms perceive competitors and how they associate competitors success with market opportunities. By disentangling different dimensions of competition, we tested the behavior predictions of how different dimensions of competition affect firms search behavior measured by new product launch. The results show that in general, firms see greater number of successful competitors as a sign of a promising category, thus are more likely to increase search in that category. Having strong competitors or greater demand volatility reduces that likelihood of search. Yet the decision for more distant searchlaunch a new app in unfamiliar categoriesis slightly different. When taking the comparison of target category and initial category variables into account, we find that the firms do not care about strong competition and great demand volatility actually enhances the likelihood of distant search."
2017,"Organizational Search for New Members: The Effect of Status Loss on Exploration and Exploitation  Empirical attempts on uncovering the reasons behind organizations' endeavors on exploration vs. exploitation activities have been mostly limited to the investigation of three major factors of environmental aspects, organization's historical and structural aspects, and managerial biases and characteristics. Nevertheless, looking deeper into the current literature, we gather that all of the investigated factors somewhat constitute circumstances under which exploration or exploitation would more likely occur. Therefore, the real underlying mechanisms that trigger organizations to make a conscious decision and enhance their explorative or exploitative activities is yet to be examined. To that purpose, in this study we argue that the reasons behind organizations' choice of exploration- exploitation activities go well beyond the investigated environmental, structural, and managerial circumstances, and stretch into the cognitive state of the organization and its comparison with their past cognitive state. To that end, we examine how negative shifts is status of the organization play a crucial role in affecting the exploration-exploitation interplay."
2017,"The Outward Nature of Meaningful Work and Professional Activism in Post-Industrial Society The purpose of this paper is to explore the outward nature of meaningfulness in work in post-industrial society. I use a day-long field-based interview design to examine the callings and activism of fly fishing guides to learn about how their work serves as a vehicle to address threats relating to environmentalism and river conservation. My findings illustrate that professional fly fishing guides work as legitimate environmental architects that rebuild aquatic habitats without ecological training, author fishing regulations without legal or biological training, and enforce regulations without law enforcement training. This paper draws on a pair of insights: (1) the outward nature of callings beckons a heightened sense of responsibility, motivating professionals to act outwardly on behalf of others, even at the risk of their own safety and (2) by looking outward, individuals with minimal education, training or credentials can be viewed as having professional authority, re-emphasizing the centrality of the outward nature of work. By leveraging claims of a higher purpose, professionals can build legitimacy in ways that fall beyond certifications, degrees and specialized training. I theorize that work is, at least in part, driven by the pursuit of higher goals, expanding our understanding of the nature of work in post-industrial society."
2017,"Chasing the Next Dollar: How Portfolio Workpreneurs Survive and Thrive in Kenyas Hustling Economy  Drastic socioeconomic changes over the past decades have profoundly affected the Global North, with the result that the institution of stable, full employment  upheld by the organization man  has entered a new era that is fundamentally changing work into a world of flexible work arrangements that oftentimes run in parallel which is best captured by the image of an assiduous multi-active individual. This paper argues that a fresh view on contemporary work dynamics through an inductive qualitative study outside of well-researched contexts can provide new conceptualizations of the multidimensional work realities todays workers are exposed to. Using empirical data from Kenyas technology entrepreneurship sector and an interpretative methodological design, four interrelated work dimensions emerge: hustling, organizational work, relational work and personal finance activities. Taken together, these constitute a comprehensive interface from which the multi-active individual in Kenya engineers a comprehensive work portfolio to hedge risks in the pursuit of a steady income flow, create social welfare and pursue the possibility of exerting agency for changing the status quo in an otherwise volatile and unpredictable environment  transforming the multi-active individual into a portfolio workpreneur. The implications of this conception on the future of work, organizing and organizations are discussed."
2017,"Serving Too Many Masters: Multiple Managers and Worker Performance  Project-based work has been going through fundamental transformations in the last decades, with the emergence of fluid teams that are frequently created to accomplish short-term tasks. This new matrixed form of organization requires workers to report to multiple managers simultaneously. Contrary to the prevalent view in the literature, we argue that there is an inverted U-shaped curvilinear relationship between the number of managers and worker performance. We also argue that the costs outweigh the benefits much sooner in the presence of complex tasks and a higher proportion of managers collocated with the worker. Using timesheet data from the software maintenance unit of a multinational, Fortune 500 IT company organized in fluid project teams we empirically explore our arguments and find evidence for our hypotheses."
2017,"An Exchange Theory Of Relationships In Online Labor Markets Advances in information technology have given rise to massive online labor markets populated by millions of freelance contractors around the globe. Today, anyone with an internet connection can hire contractors from these markets for expert work. We develop a theoretical framework for understanding the nature and quality of the relationships formed between these informal client managers and online contractors. Our model integrates exchange theory with role theory and research on swift trust to explain when a client-contractor relationship is likely to be low-level, transactional, or generative. Because these relationships are formed under competitive market conditions and carried out entirely online, participants are likely to have misaligned role expectations, with negative consequences for trust. When ongoing interactions affirm or repair trust, the client and contractors may exchange desired social resources, such as mentoring, expanded role scope, and recognition for the contractor, and commitment, communication, and innovative ideas for the client. Otherwise, the relationship is likely to be low-level or transactional, with little growth for either party. Our Client-Contractor Exchange model offers a theoretical foundation for understanding the online market-based relationships proliferating in the gig economy."
2017,"Boundary Objects Survival Over Time: Insights from the Field of Healthcare Coordination In this paper we focus on why some boundary objects last more than others. We question the literature that focuses exclusively on the plasticity of the knowledge inscribed in boundary objects and propose that, to shed light on why some objects last more than others, we need to consider also the plasticity of their affordances (objects should be modifiable over time). Through qualitative and longitudinal study in the field of healthcare coordination we were able to identify a number of objects that have been used, over time, to improve exchange of medical information across providers. Our findings build on and extend the literature on boundary objects and offers a novel theorizing related to patterns of causal relationship between an objects physical characteristics, its use in practice and its ability to survive the constant emergence of new ideas and knowledge."
2017,"Objects Matter: Generating Knowledge at the Boundaries of Research and Practice Research on cross-boundary work recommends that actors from different communities engage in deep dialogue and reconcile differences in order to generate knowledge. Boundary objects are posited to afford this boundary work. Objects help actors identify differences, bridge those differences, and in the process, discover additional differences and build interdependencies. Our study, however, focused on episodic, as opposed to the sustained engagements of prior research on boundary work. In shorter interactions, actors do not have as much opportunity to engage in deep dialogue and reconcile differences, so the effectiveness of boundary objects is not clear. Hence we ask: how do boundary objects afford boundary work in episodic interactions? We answer this question inductively by observing a project between researchers and managers in which they periodically met to generate solutions to sustainability issues. We also draw on 57 interviews with researchers, managers and project managers who had participated in other similar projects. We find that these episodic interactions among the communities of research and practice were best facilitated by boundary objects that were provisional and offered a lingua franca. In this paper, we describe the interplay and importance between these two affordances."
2017,"The Reconstitution of Work Practices Following a Radical Hospital Restructuring Through this two-year ethnographic study we report on the merger and integration of two neonatal intensive care units belonging to separate hospitals into a newly built super hospital. Our field study of this transformation process offers analysis regarding the organizing challenges surfaced by the move, the adaptation to a new space with novel material arrangements, and the melding of units previously located in different hospitals. We trace how and why, as a result of sweeping changes in social and material configurations, work practices became less resilient and less performant. From this radical hospital restructuring, we offer insight on how the organizing mechanisms of existing work practices are constituted and how they are reconstituted given novel material, technological and social foundations. We find that practices have to be reconstituted when the sociality and materiality of a site of practice are dramatically altered. We develop how three essential organizing mechanisms (practice orientations, skillful performance and instrumentation configurations) provide coherence and resilience to a practice."
2017,"Reciprocal and Dynamic Affordances: Evidence from Social Technologies in the Medical Field Affordances have been proposed as a novel lens in management studies of technologies that bridges several of the dualities that have divided the field (e.g. social vs human agency). While this has directed research, and provided new insights, the concept of affordances has been diversely defined and applied leading to some inconsistencies. Furthermore, focus has been on understanding affordances related to material technologies, neglecting more social ones. By observing medical rounds in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, this manuscript clarifies the relational nature of affordances and reveals how social technologies and the social elements composing them create reciprocal affordances, a type of affordances previously unreported with respect to material technologies. Furthermore, this research highlights the highly dynamic nature of affordances by showing how the characteristics of technologies change almost constantly and how they combine to enable or inhibit affordances. These new insights inform our understanding of complex technologies and pave the way for a better analysis of sociomaterial systems."
2017,"Serving Two Masters: Role Expectation Enactment and Anticipated Careers of Service Professionals While only a small minority of professionals joining a professional service firm (PSF) make it to partnership, we know little about how the individuals themselves navigate that system in particular, how they decide to stay and pursue the partnership track, what makes them leave the firm, and whether and when these decisions may co- exist. This study adopts a role expectations enactment lens to examine the strategies that individuals engage in to manage their careers, both those who seek to make it within the firm and those who may prepare their exit. Building on in-depth interviews with 60 pre- partnership professionals in accounting, consulting, and law, we uncover four anticipated career paths  partner-track, client- track, off-track and wait-and- see  and corresponding systematic variations in the ways that professionals enact their role with respect to partners and clients. We find that individual career agency is embedded in the proximate social structures that circumscribe professionals role expectation enactment. In particular, findings highlight how partner-client portfolio constellations impinge on the ability to engage in specific forms of role enactment beyond what both the traditional PSF literature and the protean career lens would lead us to expect."
2017,"Professional Identity Transformation and Strategic Industry Change: From Ambiguity to Reconstruction In industries disrupted by technological innovation, strategic industry change may affect professional identity. This study explains the dynamic processes through which the professional identity of a collective of professionals evolves and transforms. To study such continuous transformation of a shared identity we engaged in a longitudinal qualitative study of the discursive practices of professionals in the newspaper industry. Professionals renegotiated core elements constituting their identity by converting old understandings of professional identity into new ones and by expanding understandings of professional identity by means of new elements. As such, they engaged in dynamic identity reconstruction processes allowing the reconstruction of a coherent professional identity, congruent with the strategic industry change at hand. Our study reveals the importance of recursive interrelationships between identity, cognition and strategic industry change: professional identity defines professionals cognitive interpretation of industry change, yet in parallel strategic industry change shapes professionals cognitive understanding of their identity. We contribute by highlighting the value of intertwining professional identity theory and strategic change research to better understand industry dynamics."
2017,"Why Do Extra-Long Working Hours Persist? Inertial Dynamics in a Management Consulting Firm Regimes of extra-long working hours have become widely criticized for their detrimental effects on organizations and individuals. However, most initiatives designed to change them have not had much success. Patterns of extra-long working hours prove surprisingly persistent. So far, very little is known about why this is the case. In this paper, we argue that one way to address this gap entails investigating how such regimes have evolved historically to become rigid as they are today. To do so, we draw on a longitudinal case study of the extra-long working hours regime of the elite management consulting firm Consult that spans a period of over four decades. We employ a path-dependence lens to explain both the formation and gradual rigidification of extra-long working hours at Consult. More specifically, we identify two strategy-related, self- reinforcing dynamics based on adaptive expectations and complementarity effects respectively. The paper makes three contributions: (i) it introduces strategy formation as a so-far neglected factor in time regime research, (ii) it elaborates on how organizationallevel mechanisms matter for time regime persistence, and (iii) outlines a new approach to changing persistent extra-long hours regimes. We conclude by pointing out limitations and opportunities for future research."
2017,"The Busyness Paradox: Overworked Professionals and the Timeflow of Busyness In this article, we adopt a practice perspective to conceptualize the temporal experience of professionals in service firms through the notion of timeflow  a particular temporal quality that is the effect of performing practices and which cannot be reduced to either subjective inner or universal outer time. We use this framework to explain our finding that professionals who regularly perform overwork, paradoxically, drawn to prefer busy periods over quieter ones. Drawing on 146 interviews and more than 300 weekly diaries in two professional service firms, we advance prior research on temporality in organizations by theorizing the practice of overwork entails a timeflow of busyness that is addictive. We conceptualize this busyness paradox and show professionals consciously and unconsciously sought to construct and maintain a timeflow of busyness that allowed them to cope with cycles of overwork and temporal conflict. We discuss how our practice-theoretical approach opens up new perspectives for exploring this paradox and the management of timeflows, and the negative aspects of compulsive work absorption."
2017,"In the Beginning: Proto-Networks, Audiences, and Producers During New Industry Emergence Entrepreneurship researchers now look beyond individual founders and producers to model the processes and mechanisms by which information about new social forms diffuses to broader audiences. During industry emergence, the lack of agreement about legitimate organiza-tional forms between producers and key audiences is a major challenge. To explore whether communication over network ties might fill this void, we develop an ecological model of emerging networks, which we call proto-networks, which focuses on the properties of networks with a very small numbers of actors, far smaller than those described in the existing literature. We develop a theoretical framework that includes two kinds of proto-network ties, within-group, e.g., among audiences or among producers, and bridging, e.g., between audiences and producers. Based on this model, we suggest propositions about how these ties will affect two outcomes that are essential to the emergence of new industry, the survival of producers and the growth of total industry resources. We use simulation methodology to test these propositions, finding strong support for the predictions of a proto-network model of industry emergence. We close by exploring some conclusions and implications of our model for both theory and practice."
2017,"Political, Institutional, and Economic Conditions for New Industry Emergence: Retail Clinics What conditions predict new organizational entry and growth in an emergent industry? We investigate regulatory and economic market conditions associated with new entry and integration of retail health clinicsa radically new organizational forminto the organizational field of primary care in the U.S. While prior literature examines, separately, economic, institutional, and political predictors of new industry emergence, we use fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to identify configurations of field conditions on the three dimensions simultaneously that are associated with clinics presence and growth. We find all three dimensions played a role in the initial growth of the new organizational form across U.S. states up to 2008, the industry subsequent growth from 2008 to 2013. Most important, we find that regulatory barriers of professional license, which research on professions and occupational licensure would predict to be a key hurdle for new entrants, did not matter for retail clinics proliferation, when political and economic was favorable for entry."
2017,"Creating Markets for Servitization: Exploring Qualification Processes, Devices and Agencements The aim of this study is to understand how markets for product- service combinations arising from a servitization strategy are created. There is a tendency in the literature to assume a demand for such offerings exists by default, which we find problematic. This paper attempts to explore market-creation processes through an economic sociology perspective. An in-depth exploratory empirical case study approach is adopted within a large global organization providing industrial plants and equipment. We explore how the case organization is attempting to provide a portfolio of supporting services to fully-fledged solutions while simultaneously overcoming the challenge of qualifying such new offerings. Our findings suggest that marketization of servitized offerings is a process that companies can actively drive in order to help qualify the value of those offerings. This process is usefully understood through concepts such as frames, overflows, devices and agencements. In applying such concepts, it is possible to show how market creation processes unfold, both internally and externally of an organization, and how they may be leveraged to qualify servitized offerings."
2017,"Shaping the Rules of Engagement: Discursive Corporate Political Strategies in Nascent Markets We explore how strategic actors in a nascent market shape the competitive regulation of the market in their favor. Our qualitative longitudinal study follows the competing discursive strategies of entrepreneurial Electric Vehicle Service Providers (EVSPs) and established Investor Owned Utilities (IOUs) in California, as they sought to influence three sequential decisions by a regulatory agency to shape the competitive structure of the nascent electric vehicle (EV) charging market. We find that actors seek to influence market regulation through a confluence of three distinct yet mutually enabling discursive strategies: framing the shared environment, constructing a problem of competition, and situating regulation in time, which respectively seek to construct shared meanings, shape the attention and priorities of the regulatory agency, and appeal to the procedural legitimacy of the regulatory agency. The core output of our study is a framework of discursive corporate political strategies for shaping regulation over time in nascent markets."
2017,"The Effect of Performance Feedback on the Exploration and Exploitation Tradeoff March (1991) concluded that when organizations seek to balance exploration and exploitation, the choice is primarily driven by learning from performance feedback. This research tests this conclusion of March at the aggregate organizational level. We examine the impact of the performance feedback using textual analysis of quarterly earnings releases. Unexpectedly, we find that better performance is related to a subsequent increase in exploration relative to exploitation. Since prospect theory is based on individual risk-taking, our findings suggest different mechanisms of risk-taking as a response to performance feedback at the aggregate, organizational level. Our research highlights the performance feedback process at the aggregate organizational level as a determinant of the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation."
2017,"Performance Feedback and the Cognition of Entrepreneurial Firms The research on performance feedback explains how organizations react to a discrepancy between aspiration and performance. It offers two distinct explanations for firm performance below aspiration. While some firms pursue problemistic search, others experience threat- rigidity. In this study we argue that threat-rigidity behavior can not only exacerbate, it can also be turned into problemistic search. Using a longitudinal sample of 395 entrepreneurial firms in the music retail industry, we found that the firms that underwent a change in CEO turned threat- rigidity into problemistic search. However, the firms that widened their product portfolio in the face of threat-rigidity behavior experienced stronger rigidity effects. Our study highlights the role of organizational cognition in integrating divergent responses to performance below aspiration. We show that cognitive overload can limit the capacity for change, but mechanisms that help retrigger organizational cognition can provide an avenue for higher growth and risk taking."
2017,"Expanding Performance Feedback Theory to Temporary Organizations Temporary organizationssuch as projectsare increasingly relevant, yet organization theory on temporary organizations remains incomplete. In particular, we have little understanding of when and how temporary organizations change. Performance feedback theory, the behavioral theory of the firms cornerstone to explain change in organizations, provides a promising platform to address this problem. We bring together ideas on goal- based aspiration levels, time pressure, and vicarious learning to expand performance feedback theory to temporary organizations. Specifically, we theorize and test how time pressure and vicarious learning affect aspiration- level induced change in temporary organizations. We test our theory using a unique longitudinal dataset on 575 fundraising projects (7,752 observations) published on Kickstarter. Our results largely confirm our theorizing, demonstrating that performance below the aspiration level (i.e. negative performance feedback) has a non-linear effect on the change of narratives, which is attenuated by time pressure. Furthermore, performance below the aspiration level benefits vicarious learning of complex and general narratives from best-performing peers, a result that parallels temporary organizations and non-temporary organizations. We discuss implications for theory and research on performance feedback theory and temporary organizations."
2017,"Whats Black, White, and Read All Over? Media Coverage of Serious Organizational Errors as 'News' In this paper, we study what constitutes a 'newsworthy event.' That is, we investigate which errors by firms are deemed sufficiently serious to warrant coverage in major business daily newspapers. We argue that media determination of an error as 'news' is due as much to perceptions of the actor who commits it as to the errors underlying characteristics. Specifically, we theorize that the media categorizes firms as either 'sinners' or 'saints' and that this filter affects the decision to report, holding the magnitude of the error constant. We test this theory in the context of major oil spills in the U.S., defined as an amount greater than 50 barrels (approximately 2,000 gallons), from 1985 to 2016--a period during which 1,125 of these serious errors occurred. Results support our theory that, while larger spills are more likely to be covered, spills committed by saints are more likely to warrant coverage than similar spills committed by sinners. Rather than a free pass, we suggest positive perceptions cause the media to hold a firm to a higher standard, increasing the chance an error will be perceived as 'serious,' and thus newsworthy. These main effects are moderated by the firms prior media coverage. Implications for theory about the effects of serious errors are discussed."
2017,"Academic Research Echoes in the Media: The Effect of Research Quality and Public Resonance This study aims to explore how the tension between research quality and public resonance helps to explain which academic publications get coverage in the news. When academics push out their research to the media, it is unclear why certain press releases lead to coverage in news outlets while others are not picked up at all. On the one hand, research quality  as signalled by the journal impact factor  may increase the likelihood that research captures journalists attention. On the other hand, journalists have an incentive to write about research that resonates with the publics interests. However, high journal quality and high public resonance need not go together, which raises the question under what circumstances research can still generate media attention despite being published in lower impact journals. This study identifies various dimensions of public resonance and assesses how these dimensions may strengthen or weaken the importance of research quality as a signal. Analysing the media attention of academics in a major research-intensive university, this study finds that there is a substitution effect between the signal of research quality and the unexpectedness of the research content, and a complementarity effect between the research quality signal and contribution relevance of the research in explaining the media attention of academic articles."
2017,"Flowin with the Wind: The Influence of Media Reputation on Employee Movements between Organizations In this study, we examine the relationship between media reputation and employee turnover. We specifically shed light on when and why the absolute level of reputation and reputational differences between organizations account for employee flows within a population of organizations. Using comprehensive data from English hospitals, we find that: (1) the level of reputation is negatively related to staff turnover, (2) surprisingly, employees tend to move from more to less reputable organizations, (3) highly skilled employees are the most mobile employee group, and (4) both local as well as national media coverage play an important role in employees turnover decisions, but influence the direction of employee flows differently. These findings extend research on social evaluations and collective turnover in important ways."
2017,"The Diffusion and Consequences of Coordinated Impression Management Support among Minority Leaders In this study we examine a social mechanism by which female and racial minority CEOs have counteracted important forms of social discrimination in firm leadership. In particular, we examine the diffusion, organization, and consequences of minority support groups or MSGs, which are informal groups of minority CEOs that help each other manage their reputations as leaders by engaging in coordinated impression management in communications with journalists. The first part of our theoretical framework draws from theory and research on social exchange and collective action to explain how generalized reciprocity facilitated the diffusion of MSGs across industries. We then draw further from social exchange theory in explaining the social organization of MSGs. We suggest that the prevailing approach to organizing the provision of support in these groups represents a distinct form of generalized social exchange, which we describe as need-based, net generalized reciprocity. The last part of our framework draws from the social psychology of persuasion to explain why coordinated impression management by members of MSGs is likely to be especially influential with journalists, in comparison to the uncoordinated support by individual leaders examined in prior research."
2017,"Endogenous Network Effects in Multiplex Interorganizational Relationships: Critical Review This paper reviews articles that address the interplay between two or more types of interorganizational ties published in the top management and sociology journals. I first summarize the empirical findings on how different forms of ties  for example, alliances, board interlocks, or employee connections  influence each other. The observed tie-to-tie effects are then classified on two criteria: first, whether the antecedent affects the outcome positively or negatively, and second, whether the outcome tie is formed with the same partner as the antecedent tie. This classification suggests four endogenous network effects: embeddedness, redundancy, complementarity, and incompatibility. I examine assumptions scholars make about firm motives that drive connections between individual organizations and how each of the four structural effects relate to the assumed firm motives. Conclusion discusses the current state of knowledge on mutual influence between multiplex interfirm ties and outlines the directions for future research."
2017,"The Effects of Multiplex Social Ties on the Costs of Inter-Firm Resource Acquisition Researchers have widely evidenced the value of inter-organizational multiplex ties. However, multiplex ties are costly to form and maintain. While well-endowed firms may be able to incur costs, under-resourced organizations may not. Consequently, the same organizations that would most benefit from inter-firm multiplex ties face the relatively steepest costs. Given a rich-get-richer effect, what can under- resourced organizations do? In this paper, I focus on the costs of multiplex ties in one type of persistently under-resourced organization: low-income primary schools. I conduct a multi-methods study involving both interview (N = 52) and survey (N = 559) data on network ties between nine schools and their external partners. From the qualitative study, I theorize a distinction between social multiplexity and resource multiplexity important for understanding the cost of multiplex ties. I hypothesize greater resource multiplexity is associated with greater costs of resource acquisition, but greater social multiplexity lessens this effect. Specifically, I draw on the qualitative data to theorize three mechanisms through which social multiplexity lessens costs of multiplex resource ties: (1) resource sharing coordination, (2) resource awareness, and (3) resource acquisition completeness. Using the survey data, I find quantitative support for my hypotheses. The result is an emerging theory of multiplex resource acquisition, which reframes costs of external ties as a function of the interaction between resource and social multiplexity. The study has implications for research on resource flow in social networks, organizational embeddedness, and under-resourced organizations."
2017,"Rarely Seen Wormholes Contract Global Social Networks We report the discovery of high bandwidth bridge ties (or wormholes) in population-scale social networks. Social ties that bridge between clusters are widely assumed to be relatively rare and to connect acquaintances whose interactions are sporadic and emotionally distant, but researchers have lacked the global network data needed to verify the predicted weakness. Using data for 56M Twitter users from eight culturally and economically diverse countries, supplemented with nationwide telephone data, we confirmed the predicted scarcity of long bridge ties but not their weakness. Instead, these social wormholes are far stronger in some cases than embedded ties with a friend in common, thereby contracting extreme network distances, with important implications for social integration and the rapid diffusion of persuasive communications that require strong social bonds."
2017,"From Affect to Instrumentality: The Dynamics of Values Homophily in Professional Networks Value homophily is the idea that relationships are more rewarding and more common between people with more similar values, because shared values produce affective rewards. It is a bedrock concept in the literature on interpersonal networks, yet there is almost no direct evidence for it because values are hard to measure directly. Moreover, there is uncertainty as to how value homophily will manifest itself in professional networks, where affective concerns are counter-balanced by the increased salience and importance of instrumental concerns. We apply an original method for operationalizing individual values to study the role of value similarity in the dynamics of professional networks among working professionals studying part-time for an MBA. We find that value similarity has a massive impact on the formation of professional network relationships, but is much less important in predicting whether those relationships endure. We see these results as emerging from processes where professional networkers seek instrumental benefits, while trying to maintain relational integrity by respecting affective concerns, represented by values."
2017,"Revisiting Total Institutions: Organizing Refugee Camps I report on an in-depth case study of the Dadaab refugee camp in Kenya to explain how refugee camp organizations maintain social stability when refugees spend decades in them, deprived of the freedom to move or work. Analysis finds that refugee camps are characterized by a parallel organizational structure in which the institutional worlds of (primarily Western) camp managers and (primarily Somali in this case) refugees coexist. Mutual dependence between camp managers and refugees creates respected spaces marked by reciprocal tolerance and minimal intrusion between their institutional worlds. Drawing on Goffman, I theorize a sixth type of total institution exemplified by the refugee camp and elaborate on the mechanisms for effective organizing across organizational divisions under conditions of mutual dependence."
2017,"Resourcing for Inclusion of Marginalized Actors in Transnational Governance Members of many communities around the world work daily to become active participants in changing or building transnational regulations, despite limited access to the resources commonly required for engagement in these processes. The research question at the center of this study is: how marginalized actors work to get included in transnational governance? This issue was examined in the context of the construction of a new regulation in the United Nations, the legally-binding Nagoya Protocol designed to regulate access and benefit-sharing (ABS) initiatives in the context of biodiversity-based innovation. This study focuses on indigenous peoples - non-state actors who historically have been excluded from policy-making processes and are in a disadvantaged position for contributing to the shaping of this new institution. This research project adopts a qualitative, inductive and longitudinal research strategy in a multi-event ethnography. The main finding highlights the emergence of the mechanism resourcing, composed of three different types of resourcing: organizational, discursive and material. Building on this finding, the paper elaborates a grounded model for inclusion in transnational regulation creation that illustrates the continuous interplay among negotiation spaces, positions and resourcing. This paper contributes to the literature by illuminating the practices behind inclusion of marginalized actors involved in transnational governance."
2017,"Field Configuration in Complex Transnational Fields: Developing a Response Strategy to HIV/AIDS This paper presents the inductive findings of a 2-year field study documenting the formation of the PACT for Social Transformation, a meta-organizational coalition of 15 geographically dispersed youth- serving NGOs brought together by the United Nations as a means to intensify efforts in the global response to HIV/AIDS. Positioning the democratization and opening of strategy formulation as an essential field configuring event, we document the process through which disparate actors were able to overcome conflicting meaning systems and logics to converge on a meta-level strategic frame. We identify three underlying process mechanisms: (1) reflection; (2) reflexion and; (3) abstraction, that trigger shifts in patterns of sensemaking to allow actors in complex transnational fields to come together and coconstruct a shared strategic frame. Our findings provide important new insights for institutional theory."
2017,"Are All Children Created Equal? Child Gender,Childcare and Female Labor Force Participation in India Reconciling the competing demands of work and family life remains a persistent challenge for workers in the United States and around the world. Yet, this burden is not shared equally. Women bear heavier loads than men in terms of family responsibilities, including caregiving and housework, which can limit their labor force participation. In this article, we use a quasi-experimental research design to gain causal empirical traction on how a supportive work-family policy intervention  employer-sponsored childcare  affects womens labor force participation in India. We further explore heterogeneity in this effect by the gender of a womans child and probe the mechanisms that may drive this variation. Our results indicate a strong, positive effect of childcare access on womens attendance at work and that these effects are stronger among women with girls than among women with boys. Together, these findings hold theoretical insights for the understanding of gender inequality and work-family policy, while providing novel evidence about an intervention that can bolster economic security and reduce poverty in the Global South by sustaining womens employment."
2017,"Organizational Time Whereas the evolution of organizations through time has received ample attention in longitudinal studies, the on-going construction of their pasts and futures is a relatively recent preoccupation among scholars. Yet, such a view is important for better understanding how actors time construction affects  and is affected by  organizational practices and processes. Our review of current literature on time and organization suggests that it is moving from a dominantly objective, continuous, singular, periodic and structured conception of time towards subjective, event-based, on-going, multiple and enacted conceptions of time. A common denominator of the five dimensions is a move towards greater temporal agency. Building on these five dimensions we propose how they can be synthesized into a novel theoretical framework of organizational time that accounts for temporal agency. The framework embodies three mutually constitutive conceptual elements: Temporal trajectories, events and temporal work. A distinguishing feature of the framework is that it addresses the present- past-future dynamics, while explaining how their mutual dynamics unfold in relation to near and distant futures and pasts. The paper then suggests how these dynamics are enacted in relation to five different time orientations that may be found with organizations, including suggestions for future research."
2017,"Temporality in Community Logic. A Multinational Enterprise and a Rural Village in Finland We present an extreme case of a local milieu where the traditional, locally bounded values of a rural village have guided the daily operations and strategies of a multinational company for over 45 years. We investigate how and why such locally encoded decisions emerged and became prioritized and reproduced. Drawing on the institutional logics, - more specifically community logic - perspective as theoretical framework, we found that the embeddedness in both past- and present-oriented senses of connectedness, purpose, and meaning motivated the strategic reproduction of the community logic. Our study contributes to the institutional logics literature by beginning to unpack the temporal mechanisms of how agency embedded in community logic reproduces it. Second, our study contributes to the institutional logics perspective by elaborating the interaction and the extent of the influence of material (i.e. regulative and socio-normative) and symbolic (i.e. culture- cognitive) elements in varying institutional orders."
2017,"Exploring Materialization of Institutional Logics: A Case of Changing Tax Regimes and Procedures Organization studies scholars have employed the notion of institutional logics to produce a more comprehensive understanding of institutional change processes and outcomes. Their focus has been on showing institutional logics matter. However, the research that focuses on the distinctive role of materiality in institutional logic change process is relatively rare. We focus on this material aspect of institutional logic change through a qualitative interpretive case study of two attempts at introducing taxation regime changes in the same organizational environment. Our findings show that the material aspects also play salient role in the anchoring collective identities and making practices tangible, as constitutive components of institutional logics and that this role is as important as the symbolic facets. Specifically, we found that, a new institutional logic becomes sustained when the symbolic and material aspects of identities and practices reinforce each other in virtuous manner during the change process. We contribute to the institutional logics literature by: (a) elaborating a more precise approach to how the material aspects of institutional logics are manifested; (b) specifying the distinctive role for materiality in instantiating an institutional logic concretely and otherwise making it tangible via-a-vis identities and practices; and (c) proposing a materializing process for institutional logic change which includes mutual reinforcement of the symbolic and the material aspects vis--vis identities and practices as well as confluence of critical events that aid in the enactment of identity and practice changes."
2017,"Transiting into Service-Dominant Logic through Service Design:the Institutional Logics Perspective There is growing academic and managerial interest in service design (SD) with respect to both the creation of new offerings and the development of a firms strategic capability for innovation. Drawing on rich data collected in one of the worlds major telecommunication companies that undertook a series of SD initiatives, we demonstrate that the introduction of SD has far-reaching consequences for an organization. Essentially, SD principles and tools disrupt the organizational logic through the transformation of symbolic constructions and material practices. Arguing that SD is an instantiation of service-dominant logic (SDL), we suggest that the introduction of SD may be an instrument to institutionalize SDL in organizations. Building on the institutional logics perspective and acknowledging the role of individuals, we identify macro-level and micro-level mechanisms of change in the dominant logic. Our findings reveal that the transformation of the logics symbolic dimension relies on a top-down mechanism and precedes alterations to the material dimension, which, in turn, depend on a bottom-up mechanism. The strongest driver of change in both dimensions is organizational members intentions and personal revelations that play the role of an integrative mechanism that bridges the top-down and bottom-up mechanisms."
2017,"Its All about Timing: Toward a Relational Understanding of Time in Routine Performance The present paper examines the role of time in routine performance. We argue that time is a central actor shaping the dynamics of organizational routines, whilst at the same time, time only becomes constituted in relation to routines. Emerging research on temporal structuring has pointed to the active role of people in shaping time, whereas research on routine dynamics explores how routines unfold over time. Yet little is known how actors build on routines for shaping time and how time shapes the dynamics of routines on a micro-level. Drawing on an ethnographic study conducted at a firefighting unit operating in an urban environment, we elaborate on how routine participants actively make time by enacting specific routines and how time drives the pace and rhythm of routines. Building on an newly developed method that allows us to plot event time in relation to clock time, we find that actors enact specific routines for slowing down or speeding up the pace of routine performances whilst specific triggers mediate the switch between a fast or slow pace of routines. Thereby actors enact time and shape how they actually experience time. Our study contributes to the understanding of time and routines in three main areas: we introduce the concept of rhythm and pace of routines (temporal structure of patterning work), we conceptualize how time is translated within and through routines (the temporality of routines) and we argue that time only becomes meaningful within and through its enactment in routine performances."
2017,"When Flexibility is not an Option: Play as an Antidote to Strong Controls on Routine Performance Recent research has brought agency back to the study of routines promoting a view of routines as inherently flexible and improvisational. This has been an immensely useful corrective to static conceptualizations of routines that prevailed in the literature in the past. However, work contexts may impose strong controls over routine performance, constraining significantly participants agency in bringing about flexibility and change in routines. More importantly, prolonged enforcement of such controls may result in the deterioration of participants psychological wellbeing. How routine participants may respond to such deterioration has received limited attention by scholarly work in the field. By synthesizing and building upon psychological, routine, and play research we propose a process model according to which routine participants may respond by crafting playful patterned responses, which we term anti-routines. We identify the conditions promoting the emergence of anti-routines and explore the nuances of the routine  anti-routine symbiotic relationship. Our work contributes to our understanding of the influence of highly controlling contexts on the internal dynamics of routines and identifies a hitherto unexamined mechanism (anti-routines) that influences the dynamics of stability and change in routines."
2017,"Transactive Memory Systems and Innovation: The Moderating Influence of Team Conflict In field research of 202 teams participating in the worlds largest game jam, we advance the literature on transactive memory systems by developing theory regarding an important boundary condition: team conflict. Transactive memory systems provide teams both a structure and processes that enable team members to specialize, effectively coordinate, and trust each others expertise. However, when innovating, teams must not only work efficiently and effectively together, they must also generate and capitalize on new ideas. We develop novel theory as to the importance of conflict on the relationship between a teams transactive memory system and their innovativeness. Specifically, we argue that task conflict engenders the exchange of divergent ideas that are harnessed when a team has a well-developed transactive memory system but that relationship conflict deteriorates the benefits of a well-developed transactive memory system. In support of our hypotheses, our analyses show that the positive influence of a teams transactive memory system on its innovativeness is positively moderated by task conflict and negatively moderated by relationship conflict. These results further suggest that the benefits of a transactive memory system may be limited to when ideas are freely exchanged and when personal differences can be put aside."
2017,"War and Peace: How Task and Interpersonal Conflict Shapes Creative Projects and Routines This study explores the causal relationship between conflict and actions taken by teams to accomplish their tasks. We differentiated between two different forms of action trajectories, (1) routines and (2) creative projects, and relied on a laboratory experiment with a 2 (task conflict: yes vs. no)  2 (interpersonal conflict: yes vs. no) factorial design to test how task and interpersonal conflicts shape action trajectories from routines to creative projects, and vice versa. Teams repeatedly solved recurring challenges in the open world computer game Minecraft. In between, we stimulated (1) task conflict by instructing teams to discuss their actions following a conflictual devils advocacy approach, and (2) interpersonal conflict, by preparing teams for a conflictual negotiation. We found that both task and interpersonal conflict led to more creative projects. Additionally, we observed a negative interaction effect between both forms of conflict, which related to an opposed shift of action trajectories towards routines. We conclude that task and interpersonal conflicts might have favorable effects because they enable organizations to break out of routines and to enact creative projects. Our findings provide a better understanding of conflict as a driver of organizational change and innovation and contribute to a better understanding of routine and non- routine forms of organizing."
2017,"The Combined Roles of Team Leadership and Performance Evaluations in Creative Teams In this paper we analyze the joint effect of transformational team leadership and performance evaluations based on pre-set measures (objective performance evaluations, OPE) in generating creative team performance. In explaining this effect, we argue for a key role of team potency, i.e. the belief of team members in the teams collective capabilities for being successful. We propose that the effect of OPE on team potency (which itself is considered a main driver of creative performance) depends on whether OPE is combined with a transformational leadership style or not. While the team leaders use of OPE has a negative main effect on team potency, this negative effect is offset when the team leader exhibits a transformational leadership style. We test the proposed model with data collected from 101 teams and 372 individuals in 53 marketing agencies."
2017,"Communist Ideological Imprinting and Internationalization: A Study of Chinese Entrepreneurs We explore how entrepreneurs imprint their organizations, proposing that their imprint serves as an information filter that in turn affects their decision-making and shapes their firms strategy. Furthermore, we examine how different types of information diffusion and closure lead to decay and persistence of the imprint and that the rate of imprint decay increases with the credibility of the information source. Empirical investigation of a unique longitudinal dataset of Chinese private entrepreneurs from 1993-2012 supports our hypotheses, showing that entrepreneurs communist ideological imprint affects the internationalization of their firms and that a variety of information from the government and different types of information closure affect this relationship. These findings corroborate that there is significant incremental value of examining individuals ideological imprint in addition to their current ideology in shaping corporate elites decision- making processes. Our study contributes to understanding imprints and their evolution, the political ideology of upper echelons, and internationalization of Chinese firms."
2017,"Social Entrepreneurship and Its Impact: Effect of Rationalization and Legitimacy on Perceived Impact The core assumption behind the social entrepreneurship model is that the integration of social objectives and rationalized business practices can enhance social enterprises capacity to achieve their mission. While social entrepreneurship is gaining in popularity and practice, there is limited research on whether this core assumption is valid. By taking social efficacy as the outcome measure, this study examines how the rationalization of internal processes and external legitimacy affect entrepreneurs perception of efficacy. The findings show that rationalized business practices do enhance entrepreneurs perception of social efficacy, and the effect is substantially moderated by their social legitimacy."
2017,"Cultivating Detroit: Mobilizing good food entrepreneurs Organizations play a critical role in promoting social movement goals through the market; yet, there is a lack of understanding about the processes by which organizations mobilize entrepreneurs to create change. Our paper examines how an organization at the intersection of a movement and market, FoodLab, fostered the development of a good food market infrastructure in Detroit. Using a 20-month qualitative field study, we investigated the local processes by which FoodLab mobilized entrepreneurs to create market change, while addressing the challenges of motivating members, who could be in competition, to cooperate and adopt movement-driven business models. We found that FoodLab connected two central concepts in framing the movement to entrepreneurs: sense of place and livelihood. FoodLab leveraged this collective action frame to align collective identity and individual entrepreneurial identities, allowing entrepreneurs to see how their individual business goals may be realized through the movement. Further, FoodLab used education and social networks to help entrepreneurs acquire knowledge and resources to operate their businesses in line with movement goals. FoodLabs resulting legitimacy and capacity enabled the organization to shape production systems, the supply chain, and local policy. Finally, our study sheds light on the value of mobilizing participants towards an imagined future, rather than against a powerful incumbent."
2017,"Gendering Entrepreneurship Enhancing Space This paper contributes to research on gendering of organizational spaces by analyzing the gendering of space and spacing of gender through the novel concept of assemblage. Assemblage highlights the connecting, dismantling, modifying and reconnecting of heterogeneous elements to gain agency. The study is based on an ethnographic study of Helsinki Think Company, the creative entrepreneurship enhancing space of the University of Helsinki. The study analyzed how space and gender emerge in and through the assembling and reassembling of the widely used practice of using inspirational speakers to promote entrepreneurship. The study argues that the popular way of assembling the practice is inherently masculine in nature. The study shows, however, that by modifying and reassembling the sociomaterial elements of the practice a feminine space emerges where fluid gender performances are appreciated while dominant masculinity performance are discouraged. The study, thus, contributes the literature by highlighting the reproductive and well as subversive potential of assemblages in the production of space and gender that has previously gone unnoticed. It further encourages practitioners as well as academics to consider the unintended gender implications of spatial design and practices."
2017,"Performance Feedback, Shareholder Influence and Direction of Change The Behavioral Theory of the Firm has proven extremely useful in explaining when organizations search for and adopt behavioral changes. While this research has convincingly shown how negative performance feedback affects whether and when firms change, it provides little insight into the direction of organizational change and how the direction of change may be influenced by a firms shareholders. By drawing on insights from corporate governance and decision risk research, we examine how poor firm performance influences the direction of change and how the concentration of a firms dedicated and transient shareholders influence this relationship. We analyze data on the exploratory versus exploitative nature of 10,261 corporate venture capital (CVC) investments made by 348 companies during 1993-2013. We find that poor firm performance motivates firms to increase their CVC investment intensity and that this change is directed at exploitative investments. We also find that as the concentration of dedicated ownership in a poor performing firm increases, the firm alters its search trajectory by exploring more and exploiting less. This study contributes to research on the behavioral theory of the firm and CVC by showing how the direction of organizational change, as indicated by where firms invest CVC, in response to negative performance feedback is influenced by the concentration of dedicated ownership."
2017,"The Effects of Performance Feedback, Past Temporal Orientation, and Interaction on R&D; Intensity Although the performance feedback model is a theory of organizational decision making conditional on a firms comparison of its performance with aspirations, the literature has neglected the role of decision makers cognitive traits in moderating the relationship. By drawing attention on a specific type of individual cognitive traits, past temporal orientation, this study attempts to integrate the performance feedback model with managerial cognition research. Content analysis on managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation (MD&A;) sections in form 10-K annual reports of the firms in the U.S. semiconductor industry revealed that managements past temporal orientation not only directly decreases firms R&D; intensity, but also weakens the negative effect of performance-aspiration discrepancy on R&D; search."
2017,"Divest or Keep a Foreign Subsidiary? The Roles of Learning from Performance Feedback This study extends performance feedback theory and examines multinational enterprises (MNE) decision-making regarding foreign divestments. Distinct from prior behavioral research, I examine the interaction between two causally related goals (parent profitability and sales goals). I challenge the applicability of the well-established sequential attention rule to such a goal relationship, and propose a new parallel, complementary-driven mechanism for how decision makers allocate their attention between goals. When decision makers perform a causal analysis during problemistic search resulting from poor performance in parent profitability, poor performance of a parent sales goal (a sub-goal of parent profitability) catches decision makers attention and is interpreted as a cause of poor parent profitability. Given that prior research suggests that solutions usually address the causes of problems, I argue that a parent sales goal is activated when the parent profitability goal is below the aspiration level in such a case, which is contrary to what the sequential- attention rule predicts. As foreign divestment may impede the MNE from achieving sales growth, the preference for foreign divestment as a solution to profitability problems may fall. In addition, I examine the interaction between learning from performance feedback and experiential learning from subsidiary operations."
2017,"Performance Feedback and Alliance Formation in the Emerging Market: The Influence of Social Norm Prior research on performance feedback and search have posited a universal model and have been limited to addressing the possible influence of external factors. Extending performance feedback literature on this gap, we theorize that problemistic search induced by negative performance feedback will be repressed when social norms such as face(mianzi) are prevalent in the environment. Using data from firms in China from 2001 to 2011, we examine the effect of external environment on performance feedback and alliance formation. Our findings support the idea that social norms such as face repress search, and show that technological uncertainty reinforces the repression effect when performance is the below aspiration level as well as slack-driven search when performance is above the aspiration level. The results suggest the need for the behavioral theory of the firm to incorporate external factors."
2017,"Audience to Evaluator: The Effect of Social Influence in Evaluation Processes A primary goal of evaluation processes is to triangulate on the expected quality of a given candidate, good, or service (offering). Although anecdotal evidence suggests that evaluators are a small proportion of the larger audience who could have opted to rate an offering, the ratings that these evaluators produce significantly impact an offerings success. It is less clear, however, whether social influence, or the exposure to the average rating from previous evaluators, biases the evaluation process. Specifically, I examine how ratings from previous evaluators affect the likelihood that audience members evaluate an offering and bias the observed rating. I then unpack the heterogeneous effects of social influence, focusing on audience members achieved status and demonstrated expertise. To do so, I use unique data from an organization that provides a knowledge sharing platform for investment professionals. These data allow me to identify not only who rated a recommendation but also all members of the audience who could have submitted a rating. Further, I am able to leverage a natural experiment, particularly whether an audience member was exposed to the average ratings from previous evaluators at the time they opted whether to rate a recommendation, to causally identify the effect of social influence."
2017,"How Social Movement Organizations Influence Awareness of Certifications for Market Emergence  Social movement organizations are increasingly using certifications as a means to create market opportunities for products and services that align with social movement goals. For a certification to deliver on its potential as a signal that producers use to differentiate and consumers demand, large numbers of actors first need to be aware that the certification exists. This study examines the mobilizing activities used by social movement organizations to influence public awareness in the form of local media coverage. I develop and test arguments in a quantitative case study of a certification for environmentally-friendly buildings in the U.S."
2017,"Responding to the Threat of Reputation Loss: Inaccurate Self-Reporting in US Nursing Homes Because third-party evaluation systems, such as ratings and rankings, increasingly serve as a basis for firms reputations, organizations pay a great deal of attention to ensuring that they perform well according to such evaluation systems. However, while such systems are intended to incentivize firms to improve in a variety of substantive areas, firms may instead opt to bolster their standing by engaging in various forms of gaming the system. In cases where third-party evaluators rely on the organizations being assessed to self-report the data that form the basis for their rating/ranking, gaming may include providing false or misleading information. Relatively little work has investigated the conditions under which this is likely to occur. In this paper, we theorize factors that cause rated firms to vary in the reputational incentives they face, leading to differences in the likelihood of reporting false or misleading data. We test our predictions in the context of the U.S. nursing home industry, finding that not-for- profit firms, those with better previous reputations and those facing greater localized competition are more likely to report misleading data. We discuss implications for both consumers and designers of ratings."
2017,"How Do I Get on that List: Theory and Evidence on Relationship Qualitys Influence on CEO Rankings We focus on quality of exchange relationships as an influential and previously unexplored determinant of actors positions in social rankings. We propose that if evaluators who rank actors also have an exchange relationship with those actors (a frequent occurrence), then the quality of that relationship will affect how actors are ranked (over and above other factors such as performance outcomes). We specifically argue that causal attribution and reciprocity mechanisms will lead consistent fulfillment, accuracy, and consensus regarding expectations within relationships to enhance actors rankings. Evidence from an empirical study of CEO rankings within large U.S. firms generally supports these predictions."
2017,"Symbolic but Consequential: Securities Analysts Forecasts and Corporate Downsizing Decisions Organizational scholars have recently drawn our attention to a shift from an internal organizational to an external market orientation among U.S. firms in their dominant mode of workforce management. This paper contributes to the literature by demonstrating a mechanism of financial market control of corporate employment decisions, using the case of workforce downsizing since the 1980s. Building on resource dependence theory, we propose a mechanism of financial market control through the role of securities analysts. Furthermore, building on political theories of the firm, we explain how market-driven downsizing is promoted or resisted by different interest groups within and outside of the firm. Our event history analysis of downsizing announcements shows that firms engage in downsizing after missing quarterly earnings estimates of analysts. Our analysis also shows that the effect of earnings pressure is contingent on the power of competing interest groups, including investors, analysts, finance executives, and labor unions. Nevertheless, market-driven downsizing widespread over time, suggesting its legitimization as a means to manage earnings pressure from investors and analysts. We conclude by discussing theoretical implications of our findings for the research on external control of the firm, financialization, and organizational explanations of the changing nature of employment relations."
2017,"Use of Framing to Mitigate Negative Market Reactions to Acquisitions Although acquisitions are commonly used by firms to enhance competitiveness, investors generally react negatively to acquisition announcements. While recent research shows that managers frequently use impression management techniques to mitigate these negative effects, and that investors seek to gain insight into managers more informed assessments of acquisitions, we know little about whether impression management can be employed by strategically framing acquisition announcements, the primary means for managers to communicate with investors. In this paper, we address this issue and examine whether and to what extent framing of acquisition announcements influences investor reactions. Our findings show that emphasizing future revenue and market share growth in acquisition announcements is associated with more positive investor responses. We also explore contextual factors influencing the efficacy of framing, and find that framing becomes more effective in environments with high levels of uncertainty and low levels of acquisition activity."
2017,"A Configurational Approach to Identification and Employee Retention after an Acquisition Event Retaining employees is a critical predictor of success or failure in many post- acquisition integration projects. Social identification strongly affects employees intentions to remain with or leave a firm after an acquisition. In the last years, a strong understanding developed that specifically identification with the organization affects an employees intention to leave or to stay within the new organization. This article suggests that organizational identification alone is not sufficient to bring employees to stay. We employ a social identity perspective to exploratively study combinations of conditions that need to be in place alongside organizational identification for employees to develop a strong intention to leave or to stay after an acquisition. Building on a mixed method approach combining fuzzy-set methodology (fsQCA) with qualitative data, our analysis shows a nuanced picture of how multi-focus identification patterns influence employee retention. The paper highlights the configurations of conditions that need to be present for identification to transfer into behavior and shows that the combinations that lead to strong commitment to stay are substantially different from those that lead to strong intention to leave. Based on these insights, we advance theory on contingency conditions for the identification-retention relationship from a social identity perspective."
2017,"Employee Engagement in Acquisition Integration: Who Cooperates and Does It Pay? Acquisition integration requires emergent cooperation between individuals of two firms in order to combine and transfer resources. In this paper, we make use of social network analysis to study the influence of intra-firm network positions on individuals engagement in cooperations with the acquisition partner and analyze the effects of such behavior. We find that integration is mainly promoted by highly central as well as highly peripheral individuals in their intra-firm networks as well as by employees hired after the acquisition, indistinctive of their network position. When studying the benefits of integration driving cooperation, we found evidence for effects of preferential attachment and that overall rather non- cooperative behavior ensured revenue increases. Our results point towards the importance of opportunity-driven behavior when networks merge and nuance the notion of value leakage associated with acquisition integration, by suggesting that non-cooperative behavior can help compensate integration- related costs."
2017,"Whips, Chains and Books on Campus: How Organizations Legitimate Their Stigmatized Practices This paper explores how emergent organizations with core stigma and taboo practices work to gain widespread acceptance, extending work on organizational legitimacy and highlighting the growing number of purpose-driven organizations. We focus on emergent organizations because little is known about how they develop enough acceptance to become established in the first place. We examine the intersection of core stigma and strategies in emergent purpose-driven organizations through the provocative case of official university student organizations focused on kink and kinky sexuality. From examination of these organizations historical emergence and university-sanctioned constitutions, which provide an example of emergent organizations requiring sanction from a larger umbrella organization, we posit that (1) due process and impersonal evaluation processes enable recognition of taboo topics, particularly if official sanction is focused on organizational structure and roles, rather than actual practices and (2) organizations leverage credible social discourses, such as individual rights, tolerance, health and safety, to emphasize issues both pertinent to sanctioning organizations and mainstream throughout society, echoing the role of organizational goals within broader social and political advocacy. This research is timely given the explosion of emergent organizations today whose purpose is perceived as being socially taboo."
2017,"Identity Work and Its Influence on Institutions: From Criminal to Success This study extends theory on the role of identity work in institutionalization by exploring how actors manage their identities when they adopt the roles that are negatively evaluated by society. Drawing on the study of how counterfeit distributors managed their identities, we identified three forms of identity work  normalizing, moralizing, and professionalizing  that counterfeiters carried out to turn the negative institutional prescribed role-identity into a legitimate one in the eyes of themselves and key stakeholders, in which process the legitimacy of counterfeit business was constructed. We discuss the implications for identity management, identitys influence on institutionalization and stigma management."
2017,"Contestation, Scandal, and Stigmas Echo: Owlcatraz and the Naming of a Football Stadium Responding to calls to begin analyzing institutional contestation with greater nuance, this study uses an inductive, qualitative analysis of national media accounts focused on a scandal surrounding the relationship between a large, public southeastern university and a private, for-profit prison firm. We suggest that the scandal and associated reciprocal transfer of stigma between the firm and university highlighted contestation  contestation which eventually resulted in the termination of the organizations relationship  between three distinct institutional arrangements: the university, university athletics, and for-profit incarceration. By looking at the relationships between three distinct institutional arrangements, our study not only acknowledges the inherent complexity of the institutional environment these organizations find themselves at the nexus of, but illuminates the role of scandal and stigma transfer in perpetuating the contestation of institutional forces.

2017,"Biographical Opportunities: How Entrepreneurship Creates Pride in Alterity in Stigmatized Fields In this paper we explore the role entrepreneurship plays in influencing the shame of stigmatized work and its impact on actors institutional biographies. We do this through an inductive, qualitative study of female and transgender entrepreneurs operating in the sex trade. Our findings reveal that entrepreneurship created biographical opportunities that allowed for the construction of pride in alterity: a process of viewing the distinctiveness or otherness of ones biography as a value rather than a constraint. Pride in alterity shielded these individuals from feeling shamed by stigma associated with the field. Two distinct biographical opportunities allowed for the creation of pride in alterity: altering social position, by positioning as expert and in control; and building relational ties, the creation of supportive and intimate connections. Despite these opportunities, we found that the type of social change involved in the entrepreneurial efforts was an important source of variance. While some of the entrepreneurs were focused on changing how the world perceived sex work, other entrepreneurs were focused on changes to the practices in the field. Our analysis revealed that a focus on macro or micro social change lead to differences in the ways the entrepreneurs used biographical opportunities, and ultimately revealed constraints on the pride they were able to create."
2017,"Is Space Times Blind Spot? Towards a Processual Theorizing of Space Representation This paper addresses an often neglected level of process organizational analysis  space. A processual account of space shows how spatiotemporal assumptions matter in organizational practices of representation. We review theoretical challenges related to space representation, moving from static assumptions of space as simple location, and from critiques of the spatialization of time, to views of lived space as relational simultaneity of multiple durations. We show how these different conceptualizations of space underlie construction management practices, and influence the planning and construction of a cultural center. Our findings suggest that organizational representations of change reflect a separation of time and space as unitary and discrete containers. These representational practices influence how change of planned space is managed. While topographic representations maintain useful stabilizing functions, they fail to account for the multiple lived, relational and temporal dimensions of space, a relevant blind spot of process organizational analyses."
2017,"Managing Evaluation and Energy in Creative Idea Generation: Bringing in the Body Creative work requires devoted attention to nascent ideas that need to be developed to meet ambiguous evaluation criteria. The evaluation of ideas can push creative teamwork forward, but it can also sap energy. We studied creative champions to understand how team leaders orchestrate evaluation and organizational energy to increase team member involvement. Based on our video ethnographic shadowing data, we identified three key phases with distinct multimodal practices that team leaders took to orchestrate evaluation and manage energy. The multimodal practices in the meetings involved the use of body movement and voice in physical situations to arouse, align, and direct the team. In the first phase, team leaders draw attention to key evaluation criteria and create excitement through body movement and higher volume. In subsequent idea elaboration, leaders catalyze bottom-up evaluations from team members by stepping aside and remaining silent. They align the bodies in the meeting room to direct energy. In the final phase, committing, team leaders facilitate strengths-based collective evaluations and anchor the groups energy to the chosen creative ideas to reinforce commitment."
2017,"Toward a Spatial Perspective: An Integrative Review of Research on Organizational Space Organizational space, comprising both physical and non-physical places where organizational activities occur, has recently gained considerable attention in organization studies. While the large variety of concepts, perspectives and phenomena enriches our understanding of organizational spaces and their different aspects, this literature remains fragmented. To analyze this lack of consensus, we review the recent literature, finding four major themes within studies on organizational space: distribution, isolation, differentiation and intersection. Within these themes we identify boundaries, distances and movement as central elements of space, and develop them into an integrated framework that provides a novel spatial perspective. This unique perspective allows us to better analyze organizational phenomena and provides a new tool for future research on organizational space."
2017,"Working Identities: Individual and Organizational Identities in Womens Narrative Identity Work Work is an important setting for individuals identity work. As plural institutional contexts provide many possible courses of action, the organizational identity of ones employer can be a means for people to express their identity. However, research on narrative identity work has so far neglected the role of organizational identity. This paper explores how individual and organizational identities are constructed in narrative identity work. Drawing on qualitative data from focus groups with women who pursue careers in technical fields, we find participants utilizing three key identities to make sense of employment and that organizational experiences as well as societal beliefs are used as resources to negotiate these identities. We also show how four forms of interrelations between organizational identities and individual identities are constructed through narrative identity work. Our study elaborates the concept of narrative identity work, and deepens our understanding of organizational identities and of female careers."
2017,"Custodians of the Past. The Incremental Reproduction of Legacy Organizational Identity This study deepens understanding of how identity custodians strategically managed the legacy organizational identity through a single-case ethnographic approach of a Japanese multi-centenary firm. The legacy organizational identity was strategically managed by the seniority system incrementally opening access to the legacy organizational identity through the mechanisms of sanctifying, restricting and establishing the access to it. For organizations to successfully manage the fluid and problematic past, not all organizational members should be identity custodians, only selected actors should engage in restricted sensemaking of the legacy organizational identity, and this knowledge should be shared incrementally in the organization."
2017,"Dignity as Discursive Enactment of Tradition: A Narrative Approach on Tradition in Family Business Our current understanding of tradition in organizations remains very limited. The lack of studies that take 'tradition' as the main focus have made this concept overlooked as an important organizational feature. In this paper, I set out to address this issue by exploring how tradition is (re)produced and (re)interpreted in a century-old family-owned hotel. By adopting narrative approach as an interpretive lens, I found that the reproduction and reinterpretation of tradition is discursively mediated through the notion of dignity. In particular, this paper argues for three forms of 'doing' dignity: first, dignity-by-category that is enacted through the discursive use of category making; second, dignity-by-sanctity that is enacted through sanctifying particular relations; and third, dignity-by-authority that is enacted through the exercise of authority to compel others to acknowledge ones dignity. To extend it further, the possibility of conceptual relations between tradition, dignity, and narrative identity is discussed. Drawing from the broader fields of social sciences, this study contributes to the scarce literature on tradition theory and dignity in organizations."
2017,"Racial Bias and Repeated Interaction in the NBA There is strong evidence of racial bias in organizations but little understanding of how it changes with repeated interaction. This paper proposes that repeated interaction has the potential to reduce racial bias, but that its moderating effects are limited to the treatment of individuals rather than of entire racial groups. Using a unique, fine-grained dataset from the National Basketball Association, this paper applies robust models to show that while coaches give more playing time to same-race players than to other-race players, this bias decreases with respect to specific players as coaches become familiar with them. Repeated contact has little impact, however, on coaches overall racial biases even after years of coaching. These findings suggest that repeated interaction in the right contexts could reduce a decision-makers bias in the treatment of individuals but not of groups, making an important contribution to the literature on racial inequality in organizations."
2017,"`Birds of a Feather' Playing `Duck, Duck, Goose' Recent studies examining the direct impact of female managers on the career outcomes of their female subordinates find ambiguous results. Yet, these studies' narrow focus on wage inequality overlooks other mechanisms through which managerial gender diversity combined with in-group preferences of female managers for female employees can reduce workplace bias. For a woman seeking to build her career among organizations within an occupation, the ability to rely on the social capital, referrals, and recommendations of former managers can be the difference between finding a desirable job and being forced out of the occupation altogether. I examine this channel of homophily benefits for women in an occupational community in which a sizable proportion of workers as-good-as- randomly lose their jobs. I find that female workers who lose their jobs are more likely to find new jobs inside the community if they had a female manager immediately prior to job loss. In contrast, for workers who keep their jobs, having a female manager weakly increases the rate of occupational exit for \emph{both men and women}. The study demonstrates that managerial diversity has an outsized impact on women searching for new jobs within their occupation, an increasingly important juncture in modern careers in which women are often disadvantaged relative to men."
2017,"Discrimination in Information Sharing: A Field Experiment In a large national field experiment we document racial discrimination in information sharing. Email inquiries from one of twelve fictitious information- seekers were sent to 6,000 hotels across over 2,500 cities. Names of information- seekers signaled race (black, white, Asian), gender (male, female), and class (graduate degree, no graduate degree). The inquiry was simple, we asked for restaurant recommendations. Hotel representatives email responses revealed consistent evidence of discrimination based on three dimensions of quality: responsiveness, helpfulness, and rapport. First, nonwhite (i.e., black and Asian) information-seekers received fewer email responses than white information- seekers. Second, nonwhites received less helpful information than whites. Third, nonwhites received fewer attempts to build rapport than whites. Notably, nonwhites were recommended 20 percent fewer restaurants and were significantly less likely to receive personalized information than whites. We also examined moderating variables. Signaling status did not reduce racial discrimination. However, combining our experimental data with archival data from two different sourcesORBIS global company database and the United States censusrevealed that county political orientation (leaning liberal) and hotel size (increasing) attenuated some forms of discrimination. This study contributes to existing literature by focusing on the content of the information individuals are willing to share as a potential source of discrimination and pathway for inequality."
2017,"Paying for Mirrors or Windows? Consumer Discrimination and Hollywood Films Is employment discrimination driven by consumer bias rather than employer bias? One explanation for the persistence of employment discrimination, despite considerable legal and social pressure, is that unbiased employers are penalized by biased customers. An equitable employer is therefore a less profitable one, and apparent employer bias is more accurately described as reflected consumer antipathy. The empirical challenge of relating consumer behavior to employee composition has limited prior tests of this hypothesis and focused attention largely on employer behavior or structural factors. We provide a rare direct test of the claim that consumers respond to employee composition by evaluating the commercial and artistic performance of films released theatrically within the United States between 2011-2015 as a function of the racial diversity of their cast. We find that films are not penalized for the diversity of their casts; instead employing multiple black actors in the principal cast achieves significantly higher domestic box-office revenues than films with no black actors. Moreover, we find that international audiences do not exhibit evidence of bias against diverse casts, and that the net returns to diversity remain positive when worldwide box-office revenues are considered. We confirm the robustness of these results in a survey and experimental setting that controls for film-level differences, and through an analysis of a novel dataset capturing the social media activity (on Twitter) for each film by users of different races. Our findings advance an alternative interpretation of the consumer bias thesis, where consumers prefer employers reflect their world or values, rather than their traits."
2017,"Pulled in Two Directions. Being in Concert a Leader to Some and a Follower to Others Some individuals, in organizations are in a position where they need to attend in concert to their role as a leader to some, and a follower to others. It is important that they perform both roles equally effectively. Managers enacting these two roles in concert often face contradictory pulls, and experience tensions, widely described by the change and strategy literature. Nonetheless, how some people are more successful than others in performing in concert the roles of leader and follower is largely unexplored. This paper uses the theoretical lens of paradox to propose a process of harmonization of the contradictory pulls that come with the co- enactment of the roles of leader and follower. This theoretical investigation happens in the context of the leadership triad, formed by a focal individual, his/her leader and his/her follower. Following paradox theory, a model is built, highlighting how successful focal individuals acknowledge and accept their self- concept both as an able leader and an able follower. The mechanisms of harmonization are two fold. First, through psychological flexibility focal individuals attend to the material and practical tensions, stemming from conflicting constituents demands and needs. Second, through sensegiving and sensemaking they attend to the psychological and cognitive tensions, caused by conflicting interpretations of events. The harmonization of the paradoxical pulls reinforces individuals self-concept as able leader and an able follower, perpetuating a virtuous cycle of harmonization, which characterizes a successful leadership triad."
2017,"Serving or Being Served? Leadership under Conflicting Institutional Logics in Transition China Drawing on institutional theory, we explore the indigenous leadership in China by analyzing the interaction between leaders and the institutional environment. We provide novel answers to three fundamental questions in leadership research: what leadership is, where leadership influences come from, and how leaders influence followers. In conceptualizing the Chinese institutional context in transition as ambidextrous, we argue that leadership in China is dominated by two logics: the professional logic adopted from Western democracy and the authoritarian logic originating in the local culture. Our arguments advance leadership research in general and contribute to the understanding of leadership in China in particular by developing a dual-logic leadership model that integrates an institutional perspective."
2017,"Power or Embeddedness? Differing Impact of Leaders Logic on Followers Innovative Behavior This study aims to build a framework concerning a mediated model in explaining the impact of leaders logic with which the leaders imbue when interacting with subordinates on fostering innovative behaviors. Drawing upon resource dependence theory, we argue that psychological empowerment will mediate the relationship between leaders underlying logic (e.g., logic of power and logic of embeddedness) and followers innovative behavior. Building on Gulati & Sytchs (2007) study examining relative strength of the logic of power and the logic of embeddedness on firms performance, we theorize on a different impact of leaders logic on followers innovative behavior. We propose that leaders who perceive leader- follower dyad as a power game will inhibit the followers innovative behavior since the followers would be less psychologically empowered, whereas the leaders who perceive the dyadic relationship as mutually dependent and, in turn, beneficial in long term will stimulate the followers innovative behavior via heightened psychological empowerment of the followers. We expect our theorization would deliver theoretical implication in fostering individuals innovative behavior in organizations before discussing the effectiveness of specific leadership styles."
2017,"Beyond Leadership: A Study of Organizational Hubris  We examine the concept of organizational hubris using testimony from a Public Inquiry into the downfall of a UK hospital. Our framing extends hubris beyond a trait within a singular leader, to an embedded process that resides within the fabric of organizational life. We examine accounts of how falling organizational standards led to an unacceptable number of patient deaths and an environment of workplace intimidation. From these accounts we theorize how a leader-endorsed hubristic ideology leads to the organizational proliferation and normalization of hubris. The actions and justifications associated with hubris create a shared unity so powerful that organizational members collectively turn a blind-eye to wrong- doing. The hubristic organization loses contact with reality. Organizational reasoning is shifted to allow ever more serious transgressions to be justified. This shift makes hubris more difficult to eradicate than simply challenging or changing the leadership."
2017,"Creating Interstitial Spaces to Encourage the Genesis of New Practices We develop a typology of interstitial spaces showing that these arise at different points of between-ness, and that in different interstitial spaces new practices are generated from between different elements. In contrast to established models that suggest interstitial spaces occur rather naturally at the interface of fields, we show empirically that interstitial spaces are created at field overlap, at the interface of fields, and around new world views. Our empirical setting sits at the interface of an addiction treatment field. Our in-depth study of this setting allowed us to uncover the different interstitial space created by actors to encourage the genesis of new practice. We contribute to the literature by identifying where different interstitial spaces are created, the point of origin of new practices in different interstitial spaces, and the different micro-interactions that occur in these spaces. Our findings illuminate the agentic creation of interstitial spaces formed to encourage new practice."
2017,"Intermediation in Contexts of Ferment: A Multilevel Approach to Institutional Emergence Despite the importance of the early stages of field formation in defining the future boundaries and characteristics of those fields, institutional theorists have devoted limited attention to the early moments of institutional life. In this article, I review current approaches that make use of actor- and field-level mechanisms to understanding the genesis of new institutions, and I propose a new approach that starts from those contexts that are poised for emergence and transformation. This framework highlights the institutional complexity and ambiguity that characterizes these contexts of ferment, as well as the interactions and brokerage processes that become central in these situations. I finally portray different intermediation mechanisms that drive the early moments of institutions by reassembling previously dispersed resources, disconnected ties, and unclear meanings. This multilevel approach to institutional emergence contributes to the specification of field conditions, inter-organizational processes, and organizational mechanisms that drive the birth of new fields."
2017,"Behind the Scenes: A Backstage Look at Field Formation within Sustainability in Higher Education In this paper, we explore the development of the field of environmental sustainability in higher education through changes in shared discourse. We utilize the analytical method of topic modelling to examine how the backstage discourse has changed longitudinally within an online community of individuals who were involved in constructing this field between 1992 and 2010, based on an archive of 9,540 forum messages exchanged during that period. In particular, we measure changes in the issues that have been present in the discourse over time and connect those issues to actor groups who were vying to shape the early years of field construction. We explore the co-evolution of issues, shared opinion, and groups to examine whether or not shared meaning gets constructed in the process of field evolution in this case."
2017,"Market Emergence, Hybridization and the Use of Social Finance in the UK Charity Sector Due to increasing pressure from the broader institutional environment, long standing industries dominated by one logic are becoming more complex. This paper looks at how emerging hybrid opportunities (i.e. an opportunity combining two logics) encourages executives of organizations characterized by a rigid institutional logic to challenge their organizations and environments dominant logic. Through an in-depth case-study of the emergent use of social finance by charities in the UK, we describe a process by which organizational leaders introduce hybridity into their organization by engaging with the social impact investment market. Our process model describes how leaders with in-depth knowledge of two logics cognitively identify and screen an opportunity in the emerging market. Once completed, they begin to change the organization across dimensions that conflict with the new logic using three mechanisms framing, enveloping external experts and building alliances. We then show that firms can engage with the new market if this process is successful or engage with it symbolically if the change process is only partially successful. These findings provide the first in-depth description of a process of hybridization and in doing so increase our knowledge of how hybridization works, how executives embedded in one logic can act as agents of institutional change and how hybrid market opportunities are taken."
2017,"Clique to Win? Impact of Simmelian Ties on Collaborative Project Performance Large infrastructure and public works projects require resources not often found in individual firms. Competitive bidding motivates contractors to form partnerships with subcontractors to win and implement such projects. Projects with no prior interactions between partners tend to develop structural holes, providing the coordinating contractors with brokering privileges. But through repeated project interactions communication and trust develops giving rise to cohesive clique networks and Simmelian ties. Instead of asymmetric power structures, cliques develop group norms and constrain opportunistic behavior by members. How do these two different collaborative arrangements engaging distinct network microstructures impact project outcomes? This study examines the role of network structures on collaborative project outcomes in a novel setting where multiple firms collaborate and compete to win and execute projects. Multi-year longitudinal network analysis of public infrastructure projects implemented in the State of California, reveal that compared to dyadic ties, Simmelian ties and network closure between team members help thwart external competition and internal opportunistic behavior leading to favorable project outcomes. Our empirical results contribute to network theory and multipartner alliance formation by examining the dynamics of inter-firm collaborative network structures and subsequent effect on collaborative work."
2017,"Structural Holes and the Value of Organizational Capabilities While structural holes theory seeks to provide a social structural explanation of competitive advantage, the theory is largely silent on how a firms network position influences its ability to develop organizational capabilities. This is concerning given the prominence of organizational capabilities in explanations of competitive advantage in the strategic management literature. In this paper, we address this gap by formally integrating the assumptions of structural holes theory with those of the capabilities perspective in a simulation model. The model produces several new theoretical insights. The primary insight is that brokerage involves a tradeoff in capability development, the discovery- competence tradeoff, which helps to determine the size of the effect of brokerage on capability value."
2017,"Network Strength: Performance of Interorganizational Networks in Healthcare ACOs Why do some networks perform better than others? Although strong ties have been shown to be beneficial for interorganizational activity at the dyadic level, we argue that this relationship may be more complex at the level of the network. We introduce a novel construct  network strength  to explore how tie strength and network fragmentation interact to affect the ability of whole networks to achieve shared strategic goals. Building on prior studies of tie strength and network structure, we argue that network strength helps performance at the level of the network too, but can also be detrimental if it reinforces relational schisms in fragmented networks. Using patient sharing data for physicians and health organizations in the United States, we reconstruct the complex interorganizational relationships that underlie Medicare Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) allowing us to compare nearly 200 ACO networks and their outcomes over a three-year period. We find evidence that network strength leads to better efficiency, but also find that this effect weakens as the network becomes more fragmented. Overall, our study explores how previously little-researched interactions between network structural and relational properties affect the performance of whole networks, and provides new insights into an important social context."
2017,"From Fan to Foe? How Ventures Manage Stakeholder Relations as They Move from Start-up to Scale-up Moving from start-up to scale-up is one of the biggest challenges for new ventures. During this process, we find that new ventures face a particularly difficult hurdle in transitioning those stakeholders who strongly identify with the venture. Based on an inductive study of the interactions between a producer of analog instant photography and its fan community, we identify different fan reactions to scale-up and suggest a set of organizational responses. Specifically, we find that fans can take on three discrete roles: cheerleaders (who support the venture), enemies (who oppose the venture), and bystanders (who disengage from the venture). In turn, we show that organizations can employ identification appeasement actions to maintain cheerleaders and to turn dangerous enemies into bystanders. Our study contributes to scholarship by outlining a new approach for overcoming the entrepreneurial scale-up challenge, uncovering the dark side of evangelists, and nuancing the role of emotions in organizational identification."
2017,"The Power of Strong Plots: Storytelling Strategies for Venture Legitimation in Nascent Markets Stories are crucial for ventures to attain legitimacy in the ambiguous contexts of nascent markets. However, while extant research explores how stories provide comprehension, new ventures cannot rest on cognitive legitimacy alone in the prevalence of high ambiguity. We study inductively how stories create legitimacy for ventures in nascent markets, through a four-year qualitative study of venture narrations in nascent markets within the broader field of electric vehicles. We find that managers invoke 'strong plots' of ventures in nascent markets in their storytelling, by weaving together archetypes from broader cultural discourses. We theorize how strong plots have the capacity to shape legitimacy judgments of audiences by eliciting institutionalized expectations about the focal venture, and we present a conceptual model of strong plots for pragmatic and moral legitimation of ventures in nascent markets. By reconciling this with existing research, we contribute a holistic and dynamic conception of venture legitimation strategies in nascent markets."
2017,"An Organization with Many Faces: a Crowd-based Ventures Versatility in Resource Mobilization Under the umbrella of the cultural entrepreneurship literature, scholars seek to shed light on how ventures use cultural strategies (e.g. symbolic action, narratives) to aid resource-holding audiences in making sense of their venture and stimulate the provision of resources. With our study, we seek to fill two gaps in the literature, namely, a holistic understanding of resource mobilization strategies (i.e. material and symbolic practices) and going beyond dyadic situations (i.e. a venture addressing more than one stakeholder simultaneously). The empirical context for our investigation is the organizing practices of a crowd-based venture, which connects clients having innovation- and design problems with creatives (i.e. the crowd) providing solutions to these problems. We find that both material and symbolic practices can be adapted to or enhance the social world of a resource holding audience. Mechanisms, such as separating, coalescing and balancing allow for addressing multiple audiences simultaneously."
2017,"The Positive of Negative: Language Tone and the Acquisition of Key Resources We explore the fundamental question of how individuals acquire resources. While much research on impression management suggests that positivity in pitches to investors enables better resource acquisition, there is a lack of empirical research showing whether and to what extent this is true. Using existing theory and a combination of quantitative and qualitative data on over 50,000 loans from peer-to-peer lending site Prosper.com we examine how the sentiment in text-only pitches to investors affects how individuals acquire resources. Contrary to our expectations, we find that negatively worded pitches are funded faster than positively worded ones. We also find that negatively worded pitches provide individuals attempting to acquire resources with lower (vs higher) interest rates. Finally, we find that negatively worded loans have lower default rates than positively worded loans thereby suggesting that the benefits of negativity are not one-sided but rather two- sided  negativity helps both resource seekers and resource providers. Collectively the results from our study reveal how negativity can be beneficial in impression management and offer fresh insights for the psychological foundations of strategy."
2017,"The Effect of Managerial Interpretations of Aspiration Discrepancies on Production Asset Growth Managerial interpretations of performance-aspiration discrepancies, i.e. causal attributions by managers to explain performance that deviates from aspiration levels, have a crucial role in directing attention, constraining search and driving strategic investment decisions. Hence, understanding organizational responses to performance-aspiration discrepancies requires investigating managerial attributions of causality. We examine this question using a sample of 2,479 Spanish manufacturing firms from 1998 to 2012 and exploring variations in the relationship between productivity aspiration discrepancies and production asset growth induced by managers attributions of causality. Consistent with our contention, we find that managers causal attributions help explain the heterogeneity of organizational responses to performance-aspiration discrepancies. This study provides a more complete and nuanced understanding of the association between performance that deviates from aspiration levels and the capital allocation process, recognizing managerial causal attributions as a key cause of variation in the relationship between performance-aspiration discrepancies and both the mean and variability of strategic investments."
2017,"Antecedents of Organizational Aspirations: Attention to the Future, Past, and Situational Context We investigate the antecedents of organizational aspirations (goals, targets). Specifically, we seek to enhance understanding of forward-looking and backward-looking antecedents, as well as situational context factors in aspiration determination (goal setting) through the undertaking of a mixed-method investigation. Study 1 reports findings of interviews of 21 top executives in 17 organizations. We identify future performance expectations as the most prevalent antecedent. Further, we observe that antecedents are more or less used depending on situational context factors. Using the lens of the Attention-Based View, we establish hypotheses by combining our inductive findings with logics from the broader goal-setting literature. In study 2, we test our hypotheses for forward-looking, backward-looking, and situational context factors based on a multi-country survey of 524 top executives. We find a high prevalence of forward-looking antecedents of aspirations and identify the salient roles of competitive turbulence, strategic aggressiveness, and performance relative to aspiration. Our results suggest updates to the behavioral theory of aspirations by demonstrating the prevalent use of forward-looking antecedents in aspiration determination. Overall, our work begins to lay a foundation for an attention-based theory of aspiration antecedents."
2017,"Managerial Responses at the Interface between Stretch Goals and Organizational Performance Many academics, consultants and managers advocate the use of stretch goals in the belief that difficult-to-achieve goals generate creative tension, motivate employees, and yield superior performance. However, the proponents of stretch goals ignore that difficult-to-achieve goals can have either facilitative or disruptive effects within organizations depending on managers cognitive and affective responses to the goals. Using a management simulation in an experimental lab study, we test the effects of three goal difficulty levels  moderate, stretch, and seemingly impossible in increasing difficulty level  and find that increasing goal difficulty stimulates risk taking, reduces goal commitment, decreases self-efficacy, and increases anxiety. We also find no difference in financial performance between moderate and stretch goals, but show that seemingly impossible goals decrease financial performance. Our results provide empirical evidence for a nonlinear relationship between goal difficulty level, managerial affective and cognitive responses, and organization performance."
2017,"Does Profitability Matter? How Intermediate Objectives & Strategic Focus Influence Search Behavior Profitability is the primary objective of strategic managersor is it? How might a firms strategic focus influence this ranking of objectives? The strategy literature is replete with evidence that profitability is the ultimate performance objective, but we contend that it is not always the first consideration in the decision-making process. We underscore circumstances in which stage-linked objectives that feed into ultimate profitability may take precedence over profitability in managerial decisions. This has critical implications for when the assumptions of the Behavioral Theory of the Firmthat managers become complacent after superior performance, but engage in problemistic search after inferior performancewill apply. With this research, we focus on the stage-linked objectives of product quality and product profitability, arguing that superior profitability only leads to complacency when quality is also superior. We also examine whether a firms strategic focus, as manifested in its historical linkage between quality and profitability, influences this quality contingency effect. Though we do find that quality performance is a key contingency on the profitability-complacency relationship, we find counterintuitive results about how a quality-based strategic focus influences this effect. This provides some insight into how a firms strategic focus influences managers tendency toward myopic or forward-looking search."
2017,"Learning One's Place: How Status Matters for Social Capital in Collegial Communities  It is often presumed that individuals working together in communities will lead to collaboration and learning. However, there are challenges involved in building community. Not all individuals are equally well-integrated nor do they have equal access to community social capital given patterns of tie activation. This longitudinal study of 215 urban public school teachers in the U.S. indicates individuals social status affects their community ties. Individuals perceived to have high status are communicated with more frequently. Low status individuals are communicated with less frequently. Individuals who perceive their status more favorably than their colleagues associate more with members of other communities. These status inconsistent individuals, while appearing to learn more from colleagues, may mainly gain surface-level understandings of work practices."
2017,"Liability of High Status: Overpayment to Relieve Status Anxiety in the English Premier League Extant literature on status has emphasized the benefits of high status for organizations. This paper, however, explores the economic costs that high status actors may accrue in market transactions. We hypothesize that high status actors are likely to engage in economically costly efforts, such as overpayment in acquiring resources that critically influence their image to relieve their status anxiety. We also hypothesize that they are more likely to engage in such behavior when there are no other efficient ways to relieve the status anxiety and when such behavior is particularly effective in alleviating the anxiety. Empirical analysis with the panel data of the English Premier League teams provides strong supports for the hypotheses. It finds that high status teams are more likely to purposely overpay for the acquisition of players, especially for younger ones and in the summer transfer windows. Based on the results, we discuss theoretical implications, limitations, and future research directions."
2017,"Status Seeking and Boundary Breaking: Why Middle-Status Universities Commercialize Less in China? One of the classical insights sociology provides for organizational studies is that opportunities and incentives for boundary-crossing and institutional change are embedded in social structures, such as status hierarchies. Building on this insight, this paper examines how status seeking in a hierarchy, rather than status itself, affect a typical example of boundary-crossing behavioruniversities commercialization of research output. Prevailing accounts claim that statuses affect actors tendencies for crossing boundaries by providing cumulative advantages or exerting normative constraints. Going beyond the effect of status itself, this paper argues: 1) status- seeking incentives are differentially distributed in a status hierarchy; 2) status-seeking efforts affect boundary-crossing behavior differently for organization actors of different statuses. Empirically, I draw on both quantitative and qualitative data to investigate the effect of Chinese universities status-seeking efforts in the state- run academic tournament, measured by the number of prestigious national titles and awards each university obtains annually. For both high-status (985 universities) and low-status (non-211 universities) universities, status-seeking have a positive effect on their commercialization behavior. However, for middle-status (non-985 but 211 universities) universities, their status-seeking efforts have a significant and negative impact. Further analysis shows that this negative effect is explained by the fact that middle-status actors tend to respond more negatively to local market incentives and utilize less of their high-quality research publications when they invest a lot in status seeking."
2017,"Of Conquests and Exodus: Settlements and the Institutionalization Process We examine the impact of settlements at field and organizational levels, and how collective action impacts institutional processes across these levels. This paper brings together the two literatures  one on the role of collective action in generating field level processes and the other on the role of organizational politics in key organizational processes - by examining the mechanisms by which field-level collective action impacts organizational settlements and how, in turn, organizational settlements impact field level processes. We present findings from fieldwork examining collective action in the broadcasting field in South Korea where the state imposed a field settlement, which in turn begot organizational settlements in two public broadcasters. We show that while journalists from both broadcasters exited the organizations in protest, negotiated organizational settlement was associated with increased field diversification, whereas coercive organizational settlement was instrumental in increasing hybridity in the field. We conclude with a discussion of contributions to the study of collective action and settlements in fields and organizations."
2017,"Micro-Foundations of Institutional Logic Shifts: Entrepreneurial Action in Response to Crises Institutional logics shape how actors interpret and organize their environment. While institutional logics influence organizations, they are not free floating, but rather are instantiated in the practices and patterned behaviors of actors who act as carriers of logics in specific contexts. Given the dynamic interaction between institutional logics and individual / organizational actors, some research has begun to explore the micro-level processes that influence institutional logic changes to help explain how and why those who are shaped by an institution enact changes in the very context in which they are embedded. In this paper, I explore a potentially promising pathway for advancing theory on institutional logic formation and change by building on the literature on entrepreneurship and opportunity exploitation. I offer an entrepreneurship model of logic shifts that explores how crises induce sensemaking activities that can influence shifts in logics and pursuit of entrepreneurial opportunities. I argue that environmental jolts allow individuals to problematize previously held beliefs and logics, providing a pathway to identify novel opportunities that otherwise may have gone unnoticed. This serves as an explanation for how broader institutional logics may shift as a result of the interaction between entrepreneurial action and the environment following a major disruption. I offer propositions and suggest contributions to research on institutional logics, environmental jolts, and entrepreneurship."
2017,"The Dynamics of Rhetoric in Disrupted Organizational Fields This paper explores the dynamic interplay between rhetorical structure and rhetorical strategy in a disrupted organizational field. Drawing from a study of mainstream media coverage of consumer debt throughout the financial crisis, we examine how changes in the conditions of a field are associated with unique configurations of rhetorical structure and strategy. Our findings demonstrate how these rhetorical configurations evolve along with the field and, thus, how changes in the field impact the role that rhetoric plays in institutional processes. Our study contributes to research on language and institutions by fleshing out how rhetoric both reflects and shapes institutional processes in disrupted fields."
2017,"Contextual Readiness and Institutional Breakthroughs: A Study of the Fight Against Corruption While there has been increasing attention in institutional theory on how purposeful actors can disrupt even deeply entrenched practices, we focus on the role of the context in fuelling these efforts. We analyse one of the largest anti-corruption operations ever launched in Brazil: the 'Lava Jato' (Car Wash Operation) and its antecedents, the contextual enablers of change and the institutional work of agents involved in this operation. We find that the confluence of jolts, gradual changes in the field, and the cumulating work of purposeful actors were essential for anti- corruption actions to gain traction across the country and lead to a breakthrough in the fight against corruption. We develop a model to explain how actors seeking institutional change are contextually empowered and their efforts yield breakthroughs only at certain points in time when the context is ripe for change. Our findings contribute both to institutional theory and the corruption literature."
2017,"Environmental Jolts and Organizational Resilience In this study, we investigate how proximity can be a source of organizational resilience. Building on the research on the steeling effect, which shows that exposure to threats can increase the capacity for recovery, we develop an understanding of why US firms responded more positively to the 9/11 attacks than the non-US firms. Using the data on global alliance activity in the oil industry prior and subsequent to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, we find that while there was a general decrease in alliance activity throughout the world, the decrease was significantly smaller for US firms compared to non-U.S. firms. In the presence of slack, US firms paid greater attention to competence development and increased the number of alliances, and non-US firms prioritized stability that limited the number of alliances. This difference in perspectives led to a geographical confinement of alliance activity leading to US firms partnering more frequently with firms from the US and non-US firms preferring non-US partners. Our study shows that proximity to an environmental jolt can be a valuable source of organizational resilience. Beyond recovery, it can affect the nature of relationships such that resilient firms seek others that are also resilient. This explains why resilience does not diffuse easily but remains a localized effect."
2017,"The Conditions of Cognitive Complexity: How Performance Pressures Induce Simple Thinking in CEOs We contribute to the literature on CEO cognitions, particularly addressing the concept of CEO cognitive complexity, which is ones tendency to engage in multidimensional (as opposed to unidimensional) and nuanced (as opposed to black-and-white) thinking. In contrast to most research on cognitive complexity, we explore its antecedents, envisioning that cognitive complexity is a quasi-trait that exhibits some persistence but also substantial intra-person variation, depending on contextual conditions. Drawing from theory about executive job demands, we argue that performance pressures  in multiple forms  cause stress on CEOs, which in turn affects their cognitive processes. When pressures are intense, CEOs cognitively simplify; with every increment of diminished pressure, CEOs become cognitively more complex. Using a novel measure of CEO cognitive complexity, based upon CEOs language in the question-and- answer portions of quarterly conference calls, we study variance in cognitive complexity of 652 CEOs across 9,813 calls. We find, in line with our theory, that CEOs exhibit personal baseline tendencies but also substantial variations from their baselines, depending on performance pressures. Specifically, a CEOs cognitive complexity is positively associated with tenure in office, recent performance, and slack. We discuss implications and future research opportunities that are facilitated by our findings and new measure."
2017,"A Contingency Theory of Representational Complexity in Organizations A long-standing question in the organizations literature is whether a rm is better-o by using a simple or a complex representation of its task environment. We address this question by developing a formal model of how rm performance depends on the process by which firms learn and use representations. Building on ideas from cognitive psychology, our model conceptualizes this process in terms of how firms construct a representation of the environment and then use that representation when making decisions. Our model identifies the optimal level of representational complexity as a function of (a) the environment's complexity and uncertainty and (b) the manager's experience and knowledge about the environment's deep structure. We use this model to delineate the conditions under which firms should use simple versus complex representations; in doing so, we provide a coherent framework that integrates previous conflicting results on which type of representation leaves firms better-o. Among other results, we show that the optimal representational complexity depends more on the manager's knowledge about the environment than it does on the environment's actual complexity. We also show that there are more conditions under which simple representations outperform complex representations than vice versa."
2017,"Microfoundations of Organizational Paradox: Paradox Mindset, Limited Resources and Tensions Competing tensions and demands pervade our work lives, and accumulating research examines organizational and leadership approaches to leveraging these tensions. But what about individuals within firms? Although early paradox theory built upon micro-level insights from psychology and philosophy to understand the nature and management of varied competing demands, corresponding empirical studies are rare, offering scarce insights into why some individuals thrive with tensions while others struggle. In response, we contribute to the microfoundations of organizational paradox with a theoretical model and robust measures that help us to begin to unpack individuals varied approaches to tensions. Following rigorous scale development in Study 1, including samples from the US, UK, Israel, and China, we test our model in a large firm in the US using quantitative and qualitative methods. We identify resource scarcity (i.e. limited time and funding) as a possible source of tensions. We also demonstrate that a paradox mindset  the extent to which one is accepting of and energized by tensions  can help individuals leverage them to improve job performance and innovation. Our results highlight paradox mindset as a key to unlocking the potential of everyday tensions."
2017,"Opportunism? It is All Relative! Antecedents and Consequences of Subjective Opportunism Judgments I argue that when formal contracts are not present to anchor the definition of what constitutes opportunistic behaviors during an interfirm exchange relationship (e.g. when the exchange is governed through relational devices), ex-post opportunism takes a subjective nature such that parties frequently find themselves in a position to interpret unexpected exchange behaviors by their partners and make subjective opportunism judgments. I then develop hypotheses on the factors that shape those judgments and on the consequences of those judgments. Results from the first experiment show that opportunism judgments are indeed subjectively formed and they are shaped by the nature of the behavior, perceived strength of the relationship, nature of the causal account provided for the action, and personality traits of the actor making the judgment. Furthermore, opportunism judgments influence important outcomes such as intentions for repeat exchange and intentions to use relational governance devices in the future, pointing to the practical significance of variance in opportunism judgments. A second experiment further highlights the subjectivity of opportunism judgments by demonstrating the influence of perspective. In particular victims systematically make higher opportunism judgments than transgressors on the same behavior and the factors that influence victims opportunism judgments do not influence transgressors opportunism judgments."
2017,"Managerial Dismissal as A Symbolic Activity Previous research has investigated the antecedents and implications of managerial dismissal using multiple perspectives, but few studies considered the symbolic role of top-level managers and symbolic meaning of their dismissal. I advance a symbolic management perspective on managerial dismissal research, suggesting that a symbolic dismissal of top-level managers is often associated with poor performance and results in favorable reaction from both external and internal stakeholders. Additionally, I discuss the contingencies of symbolic dismissal: a. short-term oriented organizations are more likely to symbolically dismiss their top-level managers; and b. external stakeholders are more sensitive to such action and react more favorably than internal stakeholders. My research brings new insights into the managerial dismissal research and examines the symbolic management perspective in a new context."
2017,"Changing of the Guards: The Impact of CEO Succession on Corporate Reputation CEOs are powerful leaders who influence their firms reputations. This study focuses on CEO successions specifically. These are prominent and consequential events whose reputational impacts are not well understood. We conceptualize successions as a) disruptive events in itself and b) a changing of the guard, which emphasizes the specific CEOs involved. We use this conceptualization to examine reputational effects of CEO successions in a large sample of U.S. corporations from 1992 to 2004. We find that both characteristics of the event itself (e.g., retirement vs. dismissal) and of CEOs themselves shape how successions affect corporate reputations. Implications are discussed."
2017,"Guardians of the Previous Regime: Post-CEO Succession Factional Subgroups and Firm Performance How can newly-hired CEOs compose their executive team to realize high performance? We attend to this question by drawing on the notion of factional subgroups. We propose that TMT change after a CEO succession event can promote the emergence of a factional faultline between executives hired by the new CEO, and executives who had been TMT members prior to succession (the guardians of the previous regime). Such faultlines will lead to destructive TMT processes and, thus, advance undesirable firm performance. We also argue that these detrimental effects of post-CEO succession factional faultlines will be stronger when: (a) the firm faced poor financial performance prior to succession, (b) the new CEO is hired from outside the firm, and (c) the incumbent executives shared a longer-term experience with the predecessor CEO. Data from 154 CEO succession events in large European firms between 2008 and 2013 support some of our hypotheses. Overall, our study contributes to upper echelons and strategic leadership research  by highlighting the importance of TMT reconfiguration after a CEO succession event."
2017,"Reconsidering Identity within Becketts Unnamable: Some Implications of the Novel for Organization This paper engages with the text of The Unnamable by Samuel Beckett and attempts to glean insights into organizational issues in particular, insights focusing on organization identity formation. I argue that, by taking such a solipsistic stance in his novel, Beckett has in effect engaged in an oblique form of discourse and hence organizational analysis. In apparently saying nothing, the author has essentially said something. Drawing on the insights from the text, therefore, I question the simple cause-and-effect relationships surrounding identity formation that our discipline tends to assume. Secondly, the novel, through its reductive representation of a life lived at its extreme limit points, helps us, by extension, to understand the micro-sociological foundations of institutional work. This it does by allowing for a thorough, albeit completely fictional, exploration into the interiority of the mind of the Unnamable narrator. Through the lessons learnt from the text, I argue that our discipline tends to downplay the effort and difficulty involved in the process of identity, and hence institutional, work, and I explore how our discipline could be enriched by a more nuanced consideration of these issues by exchanging experiences at the interface with another discipline."
2017,"We Are Good at Riding the Storms: Identity-based Responses to Organizational Threats This ethnographic study investigates how innovative organizations operating in a high-velocity environment respond to external threats. Under the purview of this broad research goal, it asks two more specific interrelated questions. First, how does an organizations early experience and response to threat affect its initial identity formation? And second, how does this identity shape the organizations subsequent responses to threats? The findings show that an organizations experience with a major threat in its early days can lie at the source of its identity formation, shape its core identity attributes, and determine how subsequent threats are perceived, made sense of, and responded to. Through an analysis of multiple threats encountered and responded to by this organization, this study shows the interplay between organizational threat, identity formation and organizations responses to threats. This paper contributes to the literature on organizational identity - its formation and its role in organizational survival and growth."
2017,"Driving Change by Consensus: Dialogue and Culture Change at IBM We analyze two jams conducted at IBM in 2003-4. These were open discussions on the intranet of the values and practices of the company, involving a large swath of employees. We argue that the actual discussion came reasonably close to the standards of true dialogue, with little restriction of expression or distortion by hierarchical differences. We also document two important shifts in the conversation: a movement from a Traditionalistic frame emphasizing internal loyalty and stability, to a Collaborative frame emphasizing coordination of diverse capabilities around external challenges; and a development of the second frame towards greater conceptual sophistication and implementation in practice. We suggest that the combination of a developed ideational frame and practical application indicates a profound shift in organizational logic. While we cannot draw a causal link between the jam dialogues and the emergence of a new logic, the evidence suggests that the use of open dialogue rather than top-down cascading helped in developing a new common language and logic."
2017,"Oscillation as a Mechanism for the Maintenance of Conflicting Organizational Identities Organizations with conflicting organizational identities suffer from internal tensions that must be managed. Prior research suggests many compelling strategies to manage these tensions (e.g., segmentation, compartmentalization, or deletion), but these strategies either momentarily or permanently limit the expression of one of these identities. This study examines the organization Extreme Gym, which uses a strategy that does not structurally limit the expression of its conflicting organizational identities and instead fully enacts them in the same physical space. A contrarian organizational identity Go Hard until You Puke is enacted for elite athletes and a conformist organizational identity Go at Your Own Pace is enacted for casual athletes. Analyses based on participant observation and interviews with entrepreneurs and organizational members suggest that Extreme Gym is able to manage the tensions that arise from these conflicting organizational identities through the strategy of oscillation: alternating between events that unite and stratify organizational members on a daily basis. This process privileges each organizational identity at punctuated intervals without limiting their expression. Enacting both of these conflicting organizational identities allows Extreme Gym to be similar to and different from pre-existing market offeringsa strategy that could potentially position Extreme Gym for high growth among all customer segments."
2017,"Institutional Effects in the Worldwide Expansion of Innovation In this paper, I conceptualize innovation as a core institution of the global economy, and study the factors involved in its expansion across the globe. Specifically, I examine local conditions and global institutional pressures affecting a countrys willingness to take part in the innovation economy, its level of expenditure on innovation, and the actual product of those expenditures. I used even-history models and panel regressions to test the aforementioned relationships on a sample of 132 countries from 1996 to 2012. There are four main findings. First, developing countries that are close to the advanced countries (in the core of the global political economy) are likely to comply with the norms of the core and initiate symbolic actions to be considered as participants of the innovation economy. Second, countries are likely to mimic neighbors in their innovation spending patterns. Third, most developing regions of the world show signs of decoupling (producing significantly less innovation patents at the same level of R&D; spending that the core). And, fourth, local competition increases mimetic isomorphism regarding innovation but it also reduces decoupling in the production of patents. These results suggest that there is imitation of the global core and of neighbors despite sub- standard levels of efficiency, and that participating in innovation may be as important as producing actual innovation."
2017,"Perception and Adoption of Occupational Licensure by Entrepreneurs: Tax Preparers in the U.S. We examine the relationship between entrepreneurship and occupational licensure by studying voluntary early adopters of a tax preparation license. To date, scholars have focused mainly on the downsides of occupational licensure, implying that entrepreneurs should be less likely to adopt an occupational license because of compliance and regulatory costs. Conversely, we highlight the legitimizing benefits of occupational licensure and propose that aspiring entrepreneurs might be more likely to adopt a license, when the benefits of signaling legitimacy outweigh the costs of compliance. We illustrate this point by analyzing a sample of practitioners in tax preparation, some of whom open their own practice. Such entrepreneurs are more likely to voluntarily adopt federal licenses in states that do not require a state license and thus do not provide a substitute quality signal."
2017,"Making Sense of Decoupling Through Narration: The Case of Anti-Corruption Previous organizational research on decoupling has suggested that there is a trade-off between compliance and goal achievement as efforts to remedy the decoupling of policies from practices tend to jeopardize efforts to remedy the decoupling of means from ends. We expand on previous research on the trade- off in the context of anti-corruption by developing a process model of how temporal and distributed sensemaking helps actors re- interpret and resolve through narration the tensions that this trade-off potentially creates. Our theoretical model is underpinned by data from a case study on anti-corruption where a set of heterogeneous narratives on the complianceachievement gap converged into a solution- and progress-oriented narrative shared by the majority of actors involved. We elucidate how and why the notion of a trade-off shifts the meanings, realities, and behaviors that it predicts and can thus become self-negating. Our study refines the understanding of the social dynamics of decoupling and helps to further explore the conditions under which the complianceachievement gap is socially deconstructed and the mechanisms that mediate this process."
2017,"Predicting the Symbolic Use of Ethical Violation Reporting Systems Call-in hotlines are commonly used by organizations as a way to comply with ethics regulations and expectations from outside constituencies. Such hotlines are perceived to reduce ethical misconduct, and thus adoption is often considered a substantiated action on behalf of the organization in attempt to minimize ethical misconduct. There is the possibility, however, that such hotlines are simply a symbolic gesture made by organizations to eliminate pressures to adhere to certain ethical standards. The current research examines this possibility. Relying upon institutional theory and theories of ethical misconduct, we argue that organizations may adopt ethics hotlines for both substantive and symbolic reasons. Given that the use of hotlines by any one organization can be both substantive and symbolic, we examine several factors associated with reports of ethical misconduct to understand the conditions under which an organization uses a hotline as a symbolic gesture. We explore these questions in a dataset consisting of over 75,000 reports of ethical misconduct. Our results suggest that organizations adopt hotlines for both substantive and symbolic reasons, and that factors related to the person reporting the violation and those involved in the violation affect whether or not the organization responds in a substantive or symbolic way. "
2017,"The Way We Work Now: Toward a Relational Practice Theory of Network Emergence The way we work now differs significantly from the way people worked a generation ago. In a global economy that is increasingly driven by knowledge creation and innovation, knowledge sharing within and across organizations has become a necessity in order to solve todays complex problems. The notion that networks and networking are essential to modern work is well established in the organizational literature. However, we know surprisingly little about what people actually do in networks, and how they create and develop their network ties at work. Using a relational practice approach, we examine how knowledge workers accomplish work together in the new economy. Based on an ethnography of scientists working in academic labs, we find five categories of relational practices at work: helping, mentoring, apprenticing, co-creating, and coordinating. We theorize how these practices shape scientists networks throughout their career stages around different skills, foci, and objects. The relational practice perspective makes an important contribution to the network literature, which has largely focused on the structure of networks. Our agentic view of network emergence adds to existing understandings of the changing nature of work by emphasizing the increasingly entrepreneurial role of knowledge workers in negotiating access to the knowledge they need to accomplish their work. Future research needs to integrate small and big data studies to zoom in and out between relational practices and network structures."
2017,"Constructing Knowledge: Opening the Black Box in the Creation of Patents 	The study of knowledgerelated concepts has grown substantially. In response to the shift that modern economies are no longer based on manual work but rather work of the mind, scholars have advanced that knowledge management is critical in todays economy. Some have even proposed changing our view of organizations as bundles of resources to bundles of knowledge. While the knowledge has been defined loosely and broadly, many scholars have turned to patents and patent data to operationalize different variations of knowledge and attached them to inventors or the organizations they work for. Yet, few studies have studied the creation of patents to confirm whether and how patents are representations or indicators of various forms of knowledge. Even a prominent legal scholar in 1999 noted the dearth of research when he described patents as outputs of a black box. This study addresses this fundamental gap in our understanding and illuminates the participants, subprocesses, and interfaces in the creation of this important artifact. Findings indicate patents are produced in four phases by an unfolding cast of participants who interface within and across organizational boundaries. They draw from three subworlds, technical, legal, and commercial, to shape an evolving idea into a patent, a legal document with rights. These participants comprise an occupational field that disbands when the process is abandoned or completed. Because some occupational participants do not wish to be attached to what they create, they and the process are hidden to those outside of social world of patenting. Findings challenge the commonly held assumptions about the meaning of patents and raise theoretical and methodological questions about our research on knowledge."
2017,"Blurring Practices for Knowledge Creation  This article explores practice changes in the process of cross-domain knowledge creation in academic research. Systems biology is an emerging field in which scientists combine laboratory experiments and computational modeling to capture system level phenomena that explain how cancer develops. Findings from an 18-month field study at two top-ranked US research universities suggest that scientists collaborated to make two diverse domain-specific practices converge around the dimensions of focus and magnitude. I call this process practice blurring and identify three microprocesses  absorbing, directing and rescaling. The conclusion that cross-domain knowledge creation requires the blurring of scientific approaches has important implications for the literature on knowledge creation, innovation process, and practice change."
2017,"Balancing Continuity and Novelty: Practical Relevance from the Practitioners' Perspective Even though the literature on practical relevance of management research holds that practitioners actively construct practical relevance, the practitioners' perspective on relevance has yet received very little scholarly attention. Drawing on practitioners' accounts on the relevance of academic concepts, this paper examines how practitioners construct academic knowledge as practically relevant. A theoretical model is developed that explains the process of practitioners relevance construction. Practitioners construct academic knowledge as relevant by (1) matching academic knowledge against their contexts and previous knowledge, (2) extending their previous knowledge by new instruments, constructs and scientific framing and (3) re-matching the extended knowledge to their contexts and professional practices. This model extends the literature on practical relevance by showing that academic knowledge balancing novelty and continuity increases practical relevance. In contrast to previous findings, it is also shown that ambiguous academic knowledge that is 'action expansive', i.e. that provides a broad range of actions, decreases the chances that practitioners construct it as relevant."
2017,"A Process Perspective on Organizational Failure: A Qualitative Meta-Analysis The question of how and why organizations fail has received considerable attention in literature and case studies constitute a substantial part of the research designs used. Yet, little academic work has been conducted to synthesize evidence from existing case studies on the processes of organizational failure. Based on a qualitative meta-analysis of 42 longitudinal cases studies, we identified four process archetypes of organizational failure: the disruption, the obedience, the illegitimacy, and the paradox track. We explore the relations between these four process archetypes by proposing a process taxonomy of organizational failure. Our process taxonomy extends current theory by suggesting more integrated process explanations and by identifying two rather overlooked patterns of organizational failure."
2017,"(Un)happy Endings? Exploring the Crossover Effects of Operational and Relational Failures This paper reconciles a theoretical tension between conflicting perspectives regarding the impact of operational failures on organizational outcomes. It does so by forwarding the possibility that failures play a dual role, one that is more harmful and one that promotes positive outcomes. Departing from the traditional research in this domain that focuses prevalently on how individual organizations respond to failures, we explore whether and how failures experienced by one organization influence organizations that maintain exchange relationships with the stricken organization. Findings show that experience with major operational failures will produce negative impacts that extend beyond the boundaries of the stricken organization eventually leading its partners to depart from existing alliances. Yet, this process of preferential detachment does not occur in the face of minor operational failures. Interestingly, the paper also finds support for the possibility that stricken organizations may derive positive outcomes from major failures as well, in the form of increased stability of post- accident alliances. Contributions to alliance dynamics and failures literatures are discussed."
2017,"Safe Distance to the Wreck Site: Organizational Failure and Intra-Professional Status Changes This paper explores boundary conditions of intra-professional status loss in the wake of organizational failure. Extant research shows organizational failure to be a powerful source of status loss, but in this paper we propose that mechanisms of status loss are contingent on characteristics of the industry, organization and failure in question. We build a theoretical argument for mechanisms safeguarding employees from suffering diminishing cumulative career advantages, and empirically test our theorizing. We propose that industry institutions can increase employee bargaining power post organizational failure, and that employees in industries relying heavily on relational capital experience decreased risk of stigmatization. We further propose that employees situated in managerial positions or employed in subsidiaries geographically and organizationally proximate to the cause of the organizational failure benefit less from these mechanisms than other employees. The sudden failure of the marked leading oil reseller OW Bunker offers an excellent natural experiment for testing our hypotheses. Based on unique hand collected quantitative data on 207 key employees and interviews with 21 industry participants we find support for our theorizing. We interpret this as an indication that when key audiences have no instrumental interest in penalizing a group at risk of stigmatization, the increased risk does not manifest as a general status loss, but rather status loss occurs based on rational considerations of culpability."
2017,"Mindful Failure Cycle in High Reliability Organizations:The Role of Failure in Achieving Success This article theorizes that, in contrast to established High Reliability Organization (HRO) theory that claims high performance results from a preoccupation with failure, HROs perform reliably because failures are compartmentalizednot fixated upon. We theorize that a mindful failure cycle allows frontline operators to move-on from failing in hot- failure contexts in order to tackle the next emerging challenge without distraction until time permits for reflection and learning in a cold-failure context. This differentiation between moving-on from failure verses being obsessed with failureis an important distinction in how HROs achieve reliable organizational performance despite the complexity of their tasks, the unpredictability of their operating environments, and the danger inherent in their work. Through the introduction of this new process model, the study explores the interrelatedness between individual mindfulness at the micro-level and organizational success at the macro-level providing a more nuanced analysis of the relationship between failure and high performance in HROs and offers insights transferable to other less risky reliability-seeking organizations."
2017,"Storytelling, Mindfulness and High-Reliability Organizing How is a conventionally structured bureaucratic public-sector organization that is highly standardized, hierarchical, formalized, and specialised in its operations, nevertheless sufficiently mindful to achieve high reliability? Our answer is that mindfulness is in part, constituted discursively in the form of streams of stories told by organizational members associated with officially sanctioned organizing frames. Based on an in-depth analysis of the Environment Agency (EA), the mission of which is to protect and improve the environment in England, we show how heedful interrelating occurred through shared discursive frames which martialled communal stories, and how these frames and stories sensitized people to their environment, prompted them continuously to question assumptions, synthesized consonant sensemaking, and facilitated coordinated collective action. The EA, we argue, is a reliability seeking organization, which, in common with other institutions that need effectively to cope with the demands of complex, ambiguous, dynamic environments while engaged in time-critical tasks, needed mindfully to operate to minimize error. Storytelling, we argue, is mindfulness in action."
2017,"Once A Star, Always A Star? Status Attainment of Cross-Border New Entrants in Creative Industries Despite the wealth of research on the antecedents of status, we know little about the mechanisms that affect ability of individuals in one market to attain status in another market. The issues of cross-market status transfer are especially salient in the creative industries (e.g. movie-making, fashion or art) that are characterized by intensive cross-country talent mobility. We combine research on status and typecasting to explain the mechanisms causing some new entrants from a foreign country to lose or gain status in a host country relative to other new entrants. We find that low-status new entrants gain status relative to high-status new entrants. We also find that low-status generalist new entrants gain status relative to high-status generalist new entrants. We develop these insights through the analysis of an original dataset on the status attainment of Chinese movie actors in the Hong Kong film industry."
2017,"To The Manner Born: How Earned Status And Inherited Status Influence Conformity How status affects conventionality is a question with a long tradition in sociology and organization theory. The bulk of this literature focuses on how earned status, that is the status that is acquired through recognition and deference by peers or audiences, affects actors conventionality. Literature in social psychology has shown however, that actors also inherit status on the basis of ascribed characteristics (such as gender or nationality). We investigate how the inconsistency between the status actors earn and the status they inherit affect their propensity to adopt conventional choices. We suggest, as we detail in our study, that the status inconsistency for low-status actors from a high-status group prompts a different behavior than status inconsistency for high-status actors from a low-status group. We study the role of status inconsistency on the repertoire choice of conductors of the major US orchestras between 1896 and 1970. We find that high status conductors from low status countries are more likely, than their peers from high status countries, to play compositions that are more adopted in the field. As different from this, low status actors from high status countries are more likely to play unconventional compositions than their peers from low status countries."
2017,"High-Status Affiliations and Task Performance: The Analysis of Categorical Alignment as a Moderator This study attempts to extend the theoretical argument on the effect of high-status affiliations and the role of audiences in the process of performance evaluation. Because the status of an actor is dependent on the context that the actor is located in, it is problematic to conclude that positive effect of high-status affiliations is constant regardless of the category-based identity of affiliating actors. I suggest that an actor's rewards from high- status affiliations are contingent on the extent to which category- based identity of the actor overlaps with that of its affiliates. Two types of audiences -conformity-seeking and novelty-seeking- are expected to draw different judgments on the category overlap between affiliating parties, moderating the effect of high-status affiliations on actor's reward. I tested the predictions by investigating the collaboration between actors and directors in the context of Korean film industry from 2006 to 2015. Confirming the earlier researches, I found that actors who collaborated with high- status directors were likely to attain greater box-office success and receive more awards than those with low-status directors. For actor's box-office success, the positive effect of directors' status was strengthened with the overlap of genre identity between them. For actor's artistic recognition, however, the favorable effect of high-status affiliations was attenuated with genre overlap."
2017,"Strengthening The Ties That Bind: Similarity, Status and Uncertainty in Film Production  Studies of collaboration have highlighted the importance of similarity as a driver of tie formation, however, we seldom know when this driver breaks down. Prior literature offers two forces as likely suspects when searching for dampener of the influence of similarity on the choice of a collaborator: perceived environmental uncertainty and partner status. Prior studies of uncertainty have highlighted that it creates a tension that can be adressed in two opposed way by managers: either they look for new partners, or they tend to rely more on existing and similar partners. However, we know little about what leads the tension to be resolved one way or another. Similarly, studies of status in collaborative settings suggest it creates options for choosing new partners and a strengthened preference for working with similar others, however, it is not clear how those two tendencies play out in practice. Do high status individuals explore the collaborative options afforded to them by their status or do they display an exacerbated tendency to collaborate further with past collaborators or similar others? Individuals choose collaborators they believe are the best fit for their project. Constraints during the recruitment process---in terms of time and resources---imply that decisions are made under uncertainty on the quality of the new collaborator. As a result, project stakeholders have to rely on what they can observe. I explore how one of those observables---similarity---is used by project stakeholders while choosing collaborators. More precisely, the contribution of this paper is to highlight the boundary conditions of the preference for similarity in regard to status and uncertainty. I show that, while similarity has a positive effect on the likelihood of collaboration, status of the project stakeholder limits the influence of similarity. In addition, uncertainty at the project level heightens the reliance on similarity; while uncertainty at the market level does not influence the reliance on similarity. My data tracks technicians in the French film industry over a 14-year period, exploring the implications beyond this industry for collaboration among skilled workers and for managers involved in recruiting decisions."
2017,"Organizational Political Ideology and Corporate Responses to Activist Protest This paper argues that organizational systems tend to be more open or closed as a function of their members political ideologies, and that this variation can help explain firms responses to social protests levied against them. Integrating research in social movements with political psychology, we propose that when a firm experiences activist protest, a liberal firm will be more likely to concede to activist demands relative to a more conservative counterpart, because of greater decision-maker recognition for the interconnectedness between the firms activities and activists making claims. In contrast, a conservative firm will be more likely to counter the protest with impression-management tactics in an attempt to maintain its independence from the sociopolitical environment. We further consider how the activists structural position, in terms of representing primary versus secondary stakeholders to the firm, affect the firms ideologically-informed response to protest. We test our ideas using a longitudinal sample of protest events directed against Fortune 500 firms during 2001-2013, and a measure of organizational ideology based on individual campaign contributions by employees. Controlling for the ideological alignment of activists and firms, we find considerable support for our hypotheses."
2017,"Fighting Fire with Fire: Royal Dutch/Shell's Responses to Anti-Apartheid Activists I investigate how firms defend their organizational legitimacy in response to social movement activism. Building upon organizational impression management (OIM) research, I focus on firms defamation responses to activistsrhetoric aimed at delegitimizing activists following activists negative rhetoric against firms. Empirically, I analyze Royal Dutch/Shells responses to anti-apartheid activists pressures to divest from South Africa between 1986 and 1990. This case study offers insight into two defamation responses: (1) portrayal of activists logic for solving social issues as specious (i.e., flawed, illogical) and (2) character attacks. This paper contributes to a more complete understanding of firms responses to social movement activism by moving beyond self-focused OIM strategies to other- focused OIM strategies."
2017,"Institutional Maintenance within the Regulative Pillar There is a gap in the institutional work-literature regarding the role of the so-called regulative pillar for institutional maintenance. Understanding processes and outcomes related to this pillar are important, as they often have decisive impacts on the institutional dynamics within fields. To fill this gap, this paper draws on a case study of Swedish agri-food policy addressing climate change. By focusing on problematizations as triggers, the paper shows that policies supporting controversial practices are maintained as a redefined script that restores cognitive order is created. These case findings are then used to suggest several proposition regarding the characteristics of maintenance within the regulative pillar."
2017,"Pricing Conflict: Legal Regimes, Uncertainty, and Price in Medical Marijuana Markets How do sellers set prices in legally contested markets, which are rife with uncertainty engendered by conflicting legal regimes created by different levels of the federalist state? Although much research in economic sociology has recognized that states create markets, very little has explicitly recognized that many states are federalist systems, with nested levels of government; even less has studied how legal regimes (federalist or not) affect price-setting. Here, we build on sociological and legal scholarship to develop a theory of how legal regimes at multiple levels of government affect price-setting. We argue that conflict between levels of government increases uncertainty for sellers, which affects prices by increasing costs and hindering the development of pricing norms. We apply this theory to a legally critical battleground for federalism: state-legal markets for medical marijuana in the United States. Consistent with this theory, we find that when state-level and federal-level legal regimes conflict, marijuana prices are higher and more dispersed than when state-level and federal-level legal regimes are aligned. We also find that conflict between state and local governments results in higher and more dispersed marijuana prices. We conclude by considering how multi-level models of legal regimes might be applied to other markets."
2017,Why Won't You Listen to Me?The Role of Discursive Legitimacy during Episodes of Contention Why are some actors more listened to than others? In contrast to extant research in organization theory this paper focuses on discursive legitimation of actors rather than issues. It explores how actors from different subject positions engage in field level struggles to make their voice heard in an emerging and contested field: the public debates over shale gas exploration and exploitation in France. This article analyzes how actors claim and how the audience grants discursive legitimacy. It identifies six types of discursive (de)legitimacy claims and two types of judgment modes. This paper then proposes a process model that captures the dynamics of field level discursive legitimacy seeking and granting. With this it contributes to the discursive turn in institutional theory by conceptualizing how actors gain discursive legitimacy so as to participate in discourse over important issues or events.
2017,"Individuals' Experiences of Institutional Complexity: A Typology of Challenges to Collaboration Through a qualitative study of individuals experiences of institutional complexity in three domains of care at a U.S. academic medical center, I develop a typology of forms of institutional complexity that furthers our understanding of the range of challenges that the presence of multiple, contradictory logics presents to collaboration. I suggest that our current focus on differences and conflict between carriers of different logics obscures other sources of tensions that may illuminate the likelihood of collaboration in the presence of multiple, contradictory institutional logics. I also identify variation in individuals perceptions and attitudes towards institutional tensions, which suggest the possibility of a more positive role for institutional complexity in collaboration."
2017,"Responding to Institutional Complexity: Explaining the Difference between Individuals Our work aims at investigating how and why individual actors differ in their responses to institutional complexity. We do so by carrying out a qualitative study, in which we conducted two year of participant-observation and interviewed 58 employees who experienced multiple institutional logics at work on a daily basis in a global sales organization. We rely on the micro-factors of emotion, the individuals relationship with institutional context and salient identity to study how these factors trigger individual differences. We found that in the midst of institutional complexity, micro-level actors undergo four types of emotional combinations: comfortable and willing to act, uncomfortable and willing to act, uncomfortable and unable to act, and comfortable and no need to act. They invoke two types of salient identity: identify oneself with one single logic and identify oneself as between multiple logics. Depending on the combination of emotional reactions and salient identities, individuals may adopt one or more of the following responses: avoid multiple logics, force own logic, accommodate to others logics, moderate between logics, and surpass complexity of multiple logics. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we delineate how and why individual actors differ in their responses to the contradiction between institutional arrangements. Second, we bring to light the dynamic and complexity of individual agency in institutional complexity, thereby contributing to enhancing the understanding of the link between the macro and micro levels of institutions."
2017,"Responses to Institutional Complexity: Veiled vs. Visible Implementations of Contested Practices What characteristics allow organizations to manage field-level norms that discourage the adoption of innovations required to exploit new economic opportunities? In order to investigate this question, we examine the adoption of technology licensing programs among American Universities from 1980 to 2004. Although technology licensing programs represented a major source of new economic benefits for universities, the commercialization of university technologies was initially viewed as contrary to the traditional norms of education and science, which emphasize the open development and dissemination of knowledge. We incorporate neutralization theory to explain what organizational characteristics influence the strategic adoption of socially contested practices. We test our predictions using a longitudinal data set on all universities at risk of adopting technology commercialization practices in the U.S. from 1980 to 2004. Overall, our findings suggest that while economic factors appear to similarly motivate major research universities to adopt licensing programs, the availability of strategies to neutralize social stigma is associated with whether universities implement full technology licensing offices or less visible variations."
2017,"Multiple Logics and Organizational Responses under Macro-environment Uncertainties Multiple logics exist within organizational fields. They set up organizing principles for actors, define legitimate behaviors, and specify the criteria for effectiveness and efficiency in the social life. Previous scholars mostly focus on the conflicts between multiple logics, such as conflicts among market, community, and family logics, and the institutional complexity created by those incompatible logics. By examining the merger and acquisitions of Canadian mining companies from 1986 to 2010, I find that market logic, the logic pursuing the maximization of economic profits, does not necessarily conflict with community logic, the logic emphasizing the preservation of community values. In addition, a historiography of the institutional context in Canada shows that the cross-currents in the effects of logics on firms behaviors are driven by their respectively interaction with the exogenous macro-environment. This study advances institutional theory by showing an alternative source of institutional complexity and highlighting the importance of macro-environment conditions in institutional logic research."
2017,"A Double-dimensional Behavioural Model of State-owned Enterprises Investment: Evidence from China State-owned enterprises (SOEs) active investment is a remarkable phenomenon in the business world, whereas the motivations behind this behaviour are relatively less explored. Drawing on the multiple-goal model in the behavioural theory of the firm (BTOF) and the hybrid nature of SOEs, we developed a double-dimensional behavioural model to investigate how SOEs investment is driven separately and interactively by performance feedback in both commercial and socio-political dimensions. Using longitudinal data on Chinese SOEs in the manufacturing industry, we found that SOEs investment is significantly influenced by performance feedback in the socio-political dimension. Moreover, although performance feedback in the commercial dimension does not impact SOEs investment directly, it can weaken SOEs sensitivity to the socio- political feedback. This study provides a behavioural explanation for SOEs active investment by articulating their motivations in two dimensions. Additionally, our model enriches the multiple- goal behavioural perspective by conceptualizing two dimensions of goals which are distinctively developed, and by further demonstrating how SOEs decision-making/investment responds to them differently."
2017,"Financialization and Clean Technology Innovation: The Paradox of Institutional Investor Ownership This paper examines how the rise of shareholder value orientation driven by the financialization of the economy impacts corporate environmental innovation. Specifically, we investigate whether the growth of institutional investor ownership undermined ongoing managerial efforts to enhance clean technology innovation. Drawing variations in ownership structure, industry, and regional characteristics, we investigate under which conditions such relationship between institutional ownership and clean technology innovation were mitigated or amplified. We formulate several hypotheses that we test in data on a universe of U.S.-listed firms who participated in clean technology innovation from 1990 to 2004. This paper highlights the potential limitations to market logics in corporate environmentalism by presenting the paradox of institutional investor ownership: there are somehow fundamental tensions between save for the future and innovate for the future. By bridging the gap between complexities in institutional demands in specific sectors or fields and a more general view of these dynamics, this paper contributes to an understanding of how dominant cultural forces affect the stability and transformation of particular markets."
2017,"Between State and Market: The Dual Identity of Executives and R&D; Investment We build upon and extend the institutional logics and identity literature by highlighting that the identity of those individuals who are powerful in organizations is important to understanding organizational responses to multiple institutional logics. Specifically, we argue that institutional pluralism may produce a portfolio of identities for top executives within organizations, and the relative salience of their identities is likely to influence their actions toward these different institutional logics. We situate our empirical research in the field of Chinas state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and focus on the organizational practices of R&D; investment. The SOEs are constantly confronting state and market logics in China and the top executives of these SOEs, thus, have a dual identityCEOs in the market sector and officials in the political sector. We reveal that SOEs R&D; investments are prescribed by both state and market logics and the impacts of these two logics on SOEs R&D; are contingent on the dual identity of the top executives in SOEs. The institutional logics penetrate into organizations through activating the identity of executives and eventually affect organizational practices."
2017,"The Emergence of the Crowd-based Organization: A Process View  This paper explores theoretically a novel type of organization, which aims to recurrently innovate almost exclusively through the sustained contributions of crowds. We approach the emergence of this intriguing phenomenon, the crowd-based organization, from a process perspective. Our analysis focuses on the following questions: (1) How do communities at the heart of a crowd-based organization emerge? (2) How does crowd-based organizing  a recurrent pattern of convergent crowd contributions become possible? (3) How does a crowd- based organization, despite its fluidity, acquire system-like characteristics? In our attempt to address these questions, we draw attention to value systems, in particular, conventions of worth. Our core argument is that the unconventional (in terms of its aims and form) crowd- based organization comes about through the mobilization of taken-for- granted conventions of worth. Such conventions, we show, become highly useful and are used flexibly in processes of organizational emergence. The papers main contribution is to outline a model of the process dynamics, which constitute and continuously modify the crowd-based organization.	"
2017,"An Insterstitial Space for Social Innovation In this paper, drawing on an ethnographic study of the OpenIDEO community, we examine how an organization, IDEO, created and cultivated a diverse and global community to collaboratively develop solutions on grand challenges such as health, education, aging, and safety. Through inductive analysis, we identify that to foster collaborative problem-solving for social impact, IDEOs OpenIDEO team enacted three practices: temporal structuring, creating a collaborative community, and connecting participants and ideas. Drawing on the notion of interstitial space, we suggest that by enacting these practices the OpenIDEO team was able to create a community of passionate volunteers and the conditions for them to generate solutions to grand challenges. We also found that while the OpenIDEO community was successful at generating ideas, it was faced with difficulties in transforming them into social impact. We highlight two enabling conditions that were useful in helping the OpenIDEO team address these difficulties: community managers taking on the role of boundary spanners and embracing an experimental mindset. Our findings advance our understanding of how organizations can contribute to tackling grand challenges and how they might organize to foster collective action among a diverse group of passionate individuals. Our paper also participates to the new, but vibrant body of literature on open social innovation."
2017,"A Theoretical Perspective on Social Capital to Sustain Open Communities. This paper develops a theoretical approach to explain how social capital  cognitive, relational and structural  affects long-term sustainability of open communities. Organization studies have shown that social capital provides critical resources that support sharing, participation and collaboration in organizations, networks and communities. But the contextual assumptions in that research are less relevant for open communities which have unique structures and composition  i.e. global scale, high heterogeneity of members, voluntary participation, and quasi-open access to resources. Drawing from observations of global genomic data and information centers, this article argues that sustainability of open communities such as global centers, depends heavily on the establishment and leveraging of cognitive social capital, while relational and structural social capital may be designed in to bound the community, manage homogeneity and increase trust among members. Open communities should be aware of such relationships if they want to ensure long-term sustainability of their project."
2017,"Building A Collaborative Community: An Agent-Based Simulation Study A collaborative community is an emerging organizational form that is increasingly being used in knowledge-intensive environments where success depends on the ability to collaborate. We analyze how community member composition influences the development of a collaborative community with two kinds of members: problem providers and problem solvers. In an agent-based simulation study, we examine how the dynamics and survival of a collaborative community are affected by: (a) the initial number of agents of each kind and (b) the types and levels of skills agents possess. The simulation results show an early drop in the number of community members followed by continued growth in community size. Independent of the number of members of each kind at the formation of the community, the number of members of both kinds is approximately the same during the growth phase. The communitys growth rate depends on agent skills (both type and quality). The results suggest that homogeneous communities experience a small drop in the number of members during the early phase. Heterogeneous communities show a larger drop early on, but tend to converge to a higher average agent skill level than a homogeneous community. Sensitivity analyses demonstrate that the simulation results are consistently robust. Our use of the simulation method allows us to explain the behavior of a collaborative community over time, and we discuss the implications of our findings for building collaborative communities."
2017,"Not Your Average Cup OJoe: Constructing New Conceptions of Value in the Coffee Category In this study of the evolution of specialty coffee, I examine how new conceptions of value were created within the institutionalized constrains of a well-established category. Drawing on a sociomaterial lens, I find that relevant market actors collectively engaged in a series of evaluative practices that allowed them to negotiate issues related to expectations, relevant criteria and assessments; to enrich the repertoire of tools and vocabularies for evaluation; and to compile affect-laden narratives of the producers and their craft. In this way, market actors rearranged the relative importance of the categorys key attributes and thus shaped the boundaries of the category as a whole."
2017,"Categories in Context: Exploring the Determinants of Category Viability Socially shared categories are sources of conformity and stability for organizational phenomena, but categories also emerge, change, and fall out of use. To better understand why some categories are more or less viableable to function effectively as a boundary objectwe provide a framework for analyzing category viability as a function of a categorys context and content. In particular, we highlight the importance of the distinctiveness and coherence of categories, and identify threats of fragmentation, alienation, attenuation, and absorption that occur when the distinctiveness or coherence of a category shift away from a categorys zone of viability. We further suggest several factors that moderate category distinctiveness and coherence, and describe the implications of our framework for studies on the role of categories."
2017,"Good Collectors & Good Investors: Gatekeeper Use of Valorous Categories in the Art Market This research examines intermediary use of categories at the micro- social level, highlighting the links between categories and gatekeeping. Use of membership categorization analysis (MCA) concepts with ethnomethodology helps to show categorical micro-foundations of intermediation in talk and text. In the case of gatekeepers (gallerists) in the high value art market, thematic analysis highlights ideal-type good collectors and newer good investors, and gallerist strategies to push buyers to conform to one of these categories, often with the goal of discouraging disruptive speculation. The findings show: first, how ideal categories serve as reference points for legitimate and even valorous behavior, providing a discursive socialization tool; second, illegitimate categories and problem behaviors provide a moral basis for value- protecting gatekeeping, and; third, how recognized categories underlie dealers gatekeeping, sorting and allocation, practices seen as fair and necessary for professional practice in value-enhancing gatekeeping. The paper extends our understanding of intermediaries at a micro-social level, identifies productive connections between categories and gatekeeping research, and provides exciting methodological suggestions for micro- social categories research."
2017,"The Emergence of New Market Categories in Stigmatized Industries: The Case of E-cigarettes How do new market categories emerge in stigmatized industries? To address this question, we use a historical case study approach to analyze the emergence of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) as a new market category in the stigmatized US tobacco cigarette industry. The study reveals category emergence as a contested process, involving interactions between multiple social groups, each with a different frame of reference. Findings also highlight a paradox  entrepreneurial efforts to sanitize, also activate forces that stigmatize. Overall, the new market category emerges through the contestation between these two forces. We discuss the implications of these findings for literatures on categories, stigmatized industries, and entrepreneurship."
2017,"Institutional Reproduction: The Presence of Moral Perturbation & Dynamics of Emotional Investment How and why do actors continue to contribute to the reproduction of extant institutional arrangements, even after they have become morally perturbed by these arrangements? Through ethnographic research in eleven Pentecostal churches in urban Java, we found that when certain church practices morally perturbed church employees and volunteers in our research sites, they evoked moral emotions of guilt and anger that triggered institutional instability. However, organizational leaders exerted fear and respect-eliciting systemic power that made these actors discontinue any disrupting activities. Suppressing any impetus for institutional disruption and change, systemic power engendered actors feelings of helplessness. Bringing back power into neo-institutionalism, we investigate the boundary conditions to the mobilizing potential of moral emotions. Rather than exiting the field, actors appeared to engage in reconciling activities, enabling them to shift the anchor of their emotional investment. In our case, the shift took place from idealized institutional arrangements to a more spiritual meaning system. We argue that anchor relocation is vital to the sustainable reproduction of institutional arrangements of which actors morally disapprove."
2017,"A Man Is Known by His Cup: Signaling Commitment via Costly Conformity Why do unpopular norms persist? Existing approaches see this issue as an information problem, where individuals misconstrue a norm as popular and conform so as to fake their endorsement. But even when actors know of a norms unpopularity, conformity often seems to continue. My theory and evidence identify when and why individuals conform to such a visibly unpopular norm by focusing on the need to signal commitment in relationships. While navigating uncertainties in relationships, actors often need to discern whether their relationship partners are committed to collective interests over their individual interests. In this context, a conformist to a visibly unpopular norm appears willing even to violate her personal interest to meet a behavioral standard set out by the community (i.e., norm). Therefore, conformity to a visibly unpopular norm signals greater commitment to collective interests than does nonconformity. I leverage the case of a visibly unpopular norm around drinking in after-hour gatherings in South Korea and show that such costly conformity credibly signals commitment. A macro implication is that an unpopular norm might persist not despite its unpopularity, but precisely because of its (visible) unpopularity."
2017,"A Present Past: The Fallacy of Institutional Maintenance The idea that institutions are functions of complex processes that evolve gradually over long periods is taken-for-granted. In spite of this, our understanding of the past and how it informs current institutional configurations remains under-theorized. Where work exists, it tends to be overly literaltreating the past as a sequence of path-dependent, static events. In contrast, we theorize the past as a fluid resource (more stable or more fragile) that is interpreted in the present. The resulting model situates institutions both synchronically in nested hierarchies and diachronically in layers of sediment. We augment this model with a case-study of an essential U.S. institution (constitutional law) and the organization that embodies it (the Supreme Court). In particular, we analyze two Court decisions that define the constitutionality of the death penalty and reveal two conflict mechanisms (subversion in the present and excavation of the past) that must combine in order for change to occur. From this analysis, we derive a second, generalizable model that challenges current conceptualizations of the processes associated with maintenance and change. Specifically, we conclude that institutional maintenance, as currently theorized, is a myth. In reality, the only way institutions can be maintained is if they constantly change."
2017,"Putting It To The Test: Emergent Recoupling Through a Process of Validation  In any organization, the relationship between formal policies and actual practices is often relatively loose to allow for necessary variations in practice. Whenever policies and practices are brought in alignment, extant research conceptualizes this as a process of recoupling in which managers force workers to change their local practices to align them with formal policies. In this study we theorize and empirically illustrate that there is also an emergent form of recoupling in which workers themselves engage in various activities to align policy and practice. We show that this emergent recoupling occurs through a process of validation. Our in-depth field study at a specialized healthcare organization reveals that in this validation process, deviations in practice are scrutinized through informal and formal mechanisms such as discussions and tests to see whether new practices improve policy. The outcome of this validation process can be either progressive or regressive, depending on whether it suggests that new practice or the existing policy is superior. We contribute to the literature by introducing the concept of emergent recoupling and by demonstrating the micro-processes through which it occurs."
2017,"Whether and When to Swim with Sharks This study explores whether firms should collaborate with other powerful firms in the same market and, if so, when. This study bridges the gap on the existent mixed arguments about whether to collaborate with powerful firms by examining and contrasting two distinct signaling mechanisms V social status and market power and by exploring the moderating effect of self-reproducing complementary role on the relation between signaling mechanisms and inter-firm collaboration. Using empirical context of the syndicated underwritings within the U.S. investment banks from 1998 to 2015, the results of this study show that firms, especially the lower social status ones, are more likely to collaborate with other higher social status firms when social status is seen as a signal of cooperation. Also the results indicate that firms, especially the lower market power ones, are less likely to partner with other high market power firms when market power is thought of a signal of competition. Most importantly, the results demonstrate that a firms self-reproducing role in complementarity could enhance the signaling effect of social status on the formation of collaboration but decrease the signaling effect of market power on the formation of collaboration."
2017,"Partner Selection and Trust in Inter-organizational Relationships Partner selection constitutes an important impact factor for the course of inter-organizational relationships, as it may function as a distinct control mechanism that builds the initial foundation for the subsequent relationship and its governance. In this study, we examine how selection effort as well as selection criteria (relational and endowment-based) impact the development of diverse trust dimensions in the subsequent relationship. Analyses of 210 international inter- organizational relationships reveal heterogeneous effects that vary under different levels of country-level institutional support. Our findings allow conclusions on partner selection as a distinct governance mechanism and trust antecedent and add to the discussion on the relationship between control mechanisms and trust."
2017,"Performance in the Open. How Operational Transparency Affects Interorganizational Trust Development In interorganizational relationships, trust acts as coping mechanism for incomplete information. As organizations interact over time, the primary form of trust shifts from calculative to relational; trust is increasingly based on experience rather than economic calculus. The recent introduction of information technologies that increase transparency of operational processes across the partners in relationships reduces information asymmetries. This multiple case study of six industrial buyer-supplier dyad types investigates the resulting changes in interorganizational trust composition. My findings indicate that competence-based trust is replaced by automated performance control in the short- to medium-term and that goodwill-based trust is constantly measured against this performance control. Moreover, parts of goodwill-based trust, namely openness and honesty, are automated into the IT-system and become controllable. These changes in trust composition are accompanied by a newly emergent institutional trust into the transparency-inducing IT-system. These developments are not symmetrical; customer trust in suppliers is clearly changing while the composition of supplier trust towards customers is stable. I contribute to theory by delineating the relationship between increased operational transparency, interorganizational trust and control. My findings provide a more nuanced view into the trust-control nexus in the interorganizational governance literature, challenge the long-term orientation of interorganizational trust development theories and have implications for social network management."
2017,"A Blind Spot in Research on Inter-Organizational Collaboration? Modes of Network Resourcing The present paper argues for the importance of a resourcing perspective on inter-organizational networks. Many previous works elaborate on the potential benefits of networks, their structural arrangements and practices of inter-organizational collaboration. However, little systematic knowledge exists that explains how networks acquire or even produce the resources needed to enact this form of organizing. For instance, network structures and practices that enable the governance of and exchange in networks consume resources such as money, personnel and time. Against this background, this conceptual work proposes four ideal modes of network resourcing: all- member resourced networks, single-member resourced networks, third-party resourced networks and cash-flow resourced networks. Furthermore, antecedents for the use of each mode of resourcing and propositions about its consequences are developed. Finally, the evolution of network resourcing is discussed."
2017,"Managing Resource Dependence at Multiple Levels Managing external resource dependence is crucial for organizational performance. Yet, how organizations evaluate resource dependencies is relatively unexplored. This study examines how organizations come to know their resource dependencies by studying how people within organizations understand and respond to external dependencies. Specifically, the study incorporates individual subjectivity into resource dependence theory to better understand how peoples evaluations of dependence map onto firm-level responses to resource dependence. Drawing on fieldwork from nine urban primary schools, I find evidence people use the community boundary as a proxy to distinguish between different types of dependence. That is, rather than measure dependence with each firm, people categorize organizations as within or outside the schools community, and then assign dependence as symbiotic or competitive based on their perception of the environment overall. One implication is that different evaluations of dependence co- exist within the same organization. Mapping to the firm level, I find heterogeneous evaluations can make it difficult for organizations to respond to dependence, but four of the nine schools sampled were able to unify and successfully manage dependence despite internal heterogeneity by pursuing balanced strategies that addressed both competitive and symbiotic relationships simultaneously. Based on these findings, a multi-level theoretical resource dependence framework is proposed."
2017,"Collective Action in Context: A Multi-level Analysis of Movember Teams Effectiveness Research on team dynamics has studied the influences of cultural diversity, communication styles, status and reputation differences, authority, and the division of labor on team effectiveness and innovation. What has been largely overlooked has been a deeper investigation into how teams manage internal diversity alongside environmental complexity and are affected by contextual factors in the communities and regions in which they operate; we also know relatively little about whether similar team dynamics that are common in firms and other conventional organizations apply similarly to organizations advocating change in society (i.e. Social Movement Organizations). To address these questions, we build from a large-scale geographic database of SMO-linked teams that provides evidence of their effectiveness in generating participant fundraising, focusing on how team dynamics are conditioned by contextual factors such as the levels of community civic engagement, the role of large employers, and the socio-demographic characteristics of local residents. Evidence comes from micro-level individual and team participation data from the Movember campaign, a large-scale advocacy effort intended to raise awareness of (and funds for research on) prostate cancer. We find that teams that are homogeneous in their motivations for participation, distributed, and active on social media tend to be more effective in fundraising; zooming out to the community-level, we find that community factors related to resources, political opportunities, and the presence of large employers all increase team fundraising. This research contributes to organizational theory on team dynamics, as well as to theory and research on social movement teams and broader contextual influences on social movement organizations."
2017,"The Emergence of Resourcing Practices in Epistemic Communities: The Case of Drug Repurposing Valuable resources are key drivers of firm performance. Yet, little is known about the process whereby resources obtain value. By looking at a specific setting in drug discovery in the pharmaceutical industry known as drug repurposing, we analyze antecedents of the systematic process whereby resources obtain value. Our findings show that emergence of an alternative problem solving logic and changing practices interact with systematic efforts of resourcing, and technology had a significant impact on increase in resourcing practices. In the process of emergence of alternative logics and changing practices, serendipity had a dual role as a historical case study and a narrative in the emergence of a new paradigm in drug discovery known as drug repurposing."
2017,"Bringing a Resource to Life: An Action-oriented Ontology of Resources Although resources have occupied an important role in theories of strategic management, scholars have not sufficiently theorized the internal processes of a resource. In contrast to treating the resource itself as a black box, we theorize resources as a living concept in which actors transform potential resources (objects) into resources. We start by developing an action-oriented ontology of a resource. This formulation proposes that actors, via their actions, engage in meaning making and meaning enactment that bring potential resources to life as resources. We then propose a four-component model of resourcing that unpacks the process of resource emergence based on actions, actor characteristics, object characteristics, and environment characteristics. We conclude by explaining the implications for strategic management."
2017,"External Pressures and Organizational Learning from Serious Errors: Evidence from Major Oil Spills When studying organizational learning from serious errors, existing research has largely focused on the influences of organizational characteristics and event-specific factors. In contrast, few studies address the potential impact of the external environment on organizational learning from such events. In this study, we bridge this gap by investigating how organizational learning after serious errors is shaped by reactions from security analysts, a critical external audience to public companies. Building on the theories of organizational learning and the research on security analysts, we argue that analysts influences on companies learning from errors can be complicated. As expert intermediaries who also evaluate companies based on categorical and institutional norms, analysts adjust their expectations over time according to the companies current performance and the emergence of new information, which can engender different types of pressures that have distinct, sometimes even contradictory, effects on organizational learning from serious errors. One the one hand, analysts event-specific pressure after serious errors, reflected in their negative evaluations, can facilitate organizational learning from such events. On the other hand, their more immediate demands and expectations on companies financial performance can lead to higher likelihood of subsequent organizational errors, because such pressure increases managers propensity to myopic behaviors and shifts organizations attention away from safety and failure prevention. Empirically, the analyses of major oil spills records of the oil and gas companies in the U.S. from 1980 to 2016 confirmed our hypotheses. This study contributes to the organizational learning literature by bringing attention to the complicated role of external actors. Our findings on the competing pressures from analysts also advance the understanding of the organizational oscillation between learning and forgetting after serious errors."
2017,"Myopic Organizational Learning from Accidents In this study we argue that experiencing accidents does not always guarantee organizational learning. Rather, having a specific type of accident leads to an increase in other types, since the experience diverts organizational attention and resources away from preventing other types of accidents. We test our argument in the setting of the gas transmission pipeline industry in the United States from 2002 to 2013. We find that after pipelines had experienced accidents due to human error, operators were more likely to have accidents that did not involve human error. We also find a myopic learning effect, which is exacerbated by enforcement actions but attenuated when a firms performance is below aspirations."
2017,"The World as a Casino: Bandit Models in Strategy and Organization Science Research Strategic management researchers use multi-armed bandit model simulations to study organizational learning in, for example, strategy implementation and investment choices. We criticize that previous studies used oversimplifications in the simulated task environment and assumed decision rules that neither reflect optimal nor actual behavior. By means of Monte Carlo simulations and conceptual considerations, we show that these issues severely limit generalizations of research findings. For example, decision rules intended to prescribe optimal behavior in previous studies are outperformed by a Bayesian bandit approach that we use in our simulations. Overall, our findings suggest that greater caution should be used when researchers derive practical implications from bandit model simulations. We use these findings to derive recommendations for future use of bandit models in strategy and organization science research."
2017,"Knowledge Diversity, Organizational Learning and Performance Research on organizational learning emphasizes how organizations learn and improve their performance as their members interact to exchange and recombine their diverse knowledge. This emphasis on the benefits of exchanging and recombining diverse knowledge hinges on the assumption that the performance landscape over which individuals learn has a single peak and that learning from better performing individuals is always beneficial in the long run. If we relax this assumption and allow for the possibility that conflicting constraints affect learning, then the benefits of exchanging and recombining diverse knowledge are less obvious. Conflicting constraints make the performance landscape multi-peaked, so increasing the chance of producing re-combinations of little or no use. To examine when knowledge diversity enhances or harms organizational performance, we developed a computational model of organizational learning in which individuals with diverse knowledge are located on different peaks of the performance landscape. The model shows that in the presence of conflicting constraints knowledge diversity does not always improve organizational performance over time. The structure of the performance landscape over which learning unfolds is indeed critical for establishing when recombining diverse knowledge is beneficial. We discuss the implications of our findings for research on organizational learning, and expose model extensions that represent viable avenues for future research."
2017,"Producing Prescriptive Knowledge in Management Research: A New Perspective on Tribalism The management research community maintains that management scholars should conclude theoretical progress in journal articles by offering managerial prescriptions. In this way, prescriptions serve as a proxy for advancing management research forward as an applied science. The poor production of prescriptions has been explained by tribalism, which suggests that some philosophy and method approaches provide superior foundations. Do they? We examined this issue by studying publication data from a management research program. We uncover how tribalism can unexpectedly unfold as a symbiotic knowledge process generated not by one dominant but by five complementary prescriptive-based tribes. We synthesize prior theories on this emergent process into a perspective that suggests new research directions on tribalism in the applied science of management research."
2017,"Field Interconnectedness and Strategic Action in South-African Higher Education The goal of our paper is to provide an account of the relationships between the inter-linkages with proximate fields and strategic action in organizational fields across periods of stability, contention and settlement. We move beyond the extant literature on external jolts by proposing that inter-field linkages are relevant to explain strategic action in periods of stability and conflict. More specifically, we analyse the inter-linkages between the field of power, a term adopted by Bourdieu to emphasise the state as a social field, and the university field in South Africa before, during and after the breakdown of the Apartheid regime, and the strategic action of two universities, which can be portrayed as incumbent and challenger within the field, by comparing their strategies and responses to external influences across cases and over time. In this way, we provide one of the few empirical analyses of how inter-field linkages are differentially mobilized by actors within a field depending on their position in the field hierarchy and their possession of resources. We also show that the strategies of actors in periods of conflict are not singular, isolated incidents but are related to strategies undertaken in previous periods of stability and future periods of settlement."
2017,"Ontological assumptions, drifts, and relevance of knowledge in strategy research  The question about relevance of knowledge produced by strategy research to practitioners has been a subject of serious reflection of scholars, with growing realization that it should be addressed at the level of basic assumptions. Indeed, ontological and epistemological assumptions are consequential the way research is done; the different ontological orientations entail different ways of theorizing, and thus, should be also consequential for relevance of the knowledge produced in research for practitioners. Yet the question of how the basic ontological and epistemological assumptions of researchers influence the relevance of the knowledge produced has not been explicitly addressed. In this paper we explore the relationship between ontological assumptions strategy scholars make and relevance of research to practitioners. We demonstrate that different ontological assumptions dictate different logics of action - logics that guide the central questions of strategy practitioners  what a firm should do next. We also demonstrate role of ontological drifts - failures to maintain epistemic-ontological alignment  in achieving relevance. We use the case of an emergent academic field  business models  to illustrate our claims. We show that engaging in ontological drifts allows signalling commitment to the established within strategic management entitative worldview with predictable and controllable outcomes based on logic of causation, while effectively exploring how successful outcomes can occur through control-oriented approaches that may essentially be non-predictive consistent with effectuation logic. We thus show that ontological drifts are not only unfortunate mistakes detrimental for construct clarity, but in fact fulfil an important function of achieving relevance."
2017,"Changing Organizational Reputation in Management Consulting Despite a growth of work on building, managing and rehabilitating organizational reputation, we know relatively little about how organizations can effectively change their reputations. Through studying the case of a global management consulting firm, we show how firms with positive reputations can change their reputations despite resistance from different stakeholders. We find that particular organizational factors comprising of legitimated expertise, relevant celebrity and strong relationships as well as institutional conditions such as the knowledge of clients, competition environment and firm history can enable organizations to change their reputations. A significant contribution of this paper is to show how firms with established reputations can overcome the burden of reputation stickiness through satisfying certain organizational factors and institutional conditions."
2017,"Status Rebellion: When Lower Status Firms Differentiate Pro Bono Reward Strategy In studying organizational adaptation, past research has demonstrated that an actors status produces distinctive motivation for organizational conformity. However, the current literature provides little explanation about behavioral decisions when an actors understanding of social standing is ambiguous. By taking a dyadic perspective, this study investigates how inter-firm status similarity affects management differentiation. Using the empirical context of the U.S. law firm pro bono reward policy expansion, I show that a law firm makes a distinctive decision in reward program design according to its relative status position with respect to its market competitors. When a law firm realizes lower status compared to its competitor, the firm tends to imitate the reward policy of the higher status competitor. However, without a clear distinction in status hierarchy, a lower status firm is more prone to differentiate its reward program with respect to its higher status rival. Furthermore, I show that the influence of status similarity is moderated by the common audience shared by rival firms. If two law firms share common corporate clients, the positive effect of status similarity on differentiation is dramatically increased."
2017,"Cross-National Variation in Occupational Prestige This article investigates cross-national differences in occupational prestige amongst French, American and Canadian privacy officers. Privacy officers design and implement programs to protect private information in organizations. As a consequence, members of the privacy occupation serves as key interfaces between organizations and their information environments. The current study seeks to extend structuralist theories of occupational prestige- which suggest that all complex societies engender similar hierarchies of occupations. In contrast, in my chosen empirical case of privacy officers, I find that national contexts accord varying degrees of prestige to the privacy occupation. On the one hand, American privacy officers are upwardly mobile and endowed with the potentiality of being strategic organizational actors. On the other, French privacy officers are low-status actors- largely relegated to documentation and compliance tasks. Using a comparative case study method and a multimodal data corpus (interviews, newspaper articles, professional communication and interaction) I construct a model of occupational prestige. I theorize that national regulatory, cultural and institutional structures combine to produce differing perceptions of risk, ambiguity and uncertainty. Such organizational perceptions meaningfully affect occupational sensemaking-sensegiving patterns, and as a consequence, occupational prestige. Overall, I make a case for extending the insights from the study of occupations (and professions) to emergent knowledge-work contexts."
2017,"Building Relationships Between a Market Logic and Multiple Logics in Complex Institutional Settings Research in institutional logics tends to neglect to emphasize how logics relate to one another when enacted by interacting actors. We explore how variants of a market logic enacted by private firms relate to an array of public sector logics when the firms aim to commercialize innovative welfare solutions in healthcare. Two findings are obtained: First, conflicting or convergent logics relationships are continuously built between a market logic and different public sector logics. Second, the logics relationships influence the firms space for actions: Where some firms focus on commercializing in their home market other firms shift focus to international markets depending on whether their market logic has a convergent or conflicting relationship with public sector logics in their home market. The findings contribute to institutional logics theory by refining our understanding of how different relationships between logics develop continuously and enable actors to take different forms of actions."
2017,"Organizational Hybridity Influence on Competitive Strategies and Behaviour: the Azorean Case This paper investigates whether organizational hybridity influences organizations competitive strategies and behaviour. We follow a comparative multi-case study design, where the competitive strategies and behaviour of a social-commercial hybrid organization are compared and contrasted to the ones of a commercial organization (non-hybrid). The empirical context of this study is the dairy market of the Azorean island Sao Miguel. The results reveal that hybrid organizations that instantiate conflicting logics experience tensions at the strategic positioning level, where conflicting logics push towards different prescriptions about the adequate strategies to follow. This might lead to strategic lock-in, meaning that a particular strategy is pursued, not because it is the most desired one, but because internal conflicting logics push towards opposing strategic choices. The results also support that hybrid organizations are able to apply soft decoupling strategies, which implies the decoupling of their competitive behaviour from their organizational form, in order to send credible signals to market constituents. This paper contributes to foster our knowledge about hybrid organizations, and also about he role of institutional forces on organizations strategic choices."
2017,"States Rationalizations: Analyzing Policy Decisions in the Electricity Infrastructure This paper argues for the special nature of the logic of the state (LOS) amongst other societal level logics. It does this through a qualitative/comparative case study, relying mainly on participant observation in a legal firm, and in the Supreme Court of Pakistan. The paper compares two cases where the state tried to address rampant electricity shortage in Pakistan, in 2008-09, by installing electricity generation plants. This was done through private participation in Case 1 and through the public sector in Case 2. Both of these policies were challenged in the Supreme Court  but on different accounts. The former for undue haste and the later for unnecessary delay. Our analysis explains this paradox, arguing that the state logic is a complex phenomenon constituted through accommodation of multiple societal logics. This special nature allows actors to invoke various logics at various stages of the projects, in order to influence states policies and actions. Contributions are thus made to the theory of logic of state by elaborating various symbols and practices which pertain to mutually competing conceptualizations of the logic of state, and by explaining how this complex nature of LOS has a bearing on its policies and decisions."
2017,"What's the Benchmark? Media and Valuation in the Luxury Watchmaking Industry This paper argues that, within a well-established industry, the medias general discourse partly determines consumers perceptions of how comparable producers are to one another. That is, within a given industry, the overall structure of co- mentions of a producers name with its competitors within these media reports influences the readers perceptions about that producers comparability to its competitors. In turn, such perceptions of comparability of a producer to its competitors are positively associated to consumers valuations for that producers products due to a closer fit with the category prototype (i.e. the category member most similar to all others). Using media reports on the luxury watchmaking industry between 2001 and 2009, I find a positive effect of a watch producers comparability on the prices reached by its watches in auctions. This relationship is positively moderated by both the absolute level of watch experts monetary valuations of these watches and the uncertainty of those valuations, as these factors impact the likelihood that consumers will rely upon that structure of comparisons."
2017,"Pride Cometh before a Fall: When High-status Actors Engage in Projects of Great Magnitude This study explores the dynamics of the Matthew effect in the creative industries. We suggest that high-status organizations are able to realize more financial and status benefits for demonstrating the same level of quality as their low-status counterparts. However, we also suggest that high-status organizations might fail to achieve all the potential advantages of their position in the status hierarchy when they implement a project of great magnitude, because of the incongruence between status and magnitude. Analyzing a unique dataset compiled from three different sources in the video game industry, we find support for our hypotheses. We discuss the implications for both theory and practice."
2017,"Fashion Power: Status Transfer and Price Drawing on the sociology of fashion literature and the institutional evolution of the fashion industry and its leading fashion houses, we argue that the remarkable longevity of leading houses is a function of institutions that permit fashion houses to use status transfer strategies to straddle high- and low-end markets. Toward a more general framework for making sense of and using these institutional arrangements, we develop the concept of fashion power and observe four factors that support legal coordination among competitors: (1) coordinating predictions about near-in demand trends, (2) sharing the power to reflect industry history and achievements, (3) cultivating third-party gatekeepers of perspective, and (4) controlling boundaries for organize the geography of production. By affiliating themselves with the avant-garde and the elites, high fashion firms profit from status transfer towards a mass market which allows to charge high price margins."
2017,"New Luxury: Examining the Maintenance of Elite Status The importance of status is well established in research on management and organization theory (e.g., Podolny, 1993; Washington & Zajac, 2005). Despite the benefits associated with high status, its consequentiality to commercial success, and emerging evidence that brings the apparent stability of status orders into question (e.g., Delmestri & Greenwood, 2016), scholars still know little about how status dynamics occur (Piazza & Castellucci, 2014: 309). In this study, I consider the possibility that status may be actively maintained and agentically renegotiated over time, even by those in favored, elite positions. I conduct an in-depth, inductive case study of the luxury segment of the U.S. hotel industry from 1985-2015, using both qualitative and quantitative analyses to uncover how members of this high- status segment collectively maintained their industry rank and cultural prestige over time. I show that linguistic efforts at sacralization, emotional recasting, and preservation constituted an extended process of collective cultural entrepreneurship (Wry, Lounsbury, & Glynn, 2011) that focused on revising the collective meanings ascribed to hotel luxury and maintaining the segments high status (DiMaggio, 1982). My findings advance research on status orders and, in particular, elite status, newly revealing the manners in which it is maintained, and they establish the role that cultural entrepreneurship plays therein."
2017,"CFO Social Ties and Financial Reporting Quality: Examination of Mistake Financial Restatements In contrast to much of the focus of organizational deviance research on organizational misconduct, we theorize in this paper about the unique antecedents to organizational mistakes. Conceptualizing in the context of financial restatements, we theorize that the social ties between CFO, who has the primary responsibility of preparing financial statement, and other top executives of the firm will reduce the likelihood of mistake restatements. We further argue that the organizational information environment characteristics as defined by firm size, scope, and R&D; focus moderate this relationship. Empirical testing on publicly traded firms in the United States from 2000 to 2012 in the context of financial restatements provided broad support for this framework. We discuss implications to research on organizational deviance, upper echelons, and financial reporting."
2017,"Climbing Out or Digging Deeper: Customer Reactions to Product Recalls and Recalling Firm Responses Despite an increased focus on product recalls in the business press in recent years, management research examining product recalls and ensuing strategic outcomes has been relatively narrow in scope. Specifically, the process by which firms and their managers navigate their way through recall events has largely been left unexplored despite the importance of such management efforts in limiting the potential negative effect of the recall on performance outcomes. In this study, I leverage insights from related literatures in impression management and trust repair to develop a model detailing how the manner in which firms respond to their product recalls influences customers reactions. Specifically, firms can respond in the media by utilizing apologies, denials, excuses, and justifications, and these response strategies are likely to influence customers perceptions of and reactions to the focal recall. I test this model using a sample of product recalls overseen by the Food and Drug Administration and the ensuing press releases made by recalling firms and find that recalling firms can both limit or exacerbate the potential negative backlash of customers depending on how they craft their responses."
2017,"Unsettling Settling-Up? Corporate Fraud and Heterogeneity in the Reputational Penalties to Directors This study addresses when and how the market for corporate directors acts as an ex post settling-up mechanism by penalizing individual directors who have overseen firms engaged in corporate wrongdoing. We advance an inter-disciplinary framework that builds upon organizational, legal, and social psychological research to highlight how regulatory proceedings, media coverage, board diversity, and the minority status of directors individually and collectively shape the ex post settling-up process. Using an extensive dataset consisting of 1821 directors associated with 197 cases for financial misrepresentation, we find significant evidence for heterogeneity in directors susceptibility to reputational penalties. We conclude by discussing the implications of our perspective and findings for future research on the social construction of culpability and the behavioral dynamics of reward and punishment in the labor market for directors."
2017,"Recovering Trees from Bad Orchards: Rehabilitation of Corrupt Organizations Previous research on firm rehabilitation after wrongdoing views it as a stakeholder-driven process motivated by the search to regain legitimacy. The rehabilitation process implies several stages that encompass apologies and the introduction of norms, as well as practices and controls that prevent further acts of wrongdoing. Much less investigated is firms rehabilitation in contexts where wrongdoing, i.e., corruption, is institutionalized. We fill this gap by studying the rehabilitation process of a mafia-managed firm in Sicily which, after being confiscated by the State, is managed by its former employees who decide to form a cooperative and endorse a social vocation. In so doing, we contribute to the literature on firms rehabilitation and show that different processes and stakeholders are involved in contexts where wrongdoing is socially accepted. "
2017,"A General Theory of Corporate Scandals Organizational scholars have usually followed an objectivist approach to study scandals, which equalize corporate scandals to the act of wrongdoing itself. In the last years, political scientists and sociologists have developed a constructivist approach to scandals, which emphasize the social construction nature of such events. This approach though has been mostly related to political scandals. We use these theories from political science and sociological literature to propose that corporate scandals should represent a distinctive area of research within the organizational wrongdoing literature and to build a general theory of corporate scandals based on the constructivist approach."
2017,Fortification as a Disruptive Technology and Diverse Incumbent Positionality in the U.S. Human Milk Ecosystem This article investigates the strategies that disrupters undertake when incumbents in an industry ecosystem offer diverse responses to disruptive technology. I investigate the strategies undertaken by a life sciences firm that introduced new fortification technologies to the human milk ecosystem in the United States. Insights based on collected data suggest strategies by which disruptors may secure incumbent sponsorship. These insights make contributions to the study of disruptive innovation and industry ecosystems.
2017,"Fields in Flux: Institutional Struggles over a Disruptive Technology in Book Publishing. I report on a case study of the electronic book in the field of trade book publishing in the United Kingdom between 2000 and 2016. A combination of interviews and archival data allowed me to reveal how actors in a field respond to the introduction of a disruptive technology  understood as a technology that has the potential to alter consolidated settlements in the distribution, appropriation and use of resources within a field  by taking advantage of the opportunity offered by the situation to extend their discretion and control over resources. My findings advance understanding of how actors respond to the entrance of a disruptive technology in an institutional field by regulating its affordances. In addition, my findings extend current literature on models of institutional change by portraying the field-level responses not as a linear institutional change process, but as a dialectical one, driven by the search of a new equilibrium among the interests of the various actors."
2017,"Fighting Factory Fiction: How Marginal Actors Resist the Dominant in UK Book Publishing This study gives insights into how marginal actors are able to resist a logic that has started to characterise a field. Based on the case of how small independent book publishers in the UK fight the increasing commercialisation of trade publishing that has led to the emergence of factory fiction, we identify three groups of resistant actors: preservers, who maintain an alternative minority logic, innovators, who purify a minority logic, and reformers, who radicalise a minority logic. We find that non-powerful, marginal actors can radically detach themselves from a dominant logic through causing internal logic shifts in a way that allows them to build a distinct niche for themselves. Our multi-level process model of institutional resistance suggests that resistance is a creative, rather than destructive, process that can lead to the emergence of new alternative norms, which give meaning to actors located at the periphery of a field. We contribute by addressing the issue of power asymmetries within institutional fields, giving insights into how marginal actors can emancipate themselves from dominant logics. Furthermore, our concepts of logic purification and radicalisation challenge the common conceptualisations of a dilution or weakening of minority logics once another logic has started to become dominant."
2017,"Exploring the Interplay of Mindset and Abilities at Multiple Organizational Interfaces This article explores organizational change driven by the digitalization of services in technology firms. The change offers exciting opportunities for improved value creation, but challenges the prevailing business models, and requires fundamental changes in resource and capability portfolios as well as their integration within business ecosystems. The study investigates the change at the institutional and capability realms at internal and external interfaces. This study is conducted as a multi-case study among seven globally operating firms. We observe their transition toward digitally enabled smart services and value-based business logic. Our findings identify three groups of barriers to change, causing internal and external mismatches of mindset and abilities. The study contributes to the organizational change literature by deriving an analytical framework for understanding the interconnected change of the mindset and abilities, as well as the alignment of those two. We suggest that to capitalize on the emerging opportunities related to the digitalization of services, firms may need to disrupt the status quo, and to reconstruct a more competitive internal and external configuration of abilities for service-based business models."
2017,"How Is the Role Identity of Outside Directors Shaped? We investigate how outside directors perceive their director role. Using the semi-structured interview approach with 60 outside directors with various backgrounds, we are able to identify some important patterns of the perceptions of their director role and how such perceptions are shaped. Our findings are consistent with resource dependence theory in that outside directors role identity is influenced by their human capital. We also found that what CEOs expect of the role and contribution of individual outside directors influences the role identity of directors supporting the behavioral perspective of corporate governance. We conjecture that agency logic does not always drive how outside directors perceive their role in an institutional context where such logic is not deeply embedded."
2017,"R&D; Spending, Financial Analyst, and Corporate Governance: The Inverted S-Curve Hypothesis  This study examines the nonlinear relationship between financial analyst coverage and corporate R&D; spending. The theoretical framework incorporates both the benefits and costs of being covered by financial analysts throughout different phases of coverage. Based on a sample of U.S. firms over 17 years, the empirical analysis supports the hypothesized inverted S-shaped relationship. Moreover, additional analysis suggests that this relationship is attenuated when a firms corporate governance structure is weak. The results highlight the dynamics of financial analysts role in corporate decision making."
2017,"Clear Blue Water: The Influence of Board Diversity, Rationality, and Politics on Firm Innovativeness This paper extends the literature on board diversity by explicitly studying the mechanisms by which board diversity affects firm innovativeness. We introduce a new type of board diversity  stakeholder diversity  which reflects the extent to which different stakeholders are represented on the board. Due to differences in interests of stakeholders, we propose that stakeholder diversity decreases and increases the extent of rationality and politics in the decision-making process respectively. Subsequently, we argue that rationality and politics can elicit and repulse innovation input from middle managers respectively, thus affecting firm innovativeness. We test these hypotheses at the total population of Dutch water authorities by analyzing the minutes of board of director meetings. We indeed find that stakeholder diversity has a negative effect on rationality and a positive effect on politics. Moreover, more rational decision-making increases the innovativeness of the organization, and the more political the decision-making is at an organization, the less innovative that organization is. We conclude by discussing the implications for the literature on board diversity, strategic decision-making, and innovativeness."
2017,"Red Ties and Blue Ties: Director Political Ideology and the Diffusion of Lone-Insider Boards Scholars have long recognized that interlocking directors, or directors who form social ties among companies by serving on multiple boards, act as conduits in the diffusion of corporate governance practices across the business landscape. Yet little attention has been paid to how directors differ in their individual motivation to transfer practices from one firm to another. Our study explores this issue in the context of the spread of the lone-insider (or CEO-only) board structure across the S&P; 500 from 1997 to 2012. We specifically examine how interlocking directors political ideologies, as reflected on the liberalism-conservatism spectrum, influence the interorganizational spread of lone-insider board structures. Integrating research on corporate governance, interorganizational diffusion, and political psychology, we argue and find evidence that conservative interlocking directors are more likely to transmit the practice across firms owing to their more favorable ideological predispositions toward lone-insider structures. We further demonstrate that this contagion process is shaped by sociocultural and organizational factors that can strengthen or weaken interlocking directors latitude in prompting adoption of the practice. In showing that directors are not uniformly motivated to transfer practices across firms, we highlight how the ideological beliefs of practice carriers can influence the diffusion process."
2017,"Solving Social Problems Through Social Entrepreneurship: Promise or Just Promises? Market mechanisms are increasingly being used to address social problems which were formerly the domain of public and civil society initiatives. Among them, social entrepreneurship  broadly understood as the use of revenue-generating practices to address social needs  has garnered particular enthusiasm. Yet, despite impressive growth in public and scholarly attention to social entrepreneurship (SE), we know surprisingly little about where, why, and how it succeeds or fails. What accounts for disparities between the ideal and the reality of policies that promote entrepreneurial solutions to social problems? Based on 70 semi-structured interviews with organizations representing two distinct visions of SE (focused on the entrepreneurs background or on the organizational form), as well as with organizations providing support to social entrepreneurs/enterprises, I argue that two primary myths account for this gap. The definitional myth promotes the idea that (1) (social) entrepreneurship is fundamentally about starting  rather than developing  enterprises, and (2) that social enterprises simultaneously pursue economic and social objectives, even at the start-up phase. The functional myth assumes that (1) the impact of social enterprises is at the level of communities or society, and (2) that impact is due to the particular social mission of the organization (its ends) rather than through the very act of entrepreneuring (its means). The paper contributes to the literature on market solutions to social problems, hybridity in social entrepreneurship and the evaluation of social impact."
2017,"Power and Reflexivity in Boundary Work: Addressing Inequality through Distributed Social Ownership We extend research in institutional theory that has highlighted the importance of boundaries and boundary work to create institutional impact, but has not foregrounded the power aspects inherent in such boundaries. Specifically, we address this gap by drawing on a qualitative ethnography of community radio in India to illuminate the work of creating and disrupting what we term power boundaries by outsider organizations (NGOs) working in communities. Our findings reveal that the outsider organization faces a tension between providing ownership of institutional structures to the community and simultaneously reducing societal inequality in the community. We explicate the role of power and reflexivity in resolving this tension through distributed social ownership, wherein the organization co-creates new boundaries that provide social ownership of institutional structures to community members, but does this in an equitably distributed way that disrupts pre-existing power boundaries in the community. We therefore show how a consideration of power and reflexivity informs institutional analyses, and specifically how these aspects help reveal the boundary work required by organizations to address societal inequality."
2017,"At the Frontline of Micro-Finance: Cultural Toolkits and Relational Agency an African Microfinance Institutions Frontline employees are the critical link translating microfinance institutions (MFIs)s missions to alleviate poverty into everyday work with poor clients. Existing research views frontline employees' work from an individualistic perspective. Informed by Western mainstream management models and theories of efficient organizing (e.g., goal setting and agency theory), frontline employees are held individually accountable and are expected to rely on their own discretion to carry out their work. Drawing on in-depth research of four MFIs and their frontline employees in Ghana, our paper provides new insights into microfinance frontline employees everyday work. Specifically, our findings provide unique insights how an individualistic view of frontline work poses critical challenges including to the very safety of the frontline workers and the microfinances mission of poverty alleviation when applied to deeply socially embedded and collective cultural settings. To deal with the significant challenges of their everyday work, frontline employees leverage an extensive cultural toolkit of relational practices. This practice-based account complements and enriches work on hybrid organizations as social change agents, specifically drawing attention to the often overlooked role of these frontline employees and how these employees enact relational agency in their daily work."
2017,"Platforms for the People? Public Entrepreneurship in Interstitial Fields In this paper we examine the concept of public entrepreneurship in the context of the newly emerged phenomenon of civic crowdfunding. Public entrepreneurship, despite important research in economics, political science and public administration, is relatively neglected in management and organizational studies; this gap becomes particularly acute when trying to examine implications for public entrepreneurship and the role of the State in new platforms for social innovation such as civic crowdfunding. Through these platforms, stakeholders from fields of community, private market and government interact in novel online configurations to identify, select, fund and implement solutions to social problems. To aid our understanding of public entrepreneurship from a management perspective and in such settings where fields intersect, we use the lens of organizational institutional theory and an emerging line of inquiry on the dynamics of interstitial fields. From our analysis of leading UK civic crowdfunding platform Spacehive, we extend theorizing on interstitial spaces and public entrepreneurship in three ways: (1) counter to existing arguments on the temporality of these spaces, we show how they may become durable yet with fluid participation; (2) the elaboration of institutional infrastructure in achieving this durability, and (3) the translational effects into the fields of origin from participating in such spaces. Such findings on the increased structuring of this interstitial space provide an improved understanding of the consequences for public entrepreneurship and the potential inequality that arises from these novel arrangements and rules for funding solutions to social problems."
2017,"The Who, What and How of Social Innovation. A Qualitative Comparative Analysis This article explores the emergent concept of social innovation empirically. It develops hypotheses on the factors that determine organisations social innovativeness, located at the levels of organisational behaviour, resources, and structure. To test these it draws on the qualitative in-depth study of seven social innovation streams (SI streams), that is broadly recognised social transformations. Each stream is located within a specific field of activity, ranging from arts to environmental sustainability, and studied across a sub-set of three to four countries out of a group of nine European countries. The case-based tracing of the SI streams yields insights on both, the evolvement of the innovations as well as the traits and relative contributions of involved firms, public agencies and non-profit organisations. The qualitative insights are converted into quantitative data and then analysed in a Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) that determines necessary and sufficient conditions for social innovation. The results suggest the favourable combinations of factors are very context dependent and that aggregation is hardly possible across fields. However, a set of organisation traits emerge that seem almost indispensable: most prominent among them social needs orientation, external organisational openness and local embeddedness."
2017,"A Mixture or a Compound? Community-Level Antecedents of Firms Category-Spanning Strategies This paper examines community-level antecedents of firms market diversification and product differentiation strategies using the concept of category spanning. Exploiting novel and extensive data on the restaurant industry in a large metropolitan statistical area, I find a contrasting effect of economic and social status of consumer communities on firms market diversification. Results show a negative effect of residents income levels and a positive effect of their education levels on the business scope of the restaurants in a focal town, both effects notable by statistical significance and size. Also, results from a computational text analysis of every word used in the menus of the sample restaurants suggest that it is educated social elites, culturally omnivorous and seeking novelty, who encourage firms to engage in product hybridization. Examining the full spectrum of the demand side with a novel theory and operationalization of spanning, this study complements the traditional focus in strategy research on the internal determinants of boundary spanning and contributes to understanding sociological and contextual factors influencing the development of firms sustainable competitive advantages. The study also has important theoretical and practical implications for questions ranging from the nuanced effects of the demand side characteristics of local communities on firm strategy to the enduring existence of different types of boundary spanners under the dominance of the categorical imperative logic."
2017,"Which Level of Identity Matters to Film Success: The Moderating Effect of Producer-level Identity This study shows that not all genre-spanned, thus atypical, films are equally devalued by critics. By tackling the issue of multilevel identities, including both product and producer level identity, we find that in the U.S film industry from 1991 to 2006, although an atypical film is more likely to get poorer evaluations from critics, if critics can refer to its director's identity of making atypical films, the relationship between the atypicality of her focal film and its critical ratings can be positively moderated. In order words, we show that atypical films by those directors who have known for their identity as genre spanners is more likely to get better critical evaluations than those films with the exactly same genre-based identity but a less helpful director-level identity in terms of establishing an expectation of subsequent atypical films as well as signaling the capability of making atypical films. In doing so, this study contributes to the literature on devaluations which category spanners are supposed to suffer and that on the issue of multilevel identities."
2017,"Claiming the Name Space: Name Imitation and Evaluation of Entrepreneurial Firms on the iOS Platform While competitive dynamics with respect to tangible resources and actions in the entrepreneurial setting have been relatively well- explored, competitive dynamics regarding audiences' cognitive space have received little attention. Among symbolic actions that entrepreneurial organizations can take to influence audience cognition, name imitation of successful organizations or products has the effect of shaping audiences perception that the imitating organizations or products belong to the same category as the successful ones. Such cognitive association, in turn, influences audience expectation and evaluation of the imitators. Our study uses the data from the iOS app platform and finds that name imitators that are not the original sellers experience negative audience evaluation because the imitators do not meet the audience expectation. The study advances how organizations can influence categorical association and audience expectation through symbolic management and how the initial successful player can reap the benefits by claiming the name space in the competitive landscape."
2017,"Identity Categories and Status Order Organizational identity categories emerge as organizations position their identities vis--vis other organizations in their field. Building on ecological research on identities, we argue that organizations derive status from the identity category that they belong and that spanning identity categories is detrimental for the social standing of organizations. We further theorize about how categorical status interacts with organizational status at founding. Organizations that have a historical legacy of high status are subsequently less influenced by the status of their identity category and suffer less from the negative effects of spanning identity categories. We test these arguments with longitudinal data on universities in Turkey. Our findings demonstrate that organizational identity categories are a significant source of status for organizations but that categorical sources of status are of secondary importance for organizations that are born with high status."
2017,"Preemption in the Face of Shifting Dilemmas: Comparing Accountability Policies at Adams  A large body of research has made great strides in identifying the numerous factors that may contribute to unintended consequences of policy implementation. Whereas these studies provide great insight into policy implementation and the importance of local context, they typically define the cutoff point for policy implementation as beginning on the first day of implementation. I take the logically prior step and examine what a high-stress school, Adams School , did in anticipation of policy change. I call this period the pre- implementation phase. During this time, schools are aware of an upcoming policy shift, prior to the policy being formally implemented. As they are operating in this period of time, schools might engage in reactive behavior oriented to their current metrics while engaging in anticipatory behavior, or preemptive reactivity, oriented to upcoming policy requirements. I compare two eras of accountability policy  NCLB and the Common Core Standards  to unpack the ways reactivity and organizational context combine to shape behavior under accountability pressure. I draw on complementary insights that outline the role of sensemaking and forward-looking orientation in shaping preemptive reactivity during the pre-implementation phase. I argue that being caught between reactive and preemptive reactive behavior creates particular forms of dilemmas for those being measured. These dilemmas play an important role in what organizations can and will do when seeking to meet two distinct sets of metrics."
2017,Change Leaders Framing Dynamics and the Popular Management Concept Implementation Trajectory We investigate how the implementation of a popular management concept and the associated organizational change is framed and reframed by change leaders in the course of the implementation trajectory. We reveal how the conceptual ambiguity of management concepts benefits careful reframing over time. We also show how reframing is triggered and influenced by opposing forces from within and outside of the organization. Overall we argue that collaborative acts of framing and reframing are essential to develop a better theoretical understanding of the management concept implementation trajectory and the persistence of management concepts in the organization.
2017,"Managing Organizational Momentum for Change: Connecting Chinese and Western Perspectives Due to its plural and implicit meanings, the concept of organizational momentum has proven difficult for researchers to advance. Inspired by the Chinese cultural philosophy and thinking, we elaborate a teleological approach of organizational momentum management, with four distinct aspects to improve configuration or complexity approach in organizational literatures. Our overall contribution is a conceptual model to illustrate the three-level strategies for the change agents to seize, entrain and create momentum, and to demonstrate the dynamics underlying the interplay of human actions and momentum in organizational change context. This model can contribute theoretical knowledge to the organizational momentum literature and configuration studies."
2017,"Cultural Foundations of Corporate Control: An Empirical Enquiry This paper argues for the importance of culture for corporate governance practices. We utilise both the contemporary and early patterns in settlement of Scots-Irish in the United States to study the effect of honour culture on the defensive behaviour of target firms in corporate control contests. Honour culture is characterised by reputation maintenance and defence. We compare the behaviour of target firms in places with varying degree of honour culture. We empirically test if firms located in places with an honour culture are more resistant to hostile takeovers when becoming a target. We find that these firms show more resistance to hostile takeovers when becoming a target, and are more likely to win the contests. Beyond the existing explanations for target firm resistance, this study sheds light on how cultural dynamics can shape takeover resistance and corporate control."
2017,"Institutional Pressures, Managerial Interests, and the Fate of Governance Practices in Japan In response to the increasing institutional pressures toward shareholder value management, firms have adopted shareholder- oriented management practices. However, the fate of the practices (i.e., whether the practices are retained over time or eventually abandoned) remains relatively unexplored. Thus, this study argues that the fate of shareholder-oriented management practices is determined by negotiating the tension between institutional pressures and managerial interests. This argument is tested by using the context of annual shareholder meetings by Japanese firms between 2001 and 2014. The findings demonstrate that managers who face poor firm performance and harsh criticism from shareholders tend to have conflicts with institutional pressures, thus abandoning the practices that manifest such pressures. In addition, this relationship is moderated by the level of managerial discretion in the decision-making process. This study contributes to the diffusion of shareholder- oriented management practices and institutional theory by examining the fate of these practicesa relatively unexplored areaand by incorporating the tension between institutional pressures and managerial interests into research on organizational responses to such pressures."
2017,"The Role of Radical Institutional Change on the Diffusion of New Governance Forms The study analyzes how the predominant and taken-for-granted type of governance structure within the organizational field of German foundations erodes due to the diffusion of a more corporate-like governance practice between 1870 and 2013. Moreover, we study how the period of 51 years of socialism in the former GDRin which the government nearly exterminated the organizational form of foundationsaffect the diffusion of this practice in the aftermath of the reunification. Results on the analysis of 9,780 German foundations confirm that governance structures that are common in the corporate world have diffused throughout the foundation sector over time with much higher rates for East German foundations after the reunification of Germany in 1990. This later finding is particular interesting as foundations established after 1990 in East Germany could easily adopt the successful West German governance model. Instead, however, they act like modern organizations influenced by forms well established in wider organizational circles rather than the distinctive and more corporatist forms predominant in Western Germany. We discuss this finding in the context of institutional legacy and the diffusion of practices in organizational fields, arguing that radical institutional change may be a key factor that leads to isomorphism across and not within organizational fields."
2017,"Institutional Resistance: All-Male Boards in the 21st Century According to institutional theory, isomorphism enables firms to acquire a license-to-operate and vital organizational resources. Yet, organizational fields often include small numbers of organizations that resist prevalent institutionalized norms. We study what sets institutional resistors apart from their conforming peers. We hypothesize that organizations with features which shield them from institutional pressures (reduced susceptibility) or compel them to ignore specific norms (reduced receptivity) are most likely to follow a strategy of institutional resistance. Empirically, we focus on major publicly traded corporations resisting mounting pressures to include women on boards. We find support for our hypotheses in a panel of S&P500; firms from 2003-2012. Specifically, all-male boards are more likely in firms which are comparatively less visible than their peers or primarily engage in business-to-business sales, reducing their susceptibility to institutional pressures. Moreover, all-male boards are more likely in firms with more inside directors, older directors, as well as those head-quartered in more conservative communities, reducing their receptivity for the institutional norm in question. We discuss implications for institutional theory and research on corporate social responsibility."
2017,"How Do Patent- and Alliance-Based Learning Influence Coopetition Pursuits? Firms cooperate with their competitors to create and capture syncretic rents when coopetition provides learning opportunities; however, coopetition can potentially provoke a learning race between competing firms that destroy firm competencies. Firm learning motivates critical strategic pursuits of technology-driven firms, including coopetition, of which salient tradeoffs hinge on a firms ability to learn with and learn from competitors. Technology-driven firms develop different learning efficacies from accumulating experiences in various learning modes. The theoretical connections between learning modes, learning efficacies, and coopetition pursuits of the firms remain vague in the extant literature. In this study, we seek answer to the research question: How is coopetition pursuit influenced by firm learning efficacies developed from past experiences in different learning modes? Specifically, we develop a conceptual framework that make salient the theoretical relations between technology-driven firm learning modes, namely, patent- and alliance-based learning, and firm learning efficacies, namely, absorptive capacities in external knowledge assimilation and internal knowledge recombination, alliance capabilities in joint exploration and joint exploitation. We argue a set of hypotheses on the influences of learning efficacies on subsequent coopetition pursuits of firms. We test our hypotheses using a longitudinal, multi-industry panel data set of U.S. technology-driven public firms from 1990  2008."
2017,"Coordinating Routine Transfer Across Firms: The Critical Role of Operative Transferring Agents As firms with different backgrounds increasingly join forces to transfer routines from the context of one firm to the other, there is a need to understand how such efforts can be jointly coordinated over time. Attending to the lack of theory of the drivers of cross-corporate routine transfer, the present paper offers an empirically based account of the key dynamics at play. The paper finds that even though firms share a goal of engaging in joint transfer and transformation, they may approach transferring work differently and emphasize embedding routines in technology, embodying routines in knowledge or enacting routines in practice to different degrees. The paper demonstrates the critical role of transferring agents understandings and actions for resolving such differences over time. The paper contributes to routines theory by illuminating how routines are embedded in a firms history as well as how uses of the history of another firm can be helpful during routine transfer. Additionally, the paper informs current discussions concerned with the micro-foundations of inter-firm collaboration and competition."
2017,"The Costs of Managing Strategic Alliances: Cost Drivers and Performance Effects  To determine whether strategic alliances are successful, prior research has focused on studying alliance performance. Previous studies indicate that alliance portfolio diversity and alliance portfolio size can reduce alliance performance considerably. However, the reasons for the performance decline are largely unexplored. Thus, the aim of this study is to examine the link between different alliance portfolio configurations (i.e., alliance portfolio diversity and alliance portfolio size) and related performance outcomes while explicitly considering three types of alliance costs (dyadic coordination, portfolio coordination and conflict resolution costs). Our SEM analysis of 151 biotechnology firms shows that the different alliance portfolio configurations varying in their respective influence on distinct alliance costs. Yet, not all alliance costs have the same diminishing effect on performance. Indeed, only conflict resolution costs decrease alliance performance significantly. Our research contributes not only to a better understanding of alliance costs but also their respective impact on alliance performance."
2017,"Unpacking Coopetition and Innovation: Contingency Roles of Pluralistic Network Embeddedness Extant research suggests the double-edged sword nature of coopetition in technology-driven industries. Specifically, coopetition may enhance value creation in firm technological innovation by providing complementary resources and learning opportunities. However, close interactions with competitors may spur competitive attacks, such as knowledge misappropriation, technological imitation, and learning races, leading to value destruction in firm innovation. The contextual conditions under which coopetition may enhance value creation or exacerbate value destruction remain unclear. In this study, we elucidate the contingency factors stemming from multiple network embeddedness of technology-driven firms, namely, centrality and structural hole spanning in a collaboration network and a knowledge network on the organizational level. We expound the direct effects of the structural characteristics of a firms network positions on its innovation economic value, and the moderation effects on the impacts of firm coopetition pursuits on innovation outcome. In so doing, we clarify the network-based conditions under which innovation-driven firms may augment value creation and mitigate value destruction as they pursue coopetition strategies, hence making a contribution to the current coopetition research. Additionally, our results contribute to the network pluralism literature by elucidating how doubly embedded firms achieve differential innovation outcomes under the structural influences from collaboration network and knowledge network."
2017,"Like Attracts Like? Revisiting Demographic Homophily in Entrepreneurship New high-tech ventures are an important source of job creation in the United States. However, access to job opportunities in high-tech entrepreneurship varies significantly across demographic groups. A well-established finding suggests that there is a strong tendency towards homogeneity both in the formation of entrepreneurial founding teams as well as the hiring of early employees. Prior work has emphasized the importance of founders influence over personnel selection processes in explaining the tendency towards homogeneity in start-ups workforces. However, disentangling the influence of personnel selection processes in producing workforce homogeneity from other possible mechanisms presents a significant challenge. Here, we propose that workforce homogeneity in start-ups may also result from workers tendency to self-sort into start-ups whose founders resemble them demographically. We use a unique dataset on the recruiting and hiring processes at a sample of high-tech start-ups to attribute between these different accounts. Our results suggest that the origins of demographic homogeneity between founders and the workers they hire lie in start-ups tendency to attract job candidates that resemble their founders, rather than their propensity to favor these candidates in personnel selection."
2017,"Community and Capital in Entrepreneurship and Economic Growth We argue that social integration - in the sense of within-community interconnectedness - and venture capital have a complementary relationship in fostering innovation, entrepreneurship, and economic growth. Using panel data on metropolitan areas in the United States, from 1993 to 2002, our analyses reveal that racial integration - in the microgeography of residential patterns - moderates the effect of venture capital, with more ethnically-integrated places benefiting more from the availability of venture capital. Our results remained robust to estimation with instrumental variables to address potential endogeneity in the supply of venture capital and in the level of social integration. We also provide evidence for the underlying mechanisms by demonstrating that communities with higher levels of racial integration foster the discovery of more novel and more valuable inventions and the emergence of more ethnically- diverse entrepreneurial groups."
2017,"Fools Enter Late? Founder Characteristics and the Inherently Weak Competitiveness of Late Entrants Does late entry cause weak competitiveness, or do inherently weak organizations enter later on average? Received literature has predominantly argued for the prior. The latter, however, is equally plausible, yet holds very different implications for theory and practice. I draw from well- established streams of literature to argue that entrepreneurs who lack relevant prior experience not only found weaker organizations on average, but also tend to enter an emerging industry relatively late. As a result, the higher-than-average failure rates among late entrants might be better explained by their inherently weak competitiveness rather than by their late time of entry and the unfavorable industry conditions at the time of their founding. The proposed theory is tested on a dataset of Greek stock brokerage companies, 1996-2005."
2017,"Potential of Newness: Spatial and Organizational Dynamics of Entrepreneurship This paper analyzes how entrepreneurs fare in intermediary market segments when the intermediary market segment is closely attached to a single supplier market. While focusing on two structural constraints, organizational and spatial factors, I build off of the fact that in the past thirty years in the U.S. beer industry, as the number of beer producers (i.e. brewers) proliferated, their intermediaries (i.e. wholesalers) declined. Using establishment-level restricted-access economic microdata from the Longitudinal Business Database and the Census of Wholesale Trade, I examine what happens with the intermediaries when (some) producers start competing on product variety instead of competing on scale. I find that Stinchcombes liability of newness principle can get suspended and certain newcomers have better survival chances than industry incumbents. That is, entrepreneurial establishments fare better if they are part of well-resourced multiunit firms and are entering the market in an area where a large proportion of establishments exited previously. The results highlight how organizational factors and geography create inequalities among intermediary organizations."
2017,"Learning from Others' Success and Failure: The Effect of Target Selection on Learning Outcomes The organizational learning scholars have asserted that organizations and individuals learn from others' success and failure. However, they have left unsolved questions on the effect of their target selection between successful and failed targets on learning outcomes. It begets the shortage of managerial implications. To expand our understanding of the role of target selection, we developed a computational model that features agents learning from either successful or failed targets. The results indicated that bitargeting in which organizations and individuals learn from both others' success and failure is the best strategy for adaptation for most cases. The strategy of bitargeting helps them to balance exploitation and exploration, and it is more effective than passive slow learning. The implications and the limitations are discussed."
2017,"Untangling the Behavioral and Relational Antecedents of Learning Traps in Inter-Organizational Ties Organizations are susceptible to two types of learning traps: success traps, in which they repeatedly hone a distinctive competence to the point that alternate paths become unattractive, and failure traps, in which they repeatedly explore new avenues, but never move down the learning curve on any given competency. Whether and how these dual learning traps apply to an organizations external relationships is a largely open question. In this manuscript, we draw on theories of performance feedback and inter-organizational embeddedness to develop an integrated theory of inter-organizational learning traps. We test the micro-foundational mechanisms in the context of Formula 1 motor racing, and demonstrate how the aggregation of these mechanisms leads to macro-level learning trap outcomes."
2017,"Smart Peers and Disruptive Social Comparisons: Evidence of Peer Effects from Quasi-experiment Is it beneficial to have more able peers? I suggest that the benefits of the peer depends not only on ability and knowledge of the peer, but also emotional and psychological constraints resulting from peer comparisons. Using data from a quasi-experimental setting where random assignment of peers occur, I test how peers with different ability levels influence the level of individuals academic achievement. My findings show that smart peers might be disruptive, more so when they outperform the individual by a high margin. The study emphasizes that cognitive as well as non-cognitive processes have to be considered in examining the benefits of peer relations. More broadly, the study contributes to the nuanced understanding of learning and how to maximally benefit from peers in the organizations."
2017,"In the Aftermath of Downsizing: Organizational Learning and the Interplay of (In)formal Networks Employee downsizing as a planned reduction of a firms staff size inevitably disrupts both formal (work) and informal (friendship) networks of a firm and thereby impacts organizational learning in several ways. However, there is only very limited knowledge on how organizational learning exactly evolves after such network disruptions occur. As a result, also quantitative examinations on the relevance of both networks in this context and their joint effects on the effectiveness of learning after downsizing are largely amiss. Therefore, we have developed a simulation model that builds on Marchs model (1991) and incorporates both formal and informal networks in order to examine how organizational learning responds to employee downsizing. Our analysis starts with a comparison of two common downsizing strategies, delayering and thinning out. These strategies differentially impact a firms formal network as delayering refers to the lay-off of all employees on one hierarchical level while thinning out, by contrast, removes the same number of employees across all hierarchical levels. Initially, we find that that thinning out leads to better performance than delayering. We then draw on Trevor and Nyberg (2008) and examine how higher levels of organizational turnover (post-downsizing) affect organizational learning. In fact, we find a non-linear relationship between post-downsizing turnover and performance, suggesting that moderate increases of turnover subsequent to downsizing can be beneficial for both downsizing strategies. Finally, we demonstrate the severity of the survivor syndrome and show that delayering might even outperform thinning out when firms respond to the survivor syndrome by implementing HR management practices for new employees (i.e., onboarding processes) that promote the creation of friendship relationships between employees."
2017,"Community Fusion and Fission: Network Dynamics Perspectives on Individual Creative Performance This study examines determinants of individual creativity from an unexplored perspective, the performance implications of network dynamics. I introduce two concepts: community fusion and fission. Community fusion is a type of network dynamics characterized by merging formerly distinctive communities into an integrated community over time. Community fission, on the other hand, is characterized by splitting one community into multiple parts. I argue that each mode has its own benefits for individual creativity. Community fusion is likely to involve transferring and integrating distinctive knowledge, while community fission allows an individual to exploit his/her extant knowledge in new opportunities outside the community. I test my hypotheses, which predicts differing effects of these two modes of dynamics on artistic and commercial performance, using data comprising 34,669 creatoryear units from the Japanese music industry over a 30-year period. My results show that the number of community fusions with an embedded creator has an inverted-U shaped effect on his/her creative performance, whereas the effect with the number of community fissions is U-shaped for commercial performance only. My study is the first attempt to examine the impact of directed network dynamics at the community level on individual creative performance."
2017,"Global Diffusion of Cultural Products: Intentional and Unintentional Diffusion of Korean Pop Music This study extends research on the diffusion of cultural products by examining when and how cultural products from a semi-peripheral market diffuse to not only culturally similar but also culturally dissimilar foreign markets. We specifically investigate an exemplary case of Korean pop music (K-pop) which, in the past 15 years, diffused not only within Asia but broadly to culturally dissimilar markets as well. We argue that producers can strategically enter foreign markets that are culturally similar but strategic entry into culturally dissimilar markets are largely ineffective. In terms of diffusion to culturally dissimilar foreign markets, we argue that cultural products that are low in cultural specificity and those that fill an unmet market demand will diffuse broadly. In our context of K-pop, we find that singers from the Big 3 entertainment agencies that strategically pursued foreign markets are more popular than other singers only in Asian markets. We also find that K-pop boy bands, a cultural product low in cultural specificity which fills a market niche among female teenagers, are the most popular type of K-pop singers especially in geo-culturally dissimilar foreign markets."
2017,"Embeddedness and the Production of Novelty in Music: A Multi-Dimensional Perspective Creativity and innovation are central to cultural production, but what makes certain producers more likely to innovate than others? We revisit the concept of embeddedness to evaluate how different dimensions of social structure affect the production of novelty in music. Using original data on over 10,000 unique artists and 115,000 songs recorded and released between 1960 and 1995, we estimate how musicians social, cultural, organizational, and geographic embeddedness affects their propensity to create novel products. Results from a series of Relational Event Models (REMs) suggest that artists who are highly culturally and geographically connected are more likely to create novel songs, especially when they span multiple genres, are women, or are in the early stages of their careers. Surprisingly, variations in social and organizational embeddedness do not significantly influence this outcome. These findings produce new insights into the production of novelty in music, and encourage us to further examine the multiplexity of embeddedness and its role in organizing innovation."
2017,"Burden for Business, Chance of Creators: The Divergent Effect of Intra-Portfolio Competition  Creators of products such as video games, movies, or musicals often collaborate with publishers for support in developing and marketing their products. Since publishers often represent similar products, the creators product may be exposed to intra-portfolio competition. Prior research suggests such intra-portfolio competition to negatively affect product success. Given that the creators careers are shaped by the success of their past product, one would expect intra-portfolio competition to negatively affect them as well. We do, however, suggest that intra- portfolio competition has a positive second-order effect. It facilitates the formation of relationships among creators working on competing products. Such relationships can benefit creators so that they work on more promising products in the future. We test our theory on this divergent effect of intra-portfolio competition on the success of the product and the creators using archival data of the video game industry. We contribute to research on the effects of intra-portfolio competition and examine potential agency conflicts."
2017,"The Good in Being Notoriously Bad: Repeated Acts of Corporate Illegality and Investor Reactions When news about a firms illegal behavior become public, investors face considerable difficulties in assessing the magnitude of its impact on the offenders financial performance. Facing this opaque information environment, investors are likely to look for alternative informational cues. Research on organizational reputation and cognition suggests that a firms criminal history (i.e., the number of its prior illegal acts) may convey important information to investors about whether the focal allegation is warranted and whether the alleged illegal act is likely to remain a one-off event. Based on an in-depth analysis of illegal acts in the U.S. utilities industry over a 28-year time horizon, we find support for the proposition that a firms criminal history influences investor reactions to newly detected illegal acts. Investors penalize firms with no or a minor criminal history less severely. Interestingly, however, we also find that investors react less negatively to new illegal acts involving firms with extensive criminal histories than to new acts involving firms with moderate criminal histories. We further find that the pervasiveness of corporate illegality in the industry and prior firm acquittals alter the effect of recidivism on investor reactions. Collectively, our study thus answers recent calls to explore the role of recidivism in the context of corporate illegality and provides some evidence for positive side effects of a bad corporate reputation."
2017,"Unintended Consequences of Impression Management: Corporate-Nonprofit Interlocks Lower Misconduct Non-profit organizations may be perceived as the antithesis of large corporations, but the corporate elite are known to be active participants in civic life. Corporations interact with their communities in various ways and social influence transcends sector boundaries. This paper explores the extent to which a corporations embeddedness in the nonprofit sector influences the occurrence of corporate misconduct. By leveraging a unique dataset of the board interlocks between Fortune 500 corporations and nonprofit organizations, this paper expands the boundaries of the network under consideration and examines the role of inter- organizational ties with non-market actors. The findings show that corporations board interlocks with nonprofit organizations decreases organizational misconduct, especially when these interlocks are formed with social-welfare oriented nonprofit organizations and large nonprofit boards. These results suggest that corporate- nonprofit interlocks serve a signaling mechanism and facilitate perceptions of values and monitoring which inhibit non-normative behaviors."
2017,"The Role of Allegations in the Labeling of Wrongdoers: Misconduct in the Chicago Police Department Research on misconduct has explored both what causes actors to commit certain behaviors as well as the consequences of those actions when they become public knowledge. However, less attention has been directed at the necessary intermediate step whereby social control agents label some actors but not others wrongdoers. As a result, empirical samples of wrongdoers may be indeterminately biased by the social environments from which they arise. In this paper I propose allegations as a distinct mechanism in the process by which actors are officially labeled wrongdoers, and highlight how discrepancies might arise between behaviors, the creation of allegations, and the assignment of wrongdoer labels based on those allegations. I apply this framework to recently released data detailing all 28,588 allegations of misconduct led from March 13, 2011 to August 19, 2015 against the Chicago Police Department, the countrys second largest law enforcement agency. I find that demographic traits of both officers and complainants do not equally predict the generation and validation of allegations. For example, black officers received allegations at a lower rate than white officers, but were more likely to have them sustained, and allegations made by black complainants were less likely to be sustained than those made by white complainants; a similar mismatch existed for gender. These results highlight how social factors may shape who ultimately gets labeled a wrongdoer in this and other settings."
2017,"The Contagion of Financial Misconduct within Interlock Networks: A Contingency of Status This study examines the contingency of focal-interlocked firms relative status difference to determine the contagion of financial misconduct within interlock networks. Basing on data from public listed firms in China, we separate our sample into two parts: 2576 firm-year observations for focal firms with higher status than interlocked misconduct firms and 3693 firm-year observations for focal firms with lower status than interlocked misconduct firms. Findings reveal that the focal firms are more likely to engage in financial misconduct if their interlocked firms, which has engaged in financial misconduct, have higher status than the focal firms. For focal firms with higher status than their interlocked misconduct firms, the status of focal firm will strengthen the negative relationship between the ratio of interlocked firms engage in financial misconduct and the likelihood that firm will also engage in financial misconduct. Moreover, connecting with low status firms, which do not engage in financial misconduct, will lower the likelihood of focal firm engaging in financial misconduct, suggesting that both bad and good behaviors are contagions across interlock networks with the contingency of status. We conclude with discussions on the implications for future research and practice."
2017,"Networks, Institutions, and Uncertainty: Information Exchange in Early-Modern Markets We analyze patterns of informal information exchange to assess the role of relational and institutional governance systems and uncertainty in encouraging information exchange, and therefore information flow. Using archival data from an emerging global trade network that developed over the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries, we show that uncertainty drove information exchange. Relational governance mechanisms such as small group exchange were largely absent, and increasing institutional strength was associated with decreasing rates of information exchange. The results suggest that opportunity and demand were more important determinants of information exchange than the emergence of formal and relational governance systems."
2017,"Historical Imprints and Contemporary FDI Distribution in Chinese Cities We examine how the early international business legacy left by the Treaty Port era (1842-1943) affects Chinese cities' capabilities to attract and channel contemporary foreign direct investment (FDI). We find that two early international business conditions, Treaty Ports policy and overseas Chinese community, established an enduring set of institutions that affect cities' subsequent capability to attract foreign investment resources. Furthermore, we examine how these early imprinting effects were altered in subsequent sensitive periods characterized by institutional disorder (the Cultural Revolution) and a return to a favorable investment environment (the Reform and Opening-up era). This paper contributes to imprinting research by showing how multiple sensitive periods can affect initial imprints and developing a model to illustrate imprinting dynamics including imprint persistence, deterioration and reactivation."
2017,"Institutional Sedimentation: Navigating Chinas Shifting Political Landscape This study aims to unpack the process of institutional sedimentation, whereby organizations come to be layered with successive imprints beyond the founding period. Drawing upon historical research and a longitudinal case study, we trace how a flagship state-owned enterprise in China navigated punctuated shifts in its environment  shifts which undermined entrenched beliefs about what constitutes appropriate organizational behavior and goals. We identify three strategies  cognitive conditioning, cautious adaptation, and bridging  that enable an organization to conform to changing institutional mandates, whilst maintaining coherence with organizational elements inherited from the past. By detailing the complex interplay between different generations of imprints, our study sheds light on the intraorganizational processes that determine why some elements and not others are imprinted upon an organization; and, why some imprints persist while others decay or fade away. In so doing, our study provides insights into how organizations manage persistent tensions between adaptive and inertial pressures."
2017,"Environment Effects in Organizational Form Emergence: The Origin of Two For-Profit Stock Exchanges This study sets out to advance our understanding on how organization environments induce highly embedded actors to take up new organizational forms. We conduct comparative historical study of two stock exchanges, Stockholm and Helsinki stock exchange, that became first and second in the world to take up the for-profit organizational model in 1993 and 1995 respectively. We use a large set of digitized archival data from the two settings to analyse organization environment incidents that developed in the two local settings and the organizational activities of the two stock exchanges. We found that external effects were moderated by local effects inducing organizational misfit to accumulate. Most interestingly we found that these environment-organization effects were exacerbated by peer interaction, joint exploratory work for a joint Nordic exchange, cross listings by firms, brokers starting operating at both stock exchanges, and regulatory harmonization work. This peer interaction induced analog competition and convergent guidelines for the new organizational form. Our contribution is to provide a nested model of environment effects on organization emergence and expose peer effects as previously unrecognized organization environment effects."
2017,"At the Interface between Personal Motives, Organizational Purpose and Societal Development The search for sustainable alignments between economic, environmental and social goals at the personal, organizational and societal level has been a key task of scholars from different disciplines. Yet, the dominant management theories assume a permanent trade-off of motives between these three levels and an instrumental rationality approach to study them. This work proposes a model for a sustainable alignment between personal interests, organizational purpose and societal development, replacing the dominant assumptions of self-interest and instrumental rationality for the concepts of self-love and practical rationality to resolve the current tensions at the interface between levels of analysis."
2017,"Swinging between Moral and Market Imperatives Financial institutions with religious affiliations are active participants in the financial market, engaging in various risky financial behaviors, yet existing studies of religion and risk preferences yield inconsistent findings. Informed by institutional theory, we argue that moral imperatives are foundational for religious organizations identity; as such, the nature of the risky financial behaviors in which religious financial institutions engage matters. By examining religious credit unions engagement in the risky financial product private- label mortgage-backed security (PMBS), we argue that religious credit unions shun financial products associated with deception, greed, and excessive value extractions that clash with the core moral principles of probity, justice, and trust that are fundamental to religious identity. Furthermore, we propose that as market participants, religious credit unions are subject to institutional demands from religion as well as the capitalist market. We identify two local community- level characteristics that moderate the relationship of religious organizational identity and engagement in PMBS: the density of religious organizations that enhances this relationship, and the prevalence of for-profit financial institutions that attenuates this relationship. We test and find empirical support for our theory using American credit union- and community-level data during the years 2010 to 2014. We conclude by discussing contributions to research on organizational identity, institutional theory, hybrid organizations, and financial institutions."
2017,"Faithful to the Values or the Value? The Relationship between Corporate Philanthropy and Violation Prior research suggests that the corporate social responsibility and irresponsibility actions of a firm may remain stable so long as its leaders, governance structures, and institutional environment do not change. In this research, based on moral identity and moral regulation views, we propose that although firms may be generally consistent in their moral-related decisions crossing time and situations, their actions also fluctuate because of the decision-makers psychological moral licensing and moral cleansing. Specifically, firms which make more donations in a certain year are likely to commit some wrongdoings in the next year, and firms which commit more wrongdoings in a certain year are likely to make some donations in the next year. We further argue that the ratio of independent director in board and their average salary may weaken the moral licensing effect and share concentration may weaken the moral cleansing effect. Empirical analyses using data on Chinese firms listed on stock exchanges from 2007 to 2014 support the moral licensing effect and the moderation of independent director ratio and their salary."
2017,"Enchanting Fields: Collective Events and Emotion as Value-Amplifiers for the Maker Movement Emerging economic fields often resemble social movements because the risk of championing new and unrecognizable business ventures deters opportunists solely interested in maximizing profit, leaving social movement organizations and socially and politically motivated field pioneers to fight for field formation. However, once social and material support for a new field is established, the draw of more certain profits pulls in entrepreneurs that are solely interested in establishing a money-making enterprise. These new entrants are more likely to prioritize economic efficiency over social and political goals associated with the early, movement-like field. As a field becomes more legitimate and profitable, the market pull dilutes the overall value-rationality of the market. Applying this theory of legitimation to the maker movement, an education and open-source technology movement that has fueled a nascent field, we find that dilutionthe increasing prevalence of profit-orientation relative to value-orientation among businesses in the field is not a foregone conclusion in an a field that is becoming more legitimate and profitable. Rather, organizations can use collective events to foster emotion, which in turn serves to maintain and affirm the fields value rationality even as the field becomes legitimized and more heterogeneous in terms of field participant motivation. This study identifies an emotion-based mechanism through which markets and organizations can sustain and recharge their values, providing conditions under which value rationality and instrumental rationality in a field remain compatible even as the field becomes legitimized."
2017,"Incentive or Teamwork? Impact of CEO and TMT Pay Structures on Geographic Diversification Research shows that CEO aggregate pay is associated with geographic diversification; however, it is unclear whether specific types of CEO pay have any impact on decisions to expand geographically. Focusing our research on stock options, we advance our understanding of this relationship by theorizing and showing that unexercisable options positively induce diversification because CEOs bet on long-term option horizons to pay off but that exercisable options impose a negative effect because CEOs seek to protect their endowed option values. Moreover, research devoted to the horizontal pay dispersion effect typically focuses on total pay values; therefore, we have little knowledge about how different types of dispersed option pay among top management team (TMT) members might exert moderating influences on geographic diversification. We suggest that as the values of CEO unexercisable and exercisable options increase, high TMT unexercisable option pay dispersion creates team conflicts and behavioral fragmentation leading to diversification reductions, whereas high TMT exercisable option pay dispersion engenders collaboration and cooperation resulting in diversification increases. Empirical testing largely supports our hypotheses."
2017,"Implications of Interlock Relationships on Executive Compensation: the Case of Germany There is already a consensus that social capital plays a crucial role in executive compensation. However, previous empirical results are mixed and limited to U.S. data. This paper illustrates the effect of board social capital of CEOs in German DAX30 firms on the level and the risk of compensation (pay mix), thereby contributing to the ongoing discussion on the relationship between social capital and compensation. The tests showed that board social capital of CEOs positively influences both the level and the risk of compensation. The results however also show that the extent to which social capital influences compensation is dependent on moderators  firm risk and ownership concentration. While high firm risk may result in a positive relation between external social capital and compensation uncertainty, concentrated ownership may lead to a smaller compensation package with less risk."
2017,"Dad Is in the News! Vulnerable Identities and the Outrage Constraint on CEO Pay Being the subject of press coverage is often a source of tremendous pride if journalists report ones achievements, but a cause of utter embarrassment if they publicize ones personal failures. Especially negative reports can have dramatic reverberations in the social environment of the exposed individual. We study such cases and the responses that they trigger in the context of negative press coverage of perceived CEO overcompensation. We introduce the concept of vulnerable identities defined as identities that are likely to become threatened by public criticism and argue that executives endowed with vulnerable identities should be more inclined to agree to pay cuts subsequent to negative press coverage in order to resolve the incoherence between the criticized and the expected behavior associated with these identities. Based on a large, hand- collected data set of comprehensive biographic data of U.S. CEOs matched to media reports on their pay, we tested and found evidence in favor of our theory on identities that cover extensive parts of an executives life, including work, the family, and civic engagement. Our paper formalizes, tests and demonstrates the limits of the well-known outrage constraint suggested in the managerial power literature."
2017,"How U.S. Corporations Changed Executive Compensation after Enron: Substance and Symbol This study analyzes how and why the fall of Enron in 2002 triggered substantive and symbolic changes to executive compensation among U.S. corporations. In particular, we examine the significant legitimacy challenges arising in the post-Enron decade regarding executive stock options, a signature practice normatively advanced by agency theory advocates. We develop a socio-political perspective that considers contestation at the societal, field, and firm levels to explain how and why the post-Enron criticism of stock options generated not only new regulations, but also more complex forms of compensation. We use our framework to predict how differences in intrafirm power (senior management vs. board) and external pressures (media vs. shareholders) drove variance in firm-specific responses to these field-wide changes, testing our predictions using a longitudinal dataset comprised of S&P; 500 firms and their senior executives. Our findings reveal that these responses involved both substantial and symbolic changes in compensation, with firms responding more symbolically when CEOs had more power over their boards. We discuss the implications of our approach and findings for future research on executive compensation, corporate governance, and institutional decoupling."
2017,"A Collective Action Process Model For Attitudes To Organizational Change Following decades of work on the nature and function of individual attitudes to change, attention has increasingly been paid to multilevel approaches to change in organizations. Yet the typical view remains that attitude to change spreads across individuals, creating clusters of shared attitudes. In this paper, we develop a more nuanced model of collective attitude to change by identifying the generative mechanisms of how collective attitudes to change form, as well as the circumstances and contingencies under which new collective attitudes emerge that do not necessarily reflect individually-held attitudes on change. In contrast to conventional assumptions on attitude formation, this approach considers the way that attitudes to change emerge as a new collective state. This state depicts a critical threshold when an individuals attitude becomes representative of the collective. We describe each of the phases of this process, distinguishing between different types of collective interactions to underscore how individual attitudes to change are in flux. Extending previous work on the multilevel character of attitudes toward change, we provide conceptual guidelines to explain different change reactions, highlighting the process conditions necessary for how group solidarity in attitudes to change are created. In this way, the paper adds to scholarship on change attitude formation and its measurement."
2017,"Perceived Temporal Discontinuity in Organizational Change Processes - Risks and Consequences The main contribution of this paper is to show the connection between perceived temporal (dis)continuity and commitment to organizational change. Applying a temporal perspective to organizational change, the paper shows how perceived temporal continuity is important for the ways in which organizational members commit to the change process. Based on my study, I label the excluded past and the disassociated future as a causes for perceived discontinuity. I argue that on one hand, the excluded past will reduce available cognitive resources to draw projections to the future and thus limit potentiality for commitment as an action; and on the other hand, if the envisioned future is disassociated from past and present it remains implausible to actors and hence, reduces their commitment to the course of change."
2017,"When is a CSA no Longer a CSA? Member Tenure and Sensemaking During Organizational Change Theories of sensemaking have grown from its roots in retrospective narrative construction through dialogue to include branches promoting its cognitive dimensions and prospective potential. While these variations have led to some disagreements over the core properties (assumptions) of sensemaking, a common thread runs through them; the sensemaking approach and its many variations have developed primarily out of research on active, persisting groups and organizations. This results in a set of theories that assume that interactions between organization members or relevant stakeholders  even if ineffective or minimal  are possible. But what of organizations that dissolve or change so drastically that dialogue between parties is greatly restricted or eliminated entirely? Existing theories of sensemaking predict that sensemaking at the individual/cognitive level would result in individual schema change, and that minimal interaction might result in simple, nominal accounts of events. Using the case of the State-Line Farms Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) organization, which experienced such a drastic change in structure, I demonstrate that long-term members greater knowledge of organizational history and depth of personal experience facilitates their construction of detailed, and at times convergent, narratives despite little to no interaction with other members."
2017,"How Organizations Respond to Government-Driven Practices: Status-Based Practice Adoption How do organizations of different status respond when a new organizational practice that potentially has an impact on the current status hierarchy is introduced by the institutional environment? In bridging the literature on status and agency in institutional theory, the current study suggests that organizations of different status adopt and implement practices differently depending on the level of practice ambiguity, since such ambiguity either facilitates or constrains organizational discretion over the use of the practice. This paper argues that middle-status organizations extensively implement a practice with low ambiguity that minimizes the discretion gap with their high-/low-status counterparts. In contrast, both high- and low-status organizations extensively implement a practice with high ambiguity that allows for more discretion over the use of the practice itself. By examining adoptions of two new admission practices in Korean universities, this paper contributes to the status literature by extending the concept of middle-status conformity and discusses the implications of these findings."
2017,"Local Institutions and Heterogeneity in Emerging Fields: The Case of Slow Money This paper considers the role of local context in shaping micro- level interactions among a fields actors, which ultimately affects heterogeneity in emerging fields. Analysis of the Slow Money movement, which supports the development of sustainable local food systems by connecting sustainable food entrepreneurs with local investors, offers insights into how the practices of field actors are shaped by the institutional context. I introduce the concepts of infrastructural endowment and community support as key dimensions of the institutional context underlying variation in field practices. Consistent with the inhabited institutions perspective, I show that each chapter of the non-profit organization Slow Money developed different interpretations of the movement principles, depending on the local strength of infrastructural endowment vis-- vis community support. These different interpretations led to variation in terms of financial practices employed to support the entrepreneurs. This demonstrates that the same rhetoric was received, interpreted, and adapted differently in each local context, which contributed to the development of homegrown meanings and practices."
2017,"Ex Uno Plures: How Top Management Enactments of Organization Concepts Explain Practice Variation Why organization concepts and associated management practices vary as they diffuse is of significant interest to researchers. Addressing calls for comparative case studies of practice variation across organizations, this study purposively identified twenty nursing homes. Each was a willing adopter of same organization concept - small-scale living - premised on three core characteristics. Interviews with top managers, observation and secondary data analysis illuminate the nature and extent of practice variation across the cases, contextual constraints faced by managers, and their agentic responses. Conceptually, findings emphasize that practice implementation is inherently heterogeneous and that variation is the norm rather than the exception. Theoretically, findings evidence how practice variation is influenced by the context into which concepts are introduced, mediated by managerial interpretations (full or partial buy-in) of the concept, as well as managers agentic responses (alleviate, accept, accede) to constraints. The conjoint influence of context and agency leads to the identification of four forms of management enactment. Managers variously fully bought into the concept and worked to alleviate (purist) or accept (pragmatic) contextual constraints. Others purposively and intentionally modified the core principles (principled), whilst a final group fully acceded to challenges (poor). Each form of enactment is differentially associated with practice variation."
2017,"Vary or Not, Its a Matter of Experience and Dependence How do organizations respond to an evolving institutional pressure that keeps imposing new demands? This study suggests that experience complying with an earlier institutional demand bestows organizations with both the legitimacy to buffer future demands and the knowledge on managing them, and such buffering and learning mechanisms respectively lead organizations to avoid implementing a later institutional demand in its original form and to embrace deploying the very demands innovative variants. Furthermore, organizational dependence on key institutional stakeholder constrains either mechanism, because it subjects organizations to the stakeholders heightened expectation and pressure and also embeds them in the latters value and assumptions. I test this framework using the context of Chinese private firms implementation of the Communist Party branch after their deployment of labor union, two practices consecutively demanded by the dominant institutional stakeholder  the Chinese government. Results suggest that private firms having more experience with labor union are more likely to deploy an innovative Party branch variant and less likely to implement the prototypical Party branch, and both effects are weakened for the firms heavily dependent on governmental resources. Contributions to organizational responses to institutional complexity and intra- organizational sources of practice variation are discussed."
2017,"Relational Pluralism and Practice Variation Research on inter-organizational networks has generally taken a monolithic approach to explanations deriving from network positions, ignoring the multiplicity of networks that the organization is embedded in, heterogeneity in institutional backdrop of network partners and possible costs of maintaining network ties. The purpose of this study is to explore the implications of the key idea that not only the organizations are embedded in multiple networks, but also these networks themselves are institutional contexts. Focusing on the variation in corporate philanthropic activities of all banks in Turkey for the period of 2008-2012, this study explores; (1) how inter-organizational networks influence organizational preferences, and (2) the strategies organizations use to deal with network multiplicity. This study uses a unique dataset of over 2,600 philanthropic projects. Multilevel models are used to test the hypothesis. The findings suggest that network membership homogenizes practices; organizational level filters moderate this influence, when faced with network multiplicity, organizations diversify their portfolios and in corporate philanthropy. This study contributes to recent attempts on how institutional and networks perspectives can complement each other to present an alternative view to more traditional, monolithic representation of workings of networks. This study also contributes to research on corporate philanthropy to show the antecedents of corporate philanthropic portfolios."
2017,"Integrating Effort in Emerging Pluralistic Organizations This study investigates how organizations that emerge in pluralistic settings can integrate effort to achieve a collective end. In this form of organizing, independent actors with discordant preferences share decision-making power over interdependent choices. Our insights are grounded in the planning of a new railway network in the UK, the High-Speed 2 project. Using an organization design lens, we encounter two mechanisms to integrate effort after a designated leader manipulates the structure of direct participation in decision-making. Resolving the coordination problem is up to technical working groups through voluntary information provision and processing. Their work uses rationalistic criteria to whittle the solution space down to a short list of options. As trade-offs emerge, organizational leaders must cooperate to build a negotiated consensus within the coordinated solution space. We reveal variance in the interplay between coordination and cooperation contingent on goal congruence and urgency to build consensus. We conclude by discussing logic linking pluralistic organizing structure to organizational performance."
2017,"Network Administrative Organizations Legitimizing Multi-Stakeholder Networks  Drawing on a multi-method case study of a development organization that worked for an inclusive dairy value chain in Ethiopia, this paper examines the role of Network Administrative Organizations (NAOs) in building multi-stakeholder networks to address social challenges in emerging markets. We highlight how NAOs promote the exchange of knowledge as well as the development of the governance capacity among network participants by organizing event-series. We further identify the boundary conditions for the success of these activities. Not only are internal and external network legitimacy relevant as existing literature suggests but we also found that the legitimacy of the NAO itself is critical for explaining the efficacy of multi-stakeholder networks. Overall, this article contributes to the literature on cross-sector collaborations by uncovering the evolution and outcomes of purposefully engineered multi-stakeholder networks by NAOs."
2017,"Interrelating Collaboration Practices and Identity Formation in Interorganizational Partnerships This work studies the process by which interorganizational partnerships develop collective identities, and, in particular, how collaboration practices and identity processes interplay as partnerships evolves through time. We conducted a longitudinal study in a partnership where organizations from different sectors collaborated to realize a science park. We followed the evolution of the partnership across four stages (setup, design, implementation, and redesign), highlighting for each phase how collective identity processes and collaboration practices interplayed. We document that the enthusiasm and urgency in the initial phases led partners to immediately create a strong sense of belongingness to the partnership, which we labelled as swift collective identity. While in the beginning the swift identity mobilized collaboration practices (i.e., precocious alignment), as the partnership evolved, it became dissonant with what partners could actually accomplish together (misalignment), and, after being dismantled and reelaborated, it set the basis for a more gradual, and slow paced identity (realignment). By discussing alternation between swift identities and small collaboration wins, we contribute to a better understanding of the identity-collaboration interplay in interorganizational settings. By connecting identity fluidity with reification and embeddedness, we also contribute to the current conversation on the construction of collective identities."
2017,"What do We Have in Common? The Development of Common Resources in a Meta-organization We study the development process of common resources in Helix Nebula. Helix Nebula is a meta-organization of highly heterogeneous collaborating actors, including scientific organizations like CERN, EMBL, and ESA, commercial cloud providers and public infrastructure organizations. The actors in Helix Nebula collaborate to establish a European open science cloud that can be used by scientific institutes to flexibly buy cloud computing resources from different commercial organizations. This requires the development of common resources to allow demand and supply actors to use the cloud computing infrastructure effectively. We study the process of development of common resources in Helix Nebula as an exemplary meta- organization. Our study illuminates that in the crystallizing process of common resources different development options emerge that trigger the surfacing of differences and dependencies surface. This leads to a reconfiguration of the development options, around which clusters of decision-making actors and clusters of legitimating actors shape emerging micro- alliances. Thus, our study explains the development of common resources in meta-organizations of highly heterogeneous actors without hierarchical means is an organizing process that includes a continuous reconfiguration crystallizing development options and respective micro-alliances of decision-making and legitimating actors."
2017,"Construing Novelty: Category Boundaries and Venture Capital Investment in Recombination Research in economics and sociology points to recombination as the source of novel social and economic developments. Most systematic studies of this thesis investigate whether recombination is associated with the creation of high-impact technologies. This study looks at novelty in markets, investigating the association between recombination and venture capital investment. Acknowledging that people use different categories in different contexts, the author argues that the evaluators categorical system is foundational to what is recognized and rewarded as recombination. Supporting this view, findings show that venture capitalists are more likely to invest in software entrepreneurs that engage in recombination across market categories, but standard measures of recombination across technological categories (based on patent classes) are not associated with investment. In addition, whether a person values recombination depends on his orientation toward disrupting the status quo. In line with this, it is high and low status VCs who are more likely to invest in firms that engage in recombination. In syndicates comprised of middle status investors only, the direction of the effect reverses. Findings suggest that the evaluator role is fundamental to the concept of recombination and the construal of novelty in a domain."
2017,"Order as Quality Mystique? How Category Order Affects Status Mobility in Venture Capital Industry Extant research in organizational and economic sociology posits that organizations derive status from their prior demonstrations of quality, as well as their affiliations with high-status alters. Yet there are also indications that organizations may acquire status by compiling across salient social categories. To discriminate between more or less successful category spanners, we suggest the order of accumulated categories matters, because it serves as an indicator of commitment when audience assessing quality. This paper theorizes the category order and test whether it influences the mobility of organization status. More concretely, we measure the concept of erraticism and test whether it affects the status mobility of firms in Chinese venture capital (VC) industry between 2006 and 2012. Results of the empirical analyses indicate that VC firms would enhance their status position by showing less erraticism and moving incrementally between similar categories other than highly erratic category histories, supporting the argument that category order acts as well a mystique for quality that explains the organization status dynamics. Furthermore, this relationship is stronger for earlier- stage, less experienced VC firms."
2017,"Performance Effects of Global vs. Local Status: Evidence from Cross-Border Venture Capital Organizational status, as a type of firm-specific advantage, is generally considered beneficial for firm performance. However, the effects of status, commonly operationalized based on network ties, have typically been studied only in a single social setting, or network. Therefore, an important gap in the intersection of economic sociology and international business is how should status be defined when a firm operates in multiple markets. In this paper, adopting the global versus local perspective of international business research in analysis of organizational status, we differentiate between status in global and local networks and compare their performance effects in foreign markets by constructing interfirm networks at both global and local levels. To further examine the performance effects of global and local status, we investigate the contingencies of these effects by focusing on the value chain position and high technology focus. We test our hypotheses using event history analysis of exit performance in cross-border VC investments between 1996 and 2016. Our results suggest that while global status does not have a direct performance effect, local status is generally beneficial for firm performance in foreign markets and is more salient at the upstream end of the value chain but less so in high-tech investments."
2017,"Institutional Logics of Funding Partners and New Venture Survival in an Emerging Market Context A new strand of research within the entrepreneurial approach to entrepreneurship shifts focus away from broad field-level institutional logics, and their effect on new venture performance, towards an analysis of the performance advantages of logics carried by organizational partners (Pahnke et al., 2015). Drawing on contingency theory, we build on this theoretical argument by demonstrating that the performance advantages of funding partner logics could vary across economic and social jolts in the new ventures environment. The economic jolt under consideration in this study is inflows of FDI, and the social jolt under consideration in this study is inflows of refugees. We analyze the likelihood of venture failure within the first two years of operation across family, bank, and government funded ventures. We use a sample of 9565 businesses from Jordan founded between 2003 and 2013. Our findings indicate that bank and government funded new ventures tend to perform better overall, but family funded new ventures tend to perform better during economic jolts, and bank funded new ventures tend to perform better during social jolts. The implications of our findings are discussed."
2017,"Toward Organizations as Creative and Living Structures: Ambidexterity through Design Organizational ambidexteritythe search for structures, processes and practices supporting the two seemingly mutually exclusive functions of exploitation and explorationhas been extensively researched in the management domain. However, while it is widely accepted that both exploration and exploitation are important for organizational success and sustainability, relatively few studies have explored the design of mechanisms that enable these functions, with little relevant overlap between the traditional design and management literatures. This study investigates how design might assist the development of structures to support ambidexterity. Our findings indicate that the ambidextrous organization requires three distinct functions: coherence creation, adaptability support and allowing for generativity. Each of these requirements must be appropriately designed to enable the organization to continuously renew itself."
2017,"Learning from Ambidexterity Experience To overcome conflicting findings in ambidexterity research, this paper expands the debate on experiential learning in the ambidexterity literature. We argue that experience in a specific ambidexterity mode (i.e. contextual or sequential) positively affects the relationship between a firms contextual or sequential ambidexterity and its invention productivity. Longitudinal data on German biotechnology firms alliance portfolio dynamics partially support our hypotheses. We find that sequential ambidexterity benefits invention productivity the more experience firms have in either sequential or contextual ambidexterity. Interestingly, neither experience in sequential nor contextual ambidexterity benefits the execution of contextual ambidexterity. This paper advances ambidexterity research by elucidating the important and complex, but so far overlooked, role of learning from experience for ambidexterity outcomes and by introducing methods to operationalize ambidexterity modes and the experience firms accumulated in their execution."
2017,"The Effects of Organizational Controls on Innovation Modes: An Ambidexterity Perspective Organizational controls are increasingly considered effective tools for firms to attain desired organizational goals while simultaneously being able to encourage innovativeness, especially in innovation- intensive firms. However, little theory exists on how exactly competing but interdependent control types create tension that affects innovation modes, and empirical studies remain rare. To addresses this question, this research links Hitts internal control system framework and the ambidexterity perspective by building on their focus on the interplay and tensions between different organizational control types. Using survey data from 182 Chinese firms in innovation- intensive manufacturing industries, the results provide evidence that besides the independent use of strategic control, both the combined and balanced use of strategic and financial controls are important for internal innovation. For firms specializing in cooperative innovation, however, financial control is more effective and the combined use of strategic and financial controls may discourage cooperative innovation. These findings contribute to our understanding of organizational control itself and its connection to the ambidexterity perspective and innovation theory. Also, the results suggest that looking beyond the application of a single control mode and as well as taking into consideration the balance of control types are quite important for firms facing a highly dynamic environment."
2017,"The Effect of Experience in Developing Innovation End-products for Commercial Use The diversity of experience is often cited as a key to innovations, while the amount of experience in innovations receives much less attention. Based on the analysis of early Facebook applications (apps) as an example of innovation projects, we argue that if the entire process from idea generation to implementation is taken into account, the amount of experience is important, and it interacts with the diversity of experience in a nuanced way to impact how the apps are accepted by the end users. In particular, we find the negative interactive effect between the amount and diversity of experience, such that incremental app experience confers less positive impact on the popularity of a Facebook app when the app developers have diverse experience compared to others having less diverse one. In addition, the amount of experience has a less positive impact for apps developed by groups of developers compared to solo developers, especially with diverse experience. These findings show complex trade-offs between accumulating focused and diverse experience in innovation projects."
2017,"The Show Must Go On: How Architecture Firms Keep Functioning Despite Frequent Project Failure High involvement, enthusiasm, and passion for excellence are required when architecture firms develop projects to be submitted for design competitions. Notwithstanding the emotions and the energy necessary to prepare these submissions, failure is extremely likely; on average, only one out of ten submissions wins. Project failure is a frustrating experience that usually evokes negative emotions, such as sadness, anger, and griefemotions strongly conflicting with enthusiasm and passion. These contradictory emotional states elicit an intriguing question: how do these organizations deal with the resulting dilemma of upholding the positive emotions needed for developing outstanding competition projects, while experiencing frustrations likely to undermine enthusiasm and passion? Elite architecture firms have proven to handle this dilemma, and therefore we set out to empirically explore their developed practices. We studied coping practices through embedded case studies at two successful elite architecture firms, which also frequently fail in design competitions. Focusing on contradictory emotions and collective efforts on the organizational level rather than individual dissonances, our findings complement and extend existing literature regarding the role of emotions in organizations as well as collective emotion regulation for maintaining organizations."
2017,"A Conversational Approach to the Study of Routines in Creative Projects across Firms Boundaries This paper explores the role of conversation in the interaction between firm and external actors during collaborative creative projects that present high levels of ambiguity. Through an interpretative approach, we examined the dialogical exchange at a design agency between designers and their clients. We argue that conversation facilitates the collaboration by means of two mechanisms: the recognition of the ostensive pattern that mitigates the ambiguity over the creative process and the development of emotional energy that mitigates the ambiguity over creative outcomes. Findings also suggest that emotional energy contributes to retain clients engagement during the process by fostering regular interaction. Our findings contribute to the literature on routine dynamics and creativity because it shows how conversation generates emotional mechanisms that enable recurrent collaboration in creative projects."
2017,"Negotiation and Lovesongs: Brokerage of Paradoxes in Creative Projects Creative work is often advanced through projects that harness a constellation of specialized experts, resource gatekeepers, and users from across organizational and occupational boundaries. Brokers play an essential role within project-based industries, lending legitimacy to new ideas, arbitrating claims to quality and viability, and allocating scarce resources and support. Recent research on brokerage of creative projects illuminates the dynamic and relational practice of brokers who leverage their role to guide not only the generation ideas, but also the synthesis of ideas into a viable whole. While research suggests that the creative industries are rife with paradoxes, we have little understanding of how these paradoxes feature in the brokerage of creative projects. Analyzing data from an ethnographic investigation of independent music producers in the Nashville country music industry, I illustrate how producers leverage their brokerage role to navigate paradoxes arising in their creative projects. I find that creative brokerage involves navigating a progression of paradoxes, and identify how producers utilize their brokerage role to respond to these paradoxes in practice. The paper contributes to the growing literature on the practice and process of brokerage, introducing a fifth level of creative brokeragemanaging paradoxes."
2017,"Knowledge Creation across Worldviews: How Metaphors Impact and Orient Group Creativity  Metaphor are a central concept in organization theory as they help to create knowledge. Yet, despite the importance of metaphors, little is known about how they are used in projects of knowledge creation across worldviews, whereby participants maintain their specialization and work separately. With a longitudinal study of a multidisciplinary scientific project aimed at repairing broken spinal cord tissues, we show how metaphors facilitate collective knowledge creation. We contribute to the theory of knowledge creation across worldviews by showing how different creative effects of metaphors have different consequences on the orientation and stability of the collective work, and by clarifying how an organization can control metaphoric creative effects by modifying its knowledge base. We contribute to the theory on cycles of knowledge creation by showing that metaphors extend knowledge both horizontally and vertically, and by specifying the relationships with the other elements of the cycle that make a metaphor creative."
2017,"The Effect of Reputation on the Stability-Change Interplay  The positive short-term effect of possessing a good corporate reputation, as a substantial organizational intangible asset, on the organization's outcomes have been researched extensively. Nevertheless, studies on the long-term behavioral effects of reputation on organizations are rather rare. To that end, we propose that reputation acts as an institutional logic that could regulate the behavior and decisions of organizations. We specifically concentrate on the stability-change interplay, as the dichotomous decision that is affected by the path-dependent nature of reputation. We conceptualize on how reputation could push organizations into a competitive-inertial state by over-emphasis on the stability inducing initiatives of the firm, while discouraging them from engaging in change initiatives. Furthermore, we investigate two sets of moderators. First, the general business environment may foster a degree of uncertainty that may influence the impact of reputation on stability-change decisions. We investigate dynamism and organizational life-cycle as contingency factors. Second, we postulated the way reputable firms are socially embedded may have mitigating or reinforcing effects on the main influence of reputation. To capture this, we describe the impact of institutional ownership and a firm's network of relations."
2017,"Attribute-based Reputation as an Internal and External Signal: Examining the U.S Automobile Industry We study how reputation, based on specific firm attributes and directed towards specific firm stakeholders, functions as an internal and external expectations-setting mechanism shaping managerial and stakeholder decisions. Applying the behavioral theory of the firm we assert that firm reputation is an essential, continuous and operative organizational goal that affects managers decision and stakeholders actions towards the firm. We test our assertions by examining 17,879 product recalls from 15 automobile manufacturers in the U.S automobile industry from 1966 to 2010. Consistent with BTF predictions, we find that reputation goals influence managerial decision-making such that firms with a higher reputation for quality are more likely to voluntarily initiate a product recall than their less reputable counterparts. Externally, we find that the likelihood of government sanctions is greater for higher reputation firms as defects increase in severity and scope."
2017,"Reputation and Stakeholders: How Stakeholder-specific Reputations Affect Controversial Actions This study enhances our understanding of organizational reputation by exploring how a firms reputation in the eyes of different stakeholders influences the likelihood of its taking a controversial action, such as downsizing. On the one hand, firms that have a positive reputation are likely to be motivated to self-govern because of fear of losing reputation and losing future gains. On the other hand, reputable firms are more confident in their social acceptance and less limited by social norms and, therefore, less motivated to self-govern. To resolve this contradiction, I employ a stakeholder- based perspective that views the role of reputation in preventing a controversial action as contingent on stakeholders perception of such an action. Specifically, I examine how positive reputations in the eyes of two important stakeholder groups  investors and the public  affect the likelihood that a firm engages in a controversial strategy (for this study, downsizing). Using a longitudinal dataset of the 100 largest U.S. firms from 2004 to 2013, I find evidence for relationships between stakeholder-specific reputations and downsizing and for how this relationship varies depending on firms financial performance. In general, I find that firms that have positive reputations among investors as well as firms that have positive reputations among the public were less likely to downsize than other firms. However, the effect of these two reputations on the relationship between negative financial performance and the likelihood of downsizing diverged: whereas there was no evidence that a firms reputation with respect to investors changed the association of financial performance and the chances of downsizing, I find some evidence that reputation with respect to the public moderated the relationship between financial performance and downsizing. That is, positive reputation with respect to the public mitigated the relationship between financial performance and downsizing, but negative reputation with respect to the public amplified the relationship between financial performance and downsizing. These findings suggest that reputations with respect to different stakeholders control firms engagement in a controversial action to different degrees, and these differences can be explained by particular stakeholders preferences in particular contexts."
2017,"Two Sides to Every Coin: The Benefits and Burdens of Organizational Reputation on Employees We consider the possibility that a positive organizational reputation brings both benefits and burdens to employees working for those organizations. Drawing from the Red Queen notion in competitive strategy and from behavioral theories of stress, we argue that organizational reputation increases stakeholders expectations for positive outcomes. These expectations can cause employees to identify more with the high reputation organization, but they may also pressure employees to devote more of their time to the job. In turn, increased identification and time commitment have contrasting effects on employees emotional exhaustion. As such, organizational reputation simultaneously serves as a benefit to reduce employee emotional exhaustion via identification, but also as a burden to increase employee emotional exhaustion via additional time commitment. We also consider how emotional exhaustion influences employee performance, and we examine the moderating influence of reputation reminders to consider how pressure from the organization may enhance the effects of reputation. Our arguments are largely confirmed in a longitudinal study of employees from a diverse range of organizations."
2017,"From Vision to Glory: How Institutional Entrepreneurs Change Institutions The purpose of this study is to present a process by which institutional entrepreneurs can either modify an existing institution or create a new institution altogether. I highlight additions to previous theory by distinguishing a difference between developing a vision and promoting a vision. I also propose that a key endorsement, by triggering a bandwagon effect, strengthens the relationship between promoting a vision and mobilizing people. A key endorsement, coupled with the bandwagon effect, increases both the likelihood that people will be mobilized, as well as the number of people mobilized to accept the vision that the institutional entrepreneur wants to portray to potential allies."
2017,"Brokerage to Foster Social and Institutional Change in Emerging Sectors In the last decade, there has been an increasing focus on the connections between networks and the emergence and change of institutions and fields. However, there is still a knowledge gap in terms of how specific brokerage activities and orientations can support the institutional strategy of an individual or organization. This paper addresses this gap by analyzing how activities associated to a tertius gaudens orientation can support the institutional strategy of an organization interested in shaping an emerging sector. Data was collected on four agencies brokering in the social entrepreneurship sector in England and contributing towards establishing the boundaries and definition of the latter, setting membership criteria and attributing roles and rules of interaction. A thematic analysis was performed on 62 interviews and over 2,000 published documents and online posts. Across the four organizations, it was possible to identify two different gaudens-oriented brokerage strategies: based respectively on soft-power and hard-power approaches. The former transforms the network into an amplifier of the views of the brokering agency. The latter directly enhances the legitimacy and power of the brokering agency inside the sector, thus increasing its opportunity to diffuse its own views. This paper contributes to the literature on brokerage by expanding the concept of tertius gaudens, by exploring different approaches to adopt this strategic orientation and by illustrating the connection between brokerage and the shaping of sector boundaries and diffusion of shared meanings, practices and roles."
2017,"Mediating Human Rights-based Change in an Authoritarian State Institutional change is a key topic in organization study, but we know surprisingly little about how such change unfolds in change-resistant authoritarian countries. We use a historical study of the efforts by an international non-governmental organization, the Ford Foundation, to mediate human rights-based change in China. Mediated change is the process through which a mediator uses subtle tactics to broker values and practices from one social world to another. We find that mediated change involves tactics that reduce local actors institutional embeddedness in authoritarianism (e.g., disembedding tactics), and tactics that enhance local actors embeddedness in rights-based values and practices (e.g., embedding tactics). Overall, the study not only demonstrates the importance of accounting for mediated institutional change processes, but also reveals new insights into under-theorized aspects of the paradox of embedded agency."
2017,"Sub-field formation and field level change This paper extends our understanding of the structure and evolution of organizational fields. Through a case study of the emergence of a corporate legal sub-field in Italy it develops the concept of the sub-field as a distinct space which exists within the regulatory structure provided by the parent field but which is characterized by its distinctive institutional infrastructure. We also outline the process of sub-field formation as a distinct path of field evolution through which sub-fields emerge from formerly coherent fields, and identify two mechanisms - relational reconfiguration and community building  through which this may occur"
2017,"When a Competing Logic Arises: How Environmental Investment Funds Make Firms Greener Competing logics lead to heterogeneities in organizational forms and practices within the field, and recent research shows that the presence of a competing institutional logic can also change organizations from a related field, but the conditions under which such a cross-field penetration of institutional logic happens is under-researched. Analyzing a panel dataset of 1372 firms from 21 countries between 2003-2013 and rich qualitative data from fieldwork and archives, I reveal that the prevalence of an environmental logic as opposed to the mainstream financial logic in a country increases the environmental performance of firms therein, but such influence is contingent upon power relationships at multiple levels of analysis: it is stronger to smaller firms and to firms with a smaller board. This influence is also moderated by field characteristics, such as the fragmentation of the field that upholds the old logic and the presence of social movement organization in favor of the environmental logic. This study contributes to research on institutional theory and corporate social responsibility."
2017,"Multiple Modes of Participation in Cooperatives: A Typology of Pluralistic Settlements This article proposes a theory of multiple modes of participation in pluralistic cooperative organizations and what that means for the survival and growth of cooperatives. We construct a typology of pluralistic settlements that helps us understand how members of cooperatives engage in different modes of participation. We illustrate this framework using examples drawn from the literature on agricultural cooperatives in the United States. These cooperatives are shaped by a variety of settlements that utilize different scripts for what can be exchanged, with actors in which roles and how and thus exhibit very different patterns of member participation. We conclude by developing propositions concerning patterns of participation and how they change as settlements respond to internal and external pressures."
2017,"Managing Institutional Logics to Tackle Organizational Crises: A Tale of Two Railways Increasing attention is being paid to how hybrid organizations handle the tensions between contending institutional logics. However, intra-logic tensions regarding the decoupling of the internal components of the incumbent logics, the resultant organizational crises and how these crises are resolved, are understudied. This study explores how the Chinese and Indian Railways tackle organizational crises by reframing and recombining the means and ends components of contending logics. Based on comprehensive archival, interview and textual analyses, we find that the two railways maintained or shifted the incumbent logic to address organizational crises through remedial, manipulation, compromise and complementation strategies. We specify the mechanisms underlying each strategy, present a unified model and discuss the implications for research on hybrid organizations and crisis management."
2017,"A Multiple-Level Exploration of The Paradoxical Tensions in a Buddhist Temple Drawing on an ethnographic inductive study of a historical Korean Buddhist temple, we examine how Buddhist monks deal with the tensions of meeting the temples financial needs, while maintaining its isolated meditating traditions. Living with monks for three months, we conducted participant observations and in-depth interviews. Offering a multi-level perspective, we contribute to the paradox literature in two areas. At the organizational level of analysis, we find that the temple copes with the two sides of tensions by separating monks into two subgroups: business monks and meditation monks. Business monks shielded meditation monks by absorbing or blocking environmental pressures and freeing the meditation monks from organizational duties, while meditation monks enabled social legitimacy among business monks as members of a respected Korean Buddhist temple. The individual level of analysis revealed that business monks often suffered a psychological schism between their religious identity as a monk and their vocational identity as a businessman; meditation monks tried to remove tensions superimposed by the elements of tensions."
2017,"Group Moods Influence on the Top Team Diversity-Firm Financial Performance Relationship Contradictory findings from research examining the top management team (TMT) heterogeneity and firm performance relationship have resulted in calls to examine specific executive orientations and contextual factors that explain the conditions under which heterogeneity benefits firm outcomes. We answer this call by, first, examining the role of educational background, an executive orientation factor that is the foundation for TMT members cognition, on firm performance. Second, we examine an internal contextual factor, group mood, and argue that it moderates the relationship between TMT educational heterogeneity and firm performance such that positive group mood improves firm performance in educationally-heterogeneous TMTs, whereas negative group mood improves firm performance in educationally-homogeneous TMTs. We conducted an archival study of 48 TMTs from publicly-traded companies and find support for our predictions."
2017,"Blind to the Future:Managerial Hubris and Foresight in the Innovation Context Without managerial foresight, firms fail to see emerging future trends and suffer from performance disasters. Extending the current literature on the role of managerial cognition biases in strategic decision-making, we examine the impact of managerial hubris on the formation of managerial foresight. We propose that managerial hubris leads to a reduced level of foresight due to information-processing biases by hubristic executives. We further argue that hubristic executives will experience an even lower level of managerial foresight in an innovation context where the uncertainty level is high. With a unique two- wave survey of over 500 firms in different provinces of China, we find that hubristic executives tend to have a lower level of managerial foresight, and that this tendency is worse when a firm has a high level of R&D; intensity and if a firm is a high-tech firm. Our findings support our propositions. This study has significant implications for the understanding of managerial cognition biases in strategic management."
2017,"Delegation from the CEO to Top Executive: The Role of Workload and Decision-Specific Knowledge Theoretical literature on delegation demonstrated the relevance of the decision authority holders (DAHs) and decision authority recipients (DARs) knowledge. However, there is still a lack of empirical literature, which mainly focused on the DAH. In this paper we aim to contribute to this literature studying how the decision-workload of the DAH, her decision-specific knowledge and the one of the DAR influence the delegation of decision authority by the DAH to the DAR. We also investigate the interplay between the decision-workload and the decision-specific knowledge. In so doing, we focus on the delegation of a strategic decision in the dyadic relation between the CEO and the TMT manager responsible of that decision domain. Logit estimates on a sample of Italian firms partially confirm hypotheses. The CEO is more likely to delegate a strategic decision when her decision-workload increases, while she is less likely when her decision-specific knowledge increases. In addition, the negative effect of CEOs decision-specific knowledge is significant only for low values of decision-workload, while it does not matter when the CEO has too many strategic decisions to deal with. At the same time, TMT managers decision-specific knowledge matters only when the decision-workload is very high."
2017,"The Clock Ticks On, But in Which Half? CEOs Subjective Remaining Time And His/Her Risk-Taking Despite the anecdotal evidence suggesting the effect of individuals' subjective sense of their remaining time on their risk-taking behavior, the consequences of temporal constructs for managerial behavior have not received significant attention in corporate governance and more generally, strategic management research. Where CEO's remaining time has been considered (for example, in CEO career horizon research), the construction and the nature of time is ignored. Drawing from socio-emotional selectivity theory and prospect theory, the present paper proposes a theory of subjective time as an asset in risk-taking. Using data from S&P; 1500 firms, the present paper finds that CEO's subjective sense of his/her remaining time has a positive relationship with corporate risk-taking in the context of gain. In contrast, CEO's subjective sense of his/her remaining time has a negative relationship with corporate risk- taking in the context of loss. Moreover, the focal relationship is stronger for female CEOs in the context of gain and weaker for them in the context of loss. Contributions for career horizon research, corporate governance research, broader strategic management research on risk-taking, prospect theory and socio-emotional selectivity theory are discussed."
2017,"A Social Homophily Model of Political Ties in Emerging Economies While resource dependence theorists have indicated that firms connect with political powers for desirable resources, little attention has been directed at the social foundations that foster firms political ties. We develop a framework that specifies how the social homophily and heterophily of firms with political powers affect the formation of political ties in turbulent environments. We use data of listed Taiwanese firms that experienced an unexpected regime change to show that social homophily of a firm with the political regime promotes ties between them, whereas social heterophily of a firm with the political regime deters its ties with the regime. Some types of homophily persistently promote the firms ties to its original political ally despite environmental changes. However, such imprinted effects of homophily weaken when the firm operates in regulated industries."
2017,"On-again, Off-again: Corporate Political Actions in Transition Economies This paper addresses the loose connection between political and corporate governance and identifies the contingencies under which the connection facilitates or hinders corporate political actions. Specifically, we examine whether and when firms are more likely to engage in active and passive political actions simultaneously in the private sector of transition economies. Drawing on resource based view, resource dependence theory and institutional theory we argue that the nature of firms  being reformed or conventional  will affect their propensity of political actions in transition economies. This relationship is moderated by whether firms adopt modern governance measures and internalize political convictions. We test hypotheses using a unique firm-level survey dataset on nationwide samples of privately owned firms in China in 2006. Results lend substantial support to hypotheses."
2017,"Can a Stone Kill Two Birds? The Effects of Political Relationships on Supply Chain for New Ventures While research has established the importance of cultivating political relationship for businesses, how this affects new business ventures is less explored. Given the heightened resource constraints entrepreneurial firms face, does building government relationship help them in their critical tasks to ensure survival? We draw upon the resource dependence theory to develop arguments on how political relationships influence new ventures abilities to obtain stable suppliers and buyers. By enhancing their access to resources and reducing uncertainties, government relationships can help new ventures to attract more suppliers. However, by providing an alternative source of dependence, government relationships make new ventures depend less on buyers and can reduce the number of buyers. These opposing effects are further moderated for new ventures that differ in their access to resources. We test our arguments in the context of entrepreneurial firms in Chinas transitional market, using a survey of 345 new ventures in 2006 and 30 personal interviews. Our study contributes to research on political strategies by understanding their consequences for new ventures, and extends the resource dependence theory by understanding the impact of dependence-reducing action on a firms eco-system."
2017,"How Optimal is Distinctiveness? Category Heterogeneity and the Distinctiveness-Performance Curve Prior work investigating whether or not organizations should strive to be moderately different from others in their market category has yielded fundamentally contradictory results, with some identifying such an inverted U- shaped relationship between distinctiveness and performance, yet with others finding U-shaped relationships. In this paper, I show how the delegitimation and competition reduction mechanisms jointly driving the distinctiveness-performance relationship can yield both U- and inverted U- shaped effects, even under nearly identical assumptions regarding these mechanisms nature. In particular, I show how it is the relative strength of these mechanisms that determines the outcome that is observed, rather than the existence of two countervailing forces, per se. Given this, I develop the hypothesis that the distinctiveness- performance relationship shape-flips from a U-shape into an inverted U-shape as organizations within a category adopt increasingly heterogeneous positions. A topic model of 70,232 websites combined with results from a questionnaire with 2,262 participants from the Dutch creative industries confirm an average U-shaped effect that flips into an inverted U as category heterogeneity increases. Overall, this paper therefore suggests that there is no one optimal level of distinctiveness. Rather, what level of distinctiveness is optimal depends entirely on how distinct others in ones category are."
2017,"Finding the Threshold: A Configurational Approach to Optimal Distinctiveness This study contributes to a better understanding of how firms pursue optimal distinctiveness by strategically balancing conformity and differentiation. Leveraging interviews with 30 clean technology entrepreneurs in Canada, we sought to explain how firms successfully commercialize their technologies under various conditions. To do so, we advance the notion of a legitimacy threshold that firms must meet in order to successfully engage in strategic differentiation. We explain how this threshold is influenced by conditions both internal and external to the firm. Firms draw on entrepreneurial experience, collaborative strategies, and consistency framing to mitigate the presence of incumbent dependency, technology radicalness, and problematizing framing. We identified four pathways through which new entrants achieved commercialization success  two of which emphasize differentiation and two of which emphasize conformity."
2017,"Paying the Piper: Heterogenous Effects of Concept Taken-for- Grantedness on Code-Affirming Behaviors A large body of work in economic and organizational sociology underscores the constraining power of widely taken-for-granted market categories. Recent work by Hsu and Grodal (2015), however, provides a striking counterexample; in that study, the authors found that increasing taken-for-grantedness of a category enabled producers to avoid complying with category codes without being penalized. This was perhaps because audience members, such as consumers and investors, are less likely to closely inspect members of highly taken-for- granted categories. In this paper, we add nuance to these findings by highlighting how the effects of increasing taken-for-grantedness can vary depending the extent to which an organizations identity characteristics invite scrutiny. We test our arguments in the empirical context of Islamic banking, examining banks likelihood of making what are known as zakat payments. We find a u- shaped relationship between the level of Islamic ownership and the likelihood of paying zakat. However, as the Islamic banking category became increasingly taken-for-granted, banks with high levels of Islamic ownership became less likely to pay zakat, consistent with our theoretical arguments. In contrast, the taken- for-grantedness of Islamic banking did not impact the likelihood of zakat payments for banks with low levels of Islamic ownership. We discuss implications for the literatures on categories and authenticity."
2017,"Category Non-Conformity and Reputation Risk Taking in the Scotch Whisky Industry Research on market categories suggests that category non-conformity may reduce consumers willingness to purchase. But research also suggests that producers may take advantage of the taken-for-grantedness assumptions by consumers that all products within a category possess expected core features to strategically introduce non-conforming products. In this paper, we argue that when producers consider the advantages of introducing non-conforming products they also consider potential damage to their reputation, and thus balance the risk to their reputation against the gains that can be generated. We therefore also argue that producers with high reputation are more likely to introduce non- conforming products than producers with lower reputation, and once producers have observed the costs of non-conformity, high reputation producers are more likely to introduce more non-conforming products than producers with low reputation. We test this hypothesis using panel data of single malt Scotch introductions in the Scotch whisky industry during the period 2007-2015. Age has been a core feature of single malt Scotch whisky category since its emergence. A severe imbalance between rising demand and a supply bottleneck has led many single malt Scotch producers to launch no-age-statement (NAS) whiskies. We show that distilleries with high reputation for quality based on their products with age statement (WAS), and distilleries with high reputation based on differentiation, are more likely to introduce NAS Scotch whiskies. We also show that distilleries with high reputation for quality based on their products with age statement (WAS) are more likely to increase number of NAS whiskies than distilleries with low reputation based on quality reputation, but there is no difference between high and low reputation distilleries that is based on differentiation. Our study contributes to research that examines links between firm reputation and product non-conformity at the market category level. Our study also makes a contribution to recent research that argues that categories research should shift from emphasis on category stability, to the dynamics of category change."
2017,"Business Associations as Network Agents: A Meta-Organizational Systems Approach Although business associations play an important role in interorganizational-level collaboration and regulation, business associations have not been studied much in organizational studies. There are gaps between business associations and organizational theories. To lessen these gaps, I attempt to explain meta-organizations with organizational theories. Business associations as meta-organizations have a duality of purpose by their nature: their own prosperities and survivals, and their members prosperities and survivals. Propositions were drawn from their distinct duality of purpose."
2017,"Not Market, Hierarchy or Hybrid: Inter-Firm Relationships between Gray Marketers and Firms A number of transactions occur not in market, hierarchy or hybrid forms, but in gray markets, where organizations resources are allocated by unauthorized intermediaries. We aim to understand how this ungoverned inter-organizational relationship progresses over time. To achieve this, we conduct an inductive study of multiple cases in which global firms engage in transactions with daigou. Daigou is a Chinese word that refers to gray marketers buying products from overseas for residents on mainland China, though the term is now more widely applied. This emerging phenomenon extends gray markets to include students and tourists as microworkers as well as professional gray marketers. Our analysis suggests that relationships between firms and gray marketers are initiated unilaterally. Firms recognize their unintended involvement and attempt to assess the potential outcomes. However, their awareness and assessment processes are constrained by both internal and external factors. Firms then either enter a relationship maintenance phase, which in turn precipitates the growth of gray market businesses, or they try to dissolve the relationship though their efforts may be evaded by gray marketers. We integrate our findings into a process framework that depicts the relationship development process as a loop. Once involved, firms may find it difficult to terminate their relationship with gray marketers."
2017,"Through a Glass Darkly: Tracing the Mundane Organisation of a Bubble Network Despite the scholarly attention given to the causes of the Financial Crisis 2007-2009, there has been no research on the mundane organisation of the CDO (Collateralized Debt Obligations) market. By studying connections between supply-side actors, our paper examines structural developments in the CDO market. We treat the CDO as a network product, thus viewing the product as interface through which parties involved in the production interact. Our database contains interactions between supply-side actors involved in 373 US CDOs which are analysed using network analysis tools to draw out longitudinal structural developments and the centrality of actors. Our findings highlight how activity in the supply-side exploded after 2003 through the entrance of new actors as the market scaled up; however, actors present before 2003 remain central at the height of market activity in 2006/07, whereas new entrants appear to gain little traction. Crucially, the network exhibits a core-periphery structure centred on actors linked to mundane organising functions that have received little attention in previous studies, but where their central position may have contributed to the poor CDO market performance and financial crisis."
2017,"Project Screening and Resource Allocation in Boss-less Organizations A boss-less organization, where employees self-select to projects, have been an emerging phenomenon that has attracted attention of both scholars and practitioners. The proponents of this new form argue that it offers considerable advantages over the more traditional hierarchical approach. The empirical evidence, however, offers mixed results. This paper develops a simple agent- based model of open and hierarchical allocation to determine the mechanisms and boundary conditions of application of the two opposing modes of project selection and asset allocation. Our results suggest that the relative balance between the resources of the organization and number of opportunities it faces play a critical role in determining the efficacy of the two forms. We provide a detailed analysis of the mechanism and discuss potential applications of our findings to studies of industry evolution and firm size."
2017,"Structure Determined by Imprinting: Diversity Management in German Universities Universities face by increasing institutional pressures to conform to market demands. Following these demands, universities conform to a market-oriented institutional logic, such as by adopting management concepts that are common in the business world. Within this study, I will analyze the factors that influence the likelihood of adopting diversity management among 112 German universities. The results show that imprintingi.e., the influence of the founding institutional environmentdoes not affect the overall adoption of diversity management. However, by taking into account different administrative levels at which diversity management may be introduced, the findings show that imprinting affects the adoption of diversity management at higher-level structures. By discussing these findings, the study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that influence the diffusion of diversity management in universities as well as a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying processes of imprinting."
2017,"When and Where Does Workplace Diversity Pay? Institutional and Resource-Based Views We propose and test a theory of the value of racial minorities contribution to firm performance based on the demographic principle of proportional representation in the organization, community, and region. We conceptualize two demographic extremes, rarity and commonness in light of the predictions of institutional theory and the resource-based theory of the firm. Findings show that whether or not workforce diversity pays depends on proportional representation, which exhibits a curvilinear inverted U-shape effect. Diversity has a positive effect up to a threshold of 34 percent racial minority employees in the firm, but beyond the threshold firm performance declines. In theory, initial gains in firm profitability from the increasing legitimacy of a relatively rare minority hire erode with increasing minority hires because firm-based human and social capital resource shortages occurring after the threshold decrement firm profitability. Regional comparison suggests practicing legal services in the Midwest and South and in racially diverse communities in the Midwest and the South exhibit a stronger positive effect on firm performance, than in the Northeast and West."
2017,"Does Market Reward Diversity? The Impact of Board Gender Composition on Analyst Evaluation Current theories tend to focus on the consequences of board diversity only inside the boardroom. Departing from this conventional approach, this study argues that board diversity also serves as a market signal that could influence an organizations rating. I propose two theoretical processes. First, I extend institutional theory to suggest that an organizations perceived value depends not only on its conformity to institutionalized policies and practices but also on its conformity to demographic norms. Gender diversity on boards should increase a firms rating when its industry peers also have a high level of gender diversity on boards. Second, I extend the theory of in-group preference to organizations, suggesting that individuals from underrepresented groups should favorably evaluate organizations that have larger numbers of in-group members in leadership positions. In this case, gender diversity on boards should increase an organizations rating by female evaluators. I examine these hypotheses in the context of security analysts. Using a unique longitudinal sample of 239,298 security analyst ratings as well as robust dyadic fixed-effects models, I find strong support for both theoretical mechanisms. These findings show the importance of an organizations demographic composition to its market performance and the role of social context in moderating this effect."
2017,"Stretched Too Thin? The Paradox of Promoting Diversity in Higher Education We examine an important unintended consequence of diversity promotion in higher education. Specifically we demonstrate that departmental efforts to increase the representation of racial minorities, coupled with the limited supply of minority doctoral candidates, leads to an increased prevalence of joint appointments among minority faculty. This outcome is important as joint appointments overexpose faculty members to a set of unique risks that can negatively affect their career advancement. Using comprehensive administrative data from a large U.S. public university from 1990 to 2009, we find that African American assistant professors were four times more likely to be jointly appointed as compared to their white colleagues. We further find that the hiring and joint appointment of African American assistant professors is motivated in part by efforts to increase diversity within departments. Finally, we demonstrate that independent of race, being jointly appointed at the assistant professor level is associated with poorer career outcomes. Ceteris paribus, assistant professors that are jointly appointed in two or more academic departments receive smaller year-over-year raises as a percentage of their income and face lower likelihoods of promotion to tenure. Together, our results highlight the unintended costs of diversity promotion in academia whereby using joint appointments to achieve diversity goals at the level of the academic department can negatively affect the employment outcomes of minorities and work counter to diversity goals at the level of the university."
2017,"The Joint Effects of Social Network Positions and Performance Feedback on Risk Taking of VC Firms Despite the significant role of a firms social network advantages in its strategic decisions, the extant literature remains silent on their implications for firms risk- taking decisionsa central topic in strategic management. In this study, we focus on two important network positions, centrality and brokerage, and argue that the advantages arising from these network positions increase a firms tendency to take risks. Furthermore, integrating insights from behavioral theory of the firm, we argue that the proposed relationships are conditioned upon a firms performance shortfalls. Performance below aspiration weakens the positive effects of centrality but strengthens the positive influences of brokerage. Evidence based on longitudinal data from the Chinese venture capital (VC) industry provides empirical support for our arguments. Our results have important theoretical and managerial implications."
2017,"Network Structure, Partner Features and Performance: Evidence from Venture Capital Syndicates Although many research has been done to understand the consequence of network structure on performance at the firm level, we have limited knowledge regarding how network structures influence alliance performance and how they interplay with partner attributes in this process. Focusing on the venture capital (VC) syndicate networks, we argue and show evidence for the positive influences of internal network density and external network structural hole on the performance of the investee startups. Moreover, we investigate how the features of lead and non-lead VC firms interact with the two network structural variables. The findings suggest that a big syndicate team augments the benefits of cooperation and coordination from a dense internal network, but a lead VC firm with high network status strengthens the information benefits from a high level of external network structural holes. Our cross-level research offers important implications on partner selection in strategic alliance research and the roles of lead and non- lead VC firms in VC studies."
2017,"Is Homophily Always Beneficial? Task-Relevant Homophily and VCs Valuations and Returns We ask how social similarity between new venture founding teams and general partners of venture capital (VC) firms influences valuation of these ventures and subsequent financial returns of VC firms. Distinguishing between task-relevant and task-irrelevant social similarity, we argue they have opposing effects on valuation as well as on financial returns because the former type of similarity facilitates collaboration whereas the latter hinders it. We then suggest the differential impact of social similarity on valuation will be amplified when uncertainty is greater  such as for early stage deals and when the VC firms domain expertise in the focal ventures product market is low; or when VC firms status is higher. Novel data on venture valuation, VCs financial performance and social similarity on regional language (task-relevant similarity) and caste (task-irrelevant similarity) from 622 Indian venture financing events during 2005 to 2012 support our collaboration efficiency based mechanism."
2017,"Network Isolates: Entrepreneurial Bootstrapping & Social Disconnection in the Mobile App Ecosystem Extensive prior literature has studied how young organizations are impacted by and often benefit from embeddedness in key industry networks. Indeed, some research advises that entrepreneurs dont go it alone (Baum, Calabrese, and Silverman, 2000). This literature has also highlighted a dynamic whereby young organizations with higher quality are most likely to sort into these networks. Yet this perspective often fails to consider the drivers and prevalence of high-quality young organizations not becoming embedded, and instead remaining network isolates. Drawing on resource dependence and exchange theorys emphasis on network ties arising from mutual and balanced interdependence, we explicate how organizational design decisions, current performance, and competitive pressures influence whether a young organization remains a network isolate. We test and find support for our arguments using an unusually rich, complete, and large big data dataset that captures all competitors in the mobile app ecosystem on the Apple iPhone ecosystem over a period of 5 years, showing that a substantial fraction of high-performing mobile app developers remain outside of the venture finance network."
2017,"Family Ownership and SME Survival: The Role of Contingent Factors This study explores the impact of family ownership on the survival prospects of family small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and the moderating impact of contingent factors, including family involvement in management and control, and external competitive environments. An analysis of data from 315 Korean family SMEs in the IT industry during 1997-2014 reveals an inverted U-shaped curvilinear link between family ownership and survival prospects of family SMEs. Additionally, for family SMEs with active family involvement in management and control, the up-slope in the inverted U-shaped curvilinear link between family ownership and survival becomes stronger, while the slope on the right-hand side down curve of the inverted U-shape becomes weaker. In addition, for family SMEs in industries that encounter intensified global competition, the positive side of the inverted U-shaped curvilinear relationship between family ownership and survival becomes stronger and the negative side of the inverted U-shape becomes weaker. The implications of these findings for research and managerial practice are discussed."
2017,"Building on the past to create the future: family-advantage and naming strategies in NP introduction The introduction of new products (NP) is often seen as an attractive strategy that improves firm performance. However, because novelty can endanger local traditions and decrease attachment to existing stakeholders, launching new products can result in an arduous enterprise, in particular, in industries that value tradition. This paper elaborates on the resources and strategies upon which firms can rely to introduce novelty in traditional industries. In particular, family firms enjoy unique identity advantages over non-family firms that allows them to introduce new products in a legitimate way. This advantage can be better materialized when family firms make use of naming strategies by referring to their traditions in their product labels and serving geographically disconnected consumers. I test these predictions using data about more than 300 breweries in Franconia, a geographical cluster in Northern Bavaria (Germany) and one of the most traditional industries in Europe. The results of this study confirm that family firms are more likely to engage in the introduction of new beer types, especially those that are named using words that recall the traditional identity of the firm. Moreover, we also find support for the idea that these strategies are more common when firms serve geographically distant portions of the market."
2017,"Overcoming Time Compression Diseconomies of Organizational Emergence through Family Business Work In this paper, we applied a life course perspective to self- employment and developed a theoretical framework of the time compression diseconomies of organizational emergence. We theorized that working in family business, as opposed to just growing up in a business family, during adolescence facilitates individuals overcoming the time compression diseconomies of organizational emergence. These individuals are more likely to develop self- employment intention and become self-employed later in life. When they choose self-employment, they also financially outperform their peers. We found support for our theory using eight years of longitudinal data from the Youth in Transition Survey (YITS)."
2017,"The Dark Side of Embeddedness: When Family Relationships Give Rise to Malfeasance Research on embeddedness and social networks has shown that social relationships generate trust and dedication, but scholars have also surmised that social relationships may give rise to malfeasance. So which kinds of relationships tend towards malfeasance rather than dedication and trust? To answer this question, I study malfeasance in owner-top manager relationships in family firms located in Chinas Yangtze River Delta region. Drawing on detailed data on 932 owner-top manager relationships from 249 informants at 82 firms, I find that, relative to owner-nonfamily relationships, owner-nuclear family relationships are less likely to engender malfeasance while owner-extended family relationships are more likely to do so. I argue that this is because relationships generate trust only when the parties involved actually share high levels of emotional intimacy. When a relationship is nominally intimate, opportunistic actors may take advantage of the relationship to embezzle, steal, and commit other kinds of malfeasance. My study makes contributions to the literature on embeddedness as well as to the research on family businesses."
2017,"Consensus as Acceptance: A Reconceptualization of Strategic Consensus as a Decision-making Outcome Strategic consensus has a long history in the management literature, but studies have failed to demonstrate consistent findings specific to organizational performance. We argue the need for a new conceptualization, consensus as unanimous acceptance rather than simple agreement, and we develop three different types of strategic consensusnatural, deliberated, and acquiesced based on how the consensus is achieved within the dominant coalition. We argue that this conceptualization offers a better view of strategic consensus for two reasons. The first is that this view recognizes that participants can accept decision outcomes with which they do not agree and that doing so still represents a consensual decision by the group. This provides a richer, more nuanced view of consensus than the literature has previously acknowledged. The second is that each type of strategic consensus separately impacts firm performance in different ways. We offer propositions specific to each type of strategic consensus."
2017,"Paradox Multiplicity and Evolution We examine the co-existence of multiple paradoxical tensions and their evolution in the context of developing an online marketing and sales strategy within a large industrial multinational company. We employ Smith and Lewiss (2011) categorization of organizational paradoxes and explicate the tensions around learning, organizing, belonging, and performing between the newly established online unit and the traditional sales unit. Based on five rounds of in-depth interviews over the period of five years, we identified changes in the patterns of paradoxical tensions as the two units interacted and evolved. We discuss three forces that influence this evolution: the socio-historical conditions, the new units identity rhetoric, and the corporate strategy enacted by the top management. Our longitudinal case study provides insights into how and why paradox multiplicity emerges and changes over time."
2017,"Managerial Discretion and Strategic Change Prior research has associated low managerial discretion with a low organizational capacity for adaptation. The role of organizational members outside the top management team (TMT) in influencing organizational outcomes has, however, been overlooked in research on the effects of managerial discretion. Based on a case study of a technology company, I show that the TMT might relinquish a significant part of its discretionary power to employees outside upper management to enable them to contribute to the organizations adaptive capacity. Specifically, I develop a conceptual model that portrays strategic renewal as an outcome of the interplay between tight and loose coupling or, in other words, a TMT that maintains a system of tightly coupled complementary activity choices and other organizational members that are enabled to initiate organizational adaptations. These results lead me to reassess the managerial discretion construct and to suggest a multi-level conceptualization that considers managerial discretion in the context of the distribution of discretion across the organizational hierarchy."
2017,"Two Roads Diverged in a Logic Road: Cultural Entrenchment versus Strategic Search Post-Crisis The institutional logics perspective has received much attention in the management field. One of the clear struggles with institutional theory and the logics perspective in particular is how to deal with change. This theoretical paper offers a unique perspective on logics that accounts for when and why the overarching logics may change. I introduce a different conceptualization of logics  strong vs. weak logics  that vary depending on how tightly or loosely coupled material practices are with cultural beliefs. These logics correspond with different behavioral responses respectively: cultural retrenchment versus opportunistic search. Although difficult to ascertain during times of stability, the differences between the strong versus weak logics is useful for explaining different societal responses during periods of crises. 	"
2017,"Institutional Change and the Cultural and Biographical Outcomes of Social Movements The aim of this study is to further illuminate the intersection of the social movement and institutional theory literatures by employing a mixed methodology research design, integrating qualitative data with a quantitative dataset of over 19,000 social enterprises that have emerged from within Brazils solidarity economy movement (SEM) in attempt to remedy the grand challenge of inequality. We investigate the potential of social movements to influence institutional change by providing cultural and biographical outcomes to social movement participants and their communities. Findings indicate that social movements produce four unique forms of cultural and biographical outcomes  economic, social, political, and community. Additional findings suggest that social movement outcomes are achieved through ten key strategies that represent two broad categories of mechanisms - socialization and resource provision. Such outcomes, our findings suggest, reflect changes in institutional arrangements."
2017,"Defying Friedman Doctrine Where Its Hegemony is the Greatest: An SRI Fund in Hong Kong 	Why institutional arrangements persist is a foundational question in institutional research, but few studies have examined it from the perspective of institutional deviants. This study develops a process model of re-isomorphism to account for the rise and decline of institutional deviants as a new explanation for institutional persistence. Through qualitative data from a Hong Kong-based socially responsible investment (SRI) fund venture initiated between 2010 and 2014, this study explores why actors from the dominant social groups deviated from taken-for-granted norms, how they deployed deviance strategies to maintain their venture, and how they came to accept the institutionalized rules in the field. Reflecting on this ventures transition from intended defiance to de facto conformity, I conclude by discussing contributions to research on institutional theory, entrepreneurial teams, and corporate social responsibility."
2017,"Status Losers in Innovation Diffusion: An Empirical Study of Digital Cinema Camera Adoption Social actors making innovation adoption decisions face substantial uncertainties and risks if there is no way to externally validate the superiority of innovations at the outset of diffusion processes even though they demand adoption costs. Research has shown considerable influences of high status social actors in diffusion processes and lagged adoption by those with middling status. This study proposes an alternative view of status effects in diffusion processes by considering adoptersf variable risk tolerance and investigating the role of status losers in diffusion processes. We argue that those who experience loss of award-based status exhibit high risk tolerance and tend to adopt innovations as a gambit for gaining market recognition and regaining status, and that experts who confer award-based status reward status losersf innovation adoption. Our analysis of data on the adoption of digital cinema cameras by film production teams in the 2000s supports our theory."
2017,"Applying an Interorganizational Ecology Perspective to the Global Diffusion of Organizational Forms  The by-now omnipresent and largely taken-for-granted diffusion of organizational forms thought to advance market formation and socioeconomic development (particularly in transition and new-minted market economies) in various economic regions around the globe is well documented. Yet organizational sociologists lack a systematic framework for assessing the profound impact that these nonnative forms can have on the evolutionary trajectory of the organizational context in the adopting locale. By modelling this organizational dimension of global diffusion processes with concepts and empirical insights from population ecology, an evolutionary process model emerges that theorizes effects of form diffusion on firms that adopt nonnative forms, on the forms themselves and on the adopting organizational contextor, as population ecologists would call it, the community ecologyas a whole."
2017,"Under Pressure. Ceremonial Vs. Substantive Adoption of Practices in Business Organizations The necessity to obtain legitimacy through the endorsement of cultural and political authorities pushes organizations to adopt institutionalized policies. When such policies collide with established practices, organizations sometimes only pretend to comply to the institutional prescriptions in order to obtain legitimacy without losing efficiency. While such strategy has been often documented, it is unclear why and how such behavior occurs only at times. We shed light on this riddle through an in-depth empirical investigation of an organization that over the years was exposed to pressures to adopt various institutionalized policies and practices. Our findings reveal that practice adoption motivated by legitimacy-enhancing reasons does not necessarily translate into a simulation of compliance. Instead, whether this happens or not depends on a bottom-up sense making process aimed at evaluating the consistency of the practice to the needs of the organizations members."
2017,"The Paradox of Managerial Intuition One of the problematic issues in management intuition research is that scholars have tended to make intuition their substantive focus of attention; this is understandable, however it has led them, inadvertently, to not giving due consideration to intuitions relationship with its contrastive process, analysis. This is perhaps surprising given that many intuition researchers theorise intuition in dual-system or dual-process (intuitive/System1 and analysis/System 2) terms. This conceptual paper adopts Lewis and Smiths (2014) meta-theoretic framework for paradox theory and research and applies it to the intuition-and-analysis paradox. A framework is presented in which various processes are identified as reinforcing (e.g. vicious cycles of splitting or projecting) or resolving (e.g. virtuous cycles of correcting or catalysing) the tensions inherent within the focal paradox. These cycles result in further polarizations or productive synergies respectively. The implications for intuition and decision-making, paradox research are outlined along with some of the practical and pedagogical implications."
2017,"Cognitive Isomorphism: Effects of Management Ideas as Filters of Organizational Cognition In new institutionalism organizations are constituted by the institutions in their environments. In this theory, rationalized management ideas such as Lean Management or Total Quality Management are considered as constituting organizations. However, a research gap exists in how these management ideas influence organizations cognitive orientation, which is the central mechanism for increasing organizational isomorphism. Therefore, in this paper, we test how management ideas influence the cognitive attention of organizations. The results of the empirical analysis confirm the hypotheses that management ideas are a decisive factor for how organizations perceive their environments. Theoretically, these results stress DiMaggio and Powell (1983)s assumptions that the cognitive properties of the organizational level increase isomorphism."
2017,"Ignorance, Strategy and Complex Adaptive Systems Complexity and chaos have become one of most frequently applied notions in management theory and practice. From multitude of applications, the use of complexity studies ideas in strategic management deserves a special attention. Despite numerous attempts to investigate the problem of complexity and ignorance in studies on strategy, the gap in the strategic management literature still exist. The main aim of this conceptual/theoretical paper is to investigate what are the relations between knowledge and ignorance in applications of ideas taken from complexity studies in strategic management theory and practice. Two types of ignorance are analyzed. The ignorance identifiable in applications of the complex systems ideas in management theory, which is called second-level ignorance, and the ignorance which results from those applications, i.e. the ignorance which may be treated as positive from the point of view of development of theory and practice of management. As a result of the paper, a concept of new inter- and multi-disciplinarity is proposed. Accomplishment of this aim will allow to study a set of interfaces and four of them are the subject of a deeper scrutiny: knowledge vs. ignorance, complexity vs. ignorance, strategy vs. ignorance, knowledge vs. complexity."
2017,"How Context Affects Tie Formation: A Field Study Much research has studied how assortative and relational factors affect tie formation. Less attention has been given to the ways in which the environment or context in which interactions occur can affect the prevalence of tie formation. We explore the effects of contextual factors by observing nascent tie formation at a multi-day intra-organizational networking event where participants interact in a variety of different contexts. Using an app that records the exchange of digital business cards along with supplementary surveys, we find that more instrumental contexts are least conducive to tie formation; in other words, ties are most likely to form outside of the confines of the event and at the bar."
2017,"The Relationship between Friendship and Professional Advice in Multiplex Ties of Senior Managers Advice that senior managers access through informal ties in their professional networks constitutes an important strategic resource for their organizations. Since senior managers show preference toward advisers who are also their friends, in this paper I investigate the effect of friendship on professional advice that is provided by multiplex ties in senior managers professional networks. I test hypotheses using unique data on 710 dyadic ties of 54 Danish senior managers. The results of the study show that multiplex ties comprising both adviser and friend roles, at lower values of friendship, provide a benefit via additional advice at the marginal cost of that advices lower heterogeneity. However, at higher levels of friendship, the benefit of additional advice diminishes whereas the loss of advice heterogeneity becomes severe. The implication is that multiplex ties are not simply a sum of their parts, and that the strategic value of senior managers informal network ties is contingent on the roles the ties comprise."
2017,"The Origin of Strong Ties: The Role of Weak Ties in the Evolution of Alliance Networks Studies on the structure of alliance networks have explained how the formation, maintenance, and decay of local within cluster ties and shortcuts with semi-distant and distant organizations drive the emergence and evolution of small world architecture in such networks. Interorganizational ties are distinguished into strong and weak on the basis of their strength. Nonetheless, by focusing mainly on strong alliances ties, previous research has fallen short to explain the role of weak ties among organizations for the evolution of alliance networks. With the aim of scrutinizing the role of weak ties in the establishment, maintaining, and transforming of alliance ties, we develop a conceptual framework that looks at networks of interorganizational weak ties as conduits for the dissemination of information about knowledge sets that supports the processes of opportunity discovery and/or creation. The exploitation of the discovered or created opportunities leads to the activation of strong alliance ties and, hence, feeds into the evolution of alliance networks structure."
2017,"The Capacity to Innovate: A Meta Analysis of Absorptive Capacity and Its Performance Implications In this meta-analytic study, we aggregate 231 studies on absorptive capacity to ask fundamental questions to clarify the ambiguities underlying this important concept: What are the components of absorptive capacity and how is it measured? What factors influence the building and leveraging of absorptive capacity? How does it affect various attributes of performance? We find evidence to confirm the components of absorptive capacity and its effects on innovation outcomes. However, its effects on performance are limited when accounting measures are used, calling into question the assumption of absorptive capacity as a driver of financial performance. We also find that absorptive capacity is largely independent of firm size and age, suggesting that young and old, and small and large firms alike are equally able to develop these capacities. Our analysis provides much needed clarity on the antecedents, components, and outcomes of absorptive capacity, and highlights key areas for further theoretical and empirical development."
2017,"Effects of Learning from Failure, Leadership, and Knowledge on Ambidexterity and Firm Performance Research demonstrates that ambidexterity is often very important for achieving and sustaining firm performance. In this paper, we delve deeper into what influences ambidexterity and consequently firm performance. We suggest that learning from failure affects a firms ability to achieve organizational ambidexterity (that is, balance between exploration and exploitation activities), and further, given the important role of firm leadership in making strategic decisions, we examine how behavioral integration among members of the top management team affects the relationship between learning from failure and ambidexterity. Subsequently, we examine the important relationship between ambidexterity and firm performance by focusing on the moderating effects of two types of knowledge stock  market and technological. We test our conceptual framework using a sample of 235 firms. Our results indicate that learning from failure positively influences ambidexterity while top management behavioral integration weakens this relationship. Further, we find that market knowledge stock strengthens the ambidexterity-performance relationship, while technological knowledge stock weakens that relationship."
2017,"Organizational Search Strategy: An Examination of Interdependencies, Locus and Temporality of Search Notwithstanding the ample research on organizational search and its performance implications, the factors that shape the organizations search strategy is fairly under-explored. This study investigates how problems characteristics influence the managerial decision of searching jointly or independently for solving a given problem. We make a case where problem-solvers activities affect the landscape of the organizations future search. The empirical findings from developing an industrial software package across 13 versions and along 60 months demonstrate that the joint search is pursued when solving complex problems, involving cross- module interdependencies, whereas the problem-solvers opt for independent search efforts while searching in distant loci, discovering novel solutions. Moreover, the results show that in the short term (within stages of search) the software developers go for joint search, whereas in the long term (across stages of search) they resort to joint search activities. These insights complement the extant innovation and search literature by endogenizing the organizational search strategy decision, and thereby, exploring its determinants in a knowledge- intensive context."
2017,"The Two Faces of Political Embeddedness: Fundraising Performance of Charitable Organizations We investigate whether and how political connectedness contributes to fundraising performance of charitable organizations in an emerging economy. We highlight the associated benefit and cost of political embeddedness from a stakeholders perspective, arguing that the value of political embeddedness is contingent on the nature of embeddedness (political ties created at the organizational level vs. political ties formed at personal level), the identity of corporate donors, as well as the visibility of the charity. Based on a sample of Chinese charities during the period of 2005-2012, we find that the performance implications differ for the two forms of political embeddedness across different donors and charities."
2017,"Divided We Stand, United We Falter? Social Movements in Scotch Whisky Distilling, 1680  1940 Organizational forms rarely go uncontested, with various societal actor groups seeking to influence forms legitimacy, thereby affecting organizational vital rates. Yet our understanding of the effectiveness of social movement coalitions (SMCs), the banding together of these actors to jointly pursue shared goals, remains limited. Our focus is on the professional whisky distilleries of Scotland, from their emergence in 1680 until their mothballing in 1940. During a centuries-long struggle, temperance associations, the Church of Scotland, and Liberal Party politicians challenged distilleries on moral and legal grounds, framing them as sources of societal depravation and erosion of the moral character of the Scots. As a countermovement, whisky industry associations, in coalition with industry-sponsored charities and Conservative Party politicians, highlighted distilleries important economic role and their symbolic value as emblems of Scottish culture. Our analysis shows that both groups of actors, when acting alone in either societal or political arenas, had intuitive negative and positive effects on the survival of whisky distilleries. However, when banding together in coalitions, the net effects on organizational failure rates wane."
2017,"Janus-Faced Do-Gooders? Corporate Elites and their Influence on Philanthropic and CSR Priorities We investigate whether individuals are consistent in their value-based priorities across organizational settings. If personal values generate consistent priorities, then elites direct resources in a more comprehensive way than has been recognized to date. If priorities are misaligned then elites values are compartmentalized, with less far-reaching impact on societal outcomes. We first examine whether CEOs of firms with a good history of CSR involvement seek to express their social values across settings by joining the board of trustees of independent foundations. We then examine cases in which the same individual influences resource allocations made by two types of organizations: corporations, in the form of CSR efforts; and foundations, in the form of grants. Upper echelon theory predicts that the social causes they favor will be similar across settings, while the alternative view of moral compensation in psychology predicts that individuals compensate across domains, so that the corporate- and foundation-based allocations focus on complementary areas. We find evidence for behavioral consistency in the decision to join an independent foundation as a trustee, and of moral compensation in the selection of specific independent foundation and in the future allocation choices. We highlight the implications of our research to research on CSR and corporate governance."
2017,"Antecedents of Employees Co-mobility: Homophily and Organizational structure. This paper investigated the interrelationship between various dimensions of homophily as antecedents of tie formation in an Adhocracy. Exploring the general gap in the mobility studies, I investigate the co-mobility, or group transitions, between employees from a failed firm and treat them as instances of new tie formation. I use a unique, hand collected data on employees transitions after organizational failure and find that while the geographical homophily, or shared organizational loci, positively affects the likelihood of co-mobility between employees, the hierarchical homophily effects are not as salient. I further investigate the underlying mechanisms and find that strong ties between employees in an Adhocracy may be driving the results. Interestingly, employees from distant locations and in different hierarchical positions seem to have a higher likelihood of co-mobility which I explain with complementarities existing between employees in various geographical locations and based on market specialization within an Adhocracy. My findings extent the understanding of the antecedents of co-mobility and further advance studies on homophily within a particular organizational structure."
2017,"A Career Advancement Perspective on Interorganizational Job Mobility Although the dominant perspectives on inter-organizational mobility view it as a search process where workers seek the jobs that fit them best, we propose a contrasting perspective in which inter-organizational mobility is driven by an uneven distribution of lower-level versus higher-level jobs across organizations which forces many workers to move organizations to advance their careers. In proposing this career advancement perspective, we theorize the pattern of worker flows and its career implications for workers. First, we argue that inter-organizational mobility will tend to take place in systematic directions: specifically, that work will be moving into different organizations once they have accrued experience compared to when they enter the labor market. We also explore under what conditions organizations hire workers earlier versus later in their careers. Second, we argue that mobility out of the upstream firms that hire more inexperienced workers will be higher, even controlling for workers experience, as workers need to move firms to progress their careers. We find support for these predictions using matched employer-employee data on Swedish workers. We discuss theoretical implications for research on career mobility, organizations, and labor markets."
2017,"Why Married Women Cant Jump: Specialization and Early Career External Mobility Penalties This paper investigates the external mobility of women in their early professional careers after graduating from a top-MBA program in the United States. While scholarship in management, sociology, and economics has debated the merits and access to external mobility for women compared with men, the focus here is on the early career mobility of a specific subset of talented women to observe whether differences in external job opportunities occur among these high achievers. I find no evidence that women fare worse than men in terms of external promotions five to six years post-graduation, yet do find that some women are nonetheless penalized through the functional paths they follow within and across organizations in their early careers. Specifically, I observe a negative association between job function specialization and across firm promotions, and that married women are more likely to functionally specialize, revealing an indirect mobility penalty for married women through the functional paths they follow. The study informs organizational scholarship on mobility, gender and inequality by highlighting how seemingly equal mobility outcomes between men and women may still be unequal when functional paths inside and across firms are considered."
2017,"Occupational Concentration, Job Mobility, and Transition to Self-Employment Some occupations are prevalent across a wider range of industries than others. This paper compares how occupational concentration affects the mobility of workers within and across industries. Empirical results suggest that occupational concentration increases the probability of finding a job in the same industry while hurting chances of changing industries. However, it increases the probability of transitioning into self-employment in another industry. These findings provide support for the idea of self-employment as a mechanism for overcoming structural barriers to inter-industry mobility."
2017,"Bridging with Meaning: Organizational Vocabularies and Communication Networks in Organizations We examine how communication networks within organizations are structured by organizational vocabularies -- sets of words used by organizational participants to describe, interpret and share their personal experiences within hierarchically structured domains of activity. The basic question we explore asks: how does the overlap in organizational vocabularies affect communication and information sharing relations across formal organizational boundaries? We reconstruct the bipartite network between organizational participants and the words they use to describe their subsidiary company within a multi-unit group, and examine how dyadic patterns of association between participants and words affect interpersonal communication networks. In an analysis of the multilevel network linking managers both directly, as well as through their affiliation to words, we find that organizational members adopt similar vocabularies to describe their organizational units. However, overlapping organizational vocabularies per se do not imply that organizational members will be more likely to establish relations of task-related communication. Typically, organizational members tend to restrict communication ties within rather than between formal boundaries. Yet, overlapping vocabularies make organizational members significantly more likely to communicate and share information across the formal boundaries of their units. We discuss the role that organizational vocabularies play in sustaining knowledge transfer across organizational boundaries, thus bridging cultural holes within organizations."
2017,"Toward a Theory of Organizations Purpose: Linguistic Congruence, Antecedents and Consequences In this article, we develop the prolegomenon of a theory of organizational purpose. Our theorization is relational, i.e. purposefulness corresponds to the congruence in the interpretations of issues between a focal audience and the organization as observable in language. Using a formalism inspired from computational linguistic, we derive three linguistic antecedents of purposefulness (acceptability, consistency and issue prioritization) and introduce resource flows from a focal audience to the organization as the main consequence of interest. Our formalization notably allows researchers to define an organisations purpose in various ways, but always based on relational properties of the language used by the organisation to address its audiences. Our theorization paves the way to a fully- fledge descriptive theory of organizations purpose by 1) providing an articulation of extant micro and macro approaches, 2) bypassing moralistic or normative accounts of purpose and 3) facilitating causal identifications through the introduction of formal measures of the antecedents of purpose."
2017,"The Globally and Locally Embedded Meaning of Corporate Responsibility In this paper, we consider world society and glocalization theory to address both global and national influences on the similarity of the meaning of organizational responsibility (OR) reflected in the self- representations of big publicly listed corporations. We first investigate whether the usage of structural arrangements concerning OR is accompanied by a higher degree of similarity with respect to the global meaning of OR that organizations share in world society. Second, we investigate the relationship of organizations national embeddedness and variations in their adopted meaning of OR. To do this, we apply natural language processing methods to self- representations of large organizations from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany. We employ the results of this large- scale quantitative text analysis in our subsequent analyses to test our hypotheses about the role of both structural arrangements in the context of OR and organizations national embeddedness. On the one hand, the findings of our regressions indicate thatcontrary to our expectationsthe usage of structural arrangements does not explain a higher degree of similarity across organizations. On the other hand, we find that foremost national embeddedness explains remaining variations in the meaning of OR organizations reflect."
2017,"Gained in Translation: the Word Professionalism in the US and China. When the words used to interpret ideas and practices are translated from one society to another, their meaning cannot only change but expand. We provide a theoretical and empirical account of how the translation of the word professionalism from English to Chinese expanded the overall meaning of the word and thereby broke down barriers created by Protestant logics found in the US. Using cultural consensus theory (CCT) as a theoretical and empirical guide, we conducted a mixed method inductive examination of the behaviors that white-collar workers in the U.S. and China categorize as professional. For behaviors within work settings, we found areas of consistency in categorization both within and between societies. For behaviors within non-work settings, we also found consistency in categorization in China that mimicked the categorization of behaviors in work settings, but we found no consistent patterns within the U.S. These results suggest that the constellation of logics that shape the relationship between work and non-work spheres within societies shape the meaning of professionalism, which further guides practices in both work and non-work settings. Implications for research on professionalism, logics and vocabularies are discussed."
2017,"When the Fed Speaks: Arguments, Emotions, and the Micro-foundations of Institutions This study investigates what happens when a central authority figure makes explicit the taken-for-granted assumptions underlying an institution. Using all public speeches made by the Chairperson of the United States Federal Reserve from 1998 to 2014, I tested the relationship between the explicitness of assumptions within Chairperson arguments and market uncertainty, as measured by market volatility (i.e., the VIX Index). I found that exposing institutional assumptions to direct examination creates uncertainty and instability in the market. I also found that speeches conveyed in a more positive tone suppressed this effect, while higher levels of fear in the market before the speech amplified this effect. This study contributes a new perspective on arguments and emotions as micro-foundations of institutions, provides new insights for work looking at the sociology of financial markets, and more broadly opens new avenues of research on the relationship between language and institutions."
2017,"The Heart of Power and Resistance: Institutional Struggle as a Socio- emotional Concept of Power Power is an important and persistently thorny concept in institutional theory. Emotions have been speculated as a way to address institutional theorys lack of attention to power (Hudson, Okhuysen, & Creed, 2015; Voronov, 2014). However, institutional theory has drawn from several concepts of power from critical theorists; this has caused the concept of power in institutional theory to suffer from a lack of clarity. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to examine the role of emotions and power in institutional processes and the interplay between the two concepts. First, I explain how scholarship on emotions and inhabited institutionalism has brought a renewed interest of power as constituted of and shaped by emotions. Using Lawrence (2008) and Fleming and Spicer (2008) as jumping off points, I construct a conceptual framework of institutional struggle from which to analyze the interconnection between emotions and power in institutions. Institutional struggle is defined as a multidimensional socio- emotional and cognitive dynamic that animates the interface between power and resistance. Finally, I consider the implications of this framework for future research on emotions and power in institutions, inhabited institutionalism, and future institutional collaborations with critical scholarship."
2017,"Toward a Morally Reflective Institutional Analysis Using the example of institutional research on moral issues in organizations and management, we show that most studies neglect values as research object and/or as basis for reflection. The precarious status of values has again a negative effect on institutional researchs (practical) relevance and its theoretical reflexivity. Therefore, we develop an institutional theory that equally considers values as object of research and basis for reflection. We label this approach morally reflective institutional analysis. Such an approach can contribute as follows: First, in line with pragmatist thinking, a morally reflective institutional analysis puts specific focus on how findings may be used in practice. This takes account of the concern that institutional theory has lost of its (practical) relevance. Second, by combining normative and descriptive examination, a morally reflective institutional analysis similarly responds to institutionalists calling for more attention to values and those indicating the lack of value-focused reflection. Finally, by developing an approach that considers morality in its descriptive and normative sense, the study allows for merging the hitherto separated paradigms in management research on moral issues, i.e. a normative approach rooted in philosophy and a descriptive approach underpinned by the social sciences."
2017,"A Pragmatist Perspective on Institutional Worker Institutional worker has been largely under-theorized in existing institutional work research, which tends to make causal assumptions when designating actor. Drawing on insights from classic and relational pragmatism, this study peruses the three characteristics of institutional worker, i.e. goal-orientation, capability, and reflexivity, and develops situated and contextual understandings of these characteristics. Specifically, this research highlights 1) the role of reflexivity throughout problem solving, 2) the importance of decomposing intentionality, and 3) the value of indexicality as a lens for examining the realization of capability and the shift from action potentials to actual actions. Taken as a whole, our view of institutional worker as purpose-driven, situatively intentional, and contextually capable problem solver provides theoretical clues for defining actorhood and delineating its features in different empirical settings."
2017,"Ambivalent Relationships in Intra-Organizational Networks This study introduces the concept of ambivalent relationships simultaneously consisting of positive and negative network ties among colleagues. Focusing on individuals seeking problem-solving assistance from others that they find difficult to work with, we expose the consequences of ambivalent relationships for individual performance and uncover their origins in the workplace. First, we integrate psychological and network research and argue that ambivalent relationships trigger specific cognitive processes, thereby positively affecting performance. Second, we build on social exchange theory and hypothesize that different elements of the organizational architecture influence the creation of ambivalent relationships in the workplace. We empirically analyze multi-source data on engineers in a large manufacturing firm. Our findings confirm that seeking problem-solving assistance from difficult colleagues entails performance benefits. Moreover, we find that the co-occurrence of positive and negative network ties is driven by seniority, hierarchy, and unit membership, highlighting the role of vertical and horizontal differentiation for the creation of ambivalent relationships. We discuss the implications of these findings for organization and management theory."
2017,"Attention Biases in Social Networks This study examines how people connecting to brokers can receive high performance ratings in the workplace. Using survey data on communication networks among software engineers at a mobile service company, I find that independent of their ego network structure, individuals who pay more attention to brokers than to other communication partners receive higher performance ratings on project-based work than individuals who pay little (or no) attention to the brokers among their work colleagues. Although individuals should pay attention to brokers if they wish to receive higher performance ratings, I also find that people typically pay less attention to brokers than they do to other communication partners. The juxtaposition of these findings suggests that individuals have a systematic attention bias in social networks  that they do not normally allocate their attention in ways that benefit their performance ratings. I discuss the implications of these findings for research on attention and social networks in an organization."
2017,"Assessing Competence in Workplace? The Role of Network Ties and Proximity Networks as prisms is a useful perspective in networks literature, but it is limited by its focus on the network ties of the actor whose qualities are assessed; how these ties are perceived by others to infer underlying qualities of the focal actor is also a critical aspect that has not received sufficient attention. In this paper we focus on how individuals form perceptions about the technological proficiency of their colleagues by considering how much they are sought after in the work- related advice network. We theorize that individuals more proximal (in geographic, social and technological realms) to an actor whose competence is being assessed, rely more strongly on the number of colleagues seeking the actors advice to assess the actors technological competence than individuals more distant from the actor. Our empirical testing using a dyadic data in a R&D; lab of a large semiconductor manufacturing firm provided support for this framework. These findings have implications for research on networks and competence assessments."
2017,"Self vs. Altercentric Selection into Structural Holes and the Psychological States of Brokers  From a cross-sectional view of social network structure, bridging positions are seen to be an asset due to the ability to receive information more quickly and arbitrage it across groups. However, we know relatively little about how egos trajectory into a structural hole impacts their psychological state. Seen from the point of view of an individual moving forward in social time and space, entry into a structural hole might be perceived to be less of a static resource than a move away from the comfort of an insulated group into less familiar social territory. I use a comprehensive database of over 30 million calendar meetings to measure changes in employee meeting networks, and show that within-person increases in network brokerage are associated with increased social risk aversion (avoidance goal orientation). On the other hand, moving into more closed, cohesive communities is associated with increased confidence about taking social risks. To control for self-selection into bridging positions, I estimate network brokerage separately for incoming and outgoing meeting invitations, and show that those who are altercentrically selected experience increased uncertainty, whereas, those who self-select, or actively bridge the structural hole are less impacted."
2018,"Institutional Work and the Maintenance of Doping: The Case of Professional Cycling Based on an in-depth historical examination of doping in professional cycling and how despite nascent anti-doping efforts doping became more sophisticated, we develop a process model of institutional maintenance. Our model reveals how actors in the professional cycling community engaged in institutional work that allowed doping to be maintained through micro level processes that supported the recruitment and retention of riders onto doping programmes while protecting the doping system from anti-doping efforts. Further, while acknowledging the need to clean up the sport, a decoupling process occurred where professional cycling gave the impression of adopting anti-doping measures while in reality the doping culture of the past continued. We identify that doping is a specific type of social activity that was culturally embedded and accepted within professional cycling, supported by a wider network of stakeholders. Whilst the number of positive dope tests have reduced suggesting that anti-doping measures are being successful, riders are still testing positive suggesting that doping as an institution has evolved and changed with a reconfiguration of the institutional structures that support doping augmented by new types of institutional work."
2018,"Floating Ferraris: Visual, Material, and Historical Elements of Institutional Work In this paper, we explore how organizations integrate visual and material elements with rhetorical history as part of institutional work projects. We focus specifically on how organizations embrace contested, painful, or tainted historical events through the use of visual and material elements. Empirically, we draw on a series of oral history interviews and secondary sources to examine the work of Martin Litton and his organization Grand Canyon Dories to understand how naming each dory after a unique natural wonder that had been previously destroyed helped to build an army of citizen activists. We contribute to institutional theory by illustrating how unique types of visual and material elements can be used to simultaneously remember a painful past and protect an imagined environmental future. We also extend research on institutions and place, as a type of material element, by conceptualizing how places that have been previously destroyed can continue to endure through memories, visual experiences, and material objects. Finally, we contribute to the literature on rhetorical history by demonstrating how organizations can draw on exogenous historical accounts as a means to create strategic value from contested, painful, and tainted historical events."
2018,"Individual Institutional Learning behind Stakeholder Logic and CEO Succession Choice What motivates directors to deviate from the prevalent corporate governance practice of appointing a white male CEO to select a woman or a minority CEO? Drawing on insights from the sampling approach in social psychology, we develop an adaptive learning framework to predict how adoption of such a deviant practice is affected by directors institutional learning. Specifically, we analyze how the stakeholder logic may transform directors institutional knowledge by motivating them to seek strategic inputs from women and minorities. These interactions weaken directors adherence to cultural status beliefs about group differences regarding who is better for leadership positions, and increase the likelihood that they appoint a woman or a minority CEO. We also find that the influence of the stakeholder logic is contingent on directors local social structures. Overall, our study contributes to the micro-foundations of institutional research as well as to the corporate governance and organizational inequality literatures."
2018,"Is Platform Capitalism Legit? Ask the workers To endure, new forms of organizing must be perceived as legitimate. This study brings to the forefront the overlooked perspective of workers as they discuss an organizations novel solutions to the universal problems of organizing, pertaining to the division of labor and integration of effort. Using the platform economy as our empirical context and utilizing a topic-modeling analysis of 120,116 forum posts on uberpeople.net  the most popular forum for Uber drivers  we investigate the drivers perspective on Ubers platform capitalism  representing the dominant form of organizing in the platform economy. We draw on theories of legitimacy of new organizational forms and institutional environment, while using framing as the lens, to reveal that workers do not always succumb to the organizing solutions imposed on them and instead act as active contributors and evaluators. In addition, we show how different regulatory environments shape workers legitimation of organizing solutions. Our findings offer several important contributions to the literature on legitimation, new organizational forms, and institutional environment."
2018,"Goliath in the Age of Digitization: Online Platform Network Structure, Content, and Power Dynamics Online platforms such as Twitter and Amazon have disrupted the previous economies of scale and enabled the new way of organizing. Using the Twitter network structures and conversational contents on eBooks between 2014 and 2015, this paper studies how the power dynamics in the U.S. publishing industry have shifted with the introduction of industry platforms such as Twitter. I find that established players such as the Big Five publishers benefit more from the diffusion of information through social media networks as well as from the buzz created through contents. While industry platforms have been believed to democratize industries, the results from this study explain that the underlying network structures and diffusion of information give advantages to the already powerful ones."
2018,"Economic Correlates of Diversity and Inequality Online Social Networks In this paper, we address the theoretical puzzles regarding the distributional relationship between network positions and the economy through individual- and country-level analyses of Twitter communication networks. Constructing within- country Twitter communication networks, we measure each user's network social capital by well-known network metrics. Through an analysis of housing price and network position for a sample of U.S. Twitter users, we first establish the validity of using Twitter communication networks as a proxy for measuring network social capital. We then use a larger sample of Twitter users across multiple countries and combine it with national economic indicators of per capita GDP and income inequality to show that the individual network positions as well as the inequality in the distribution of those positions at the country level both correlate with national indicators of economic development and income distribution."
2018,"Topic diffusion and intra-organizational interaction: The case of hedge funds. Understanding how information is exchanged can provide insights into the different organizational mechanisms. The topic has been widely explored in the social network literature, with a primary focus on the structure of ties channeling information. In this paper, we focus both on the structure and the content of ties, exploring how information from the external environment spreads within the organization. In order to reach our goal, we explore instant messages (IMs) exchanged among employees of a hedge fund and their outside contacts (e.g. other hedge funds, banks) along three years. We find that each information topic has different spread patterns. Moreover, we find that the differences in the spread are also related to ties structure and actors characteristics. We bring important contributions to social network literature, showing the importance of considering ties content and structure, and to research on words and vocabularies, highlighting how information exchange shapes organizational dynamics."
2018,"The relationship between identity and collective professional misconduct There is a long-held belief that professionalism brings safeguards against misconduct. A recent spate of high profile collective misconduct scandals in professional organisations has brought this assumption into question. Our study seeks to understand the misconduct of professionals and how this influences, and is influenced by, their identity. Empirically, we draw on an account of a large-scale organisational failure in a public sector organisation. We illustrate how under conditions of extreme identity-threat, professionals attempt to safeguard themselves by ignoring or legitimising misconduct, and somewhat paradoxically by identifying themselves more strongly with their organisation. In doing so, we note how identity tensions can lead to over-identification with the organisation and under-identification with professional codes of conduct. By focusing on identity processes at the individual level, our study theorises how professionals restructure their identity to justify, or not, serious acts of misconduct. In professional ethics being replaced by organisational goals, increasingly extreme acts of misconduct are tolerated. Importantly, our conclusions suggest that once collective misconduct is embarked upon, identity can become encapsulated, preventing the possibility of correction."
2018,"Stick or Yardstick? Organizational Misconduct, Social Control Agents, and People Voice Organizational misconduct has taken center stage in sociological and organizational research. A growing social constructivist perspective perceives misconduct as the result of the the interaction between transgressors and a social-control agent. Current research, though, focused primarily on misconducts consequences for the transgressors (or its affiliated organizations) and on one type of norm violation. In this paper, we rebalance interest and analyze how general audiences (people) react directly to the decisions of a social- control agent involving two types of norm violation (rule-based and value-based norms). Using complete data on UK citizens complaints against corporate advertising over the period 20072010, we find that people complained more when a social control agent, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), decided to ban advertisements that violated rule-based as opposed to value-based norms. Through a survey and an experiment, we establish that rule- based norms generate more agreement with the ASA decisions (as opposed to value-based norms) and that agreement is the mechanism that mediates the relationship between the publication of ASA banning advertisements and peoples future complaints. Our study brings peoples actions to the fore and contributes to research on organizational misconduct by considering the social-control agent not only an evaluating actor, but as an evaluated one."
2018,"The consequences of detected misconduct in and by organizations This paper advances organizational research on wrongdoing by studying the effects of publicly known connections to misconduct on the futures of front-line workers, managers, and their organizations. Specifically, we make two sets of comparisons of the outcomes of misconduct. First, we compare negative effects of known misconduct for front-line workers relative to managers and the organization in which the misconduct occurs, seeking a better understanding of the variation in consequences experienced by each for the same infractions. Second, we compare the effects of misconduct when it results in media-driven scandals and culminates in formal social control agent involvement. Our empirical context is performance enhancing drug use among professional cyclists from 1999 through 2011, a setting that allows the collection of data on all athletes, managers, and organizations in the industry as well as both prosecuted and suspected misconduct. Results demonstrate that front-line workers (cyclists) experience harsher penalties than managers as the result of public connections to doping. Organizations are most likely to disband when the misconduct escalates into media-driven scandal and provokes social control agent involvement."
2018,"Making Sense of Scandals: Suffering, Identity, and Theodicy Our theoretical analysis illuminates that theodicy, which reconciles the conflict between the sacred and the profane, is an important sensemaking strategy for organizational members to cope with suffering resulting from scandals. We map Webers (1922/1993) classic typology of theodicy (predestination, dualism, and karma) onto a typology of organizational identity (collectivistic, relational, and individualistic identities). We highlight the synergy between predestination and collectivistic organizational identity, the synergy between dualism and relational organizational identity, and the synergy between karma and individualistic organizational identity. When scandals jeopardize organizational identity, people who highly identify with an organizational identity will use the synergistic theodicy to make sense of the scandals. Furthermore, these sensemaking strategies will differentially impact the wrongdoers career in terms of the risks of dismissal and voluntary turnover  dualism-relational identity tends to be more tolerant; karma-individualistic identity tends to be more rational; and predestination-collectivistic identity tends to be the least compromising."
2018,"Showing Boards True Colors: Using Role Theory as Processual Lenses to Understand Board Behavior Boards of directors are social entities and therefore social dynamics are key to understand board decision-making. The major theories in corporate governance nonetheless do not account for this social aspect. In this paper, we develop a theoretical model that can capture the social aspect of the interaction between directors on boards. We invoke role theory to stress how the behavior that each director exhibits in the boardroom is strongly dependent on the social roles that s/he has on the board. In turn, these enacted behaviors are not only shaped by the social norms and social dynamics (i.e., scripted behaviors) but also by the directors own interpretations of what behaviors are associated to such roles. This difference between scripted and enacted behaviors allows for the possibility that directors with the same characteristics and incentives could exhibit unlike behaviors in the boardroom. At the board level, we denote the level of divergence between the scripted and the enacted behaviors board role-set deviance and posit that this difference constitutes a fruitful perspective for understanding how the social dynamics in the boardroom affect board effectiveness. We also illustrate how the board characteristics in the form of board composition and board power, influence the relationship between board role-set deviance and board effectiveness."
2018,"Afraid to Monitor? How Board Climate and Shapes Outside Directors Monitoring of Executives Outside directors monitoring of executives involves individual directors taking social risks and, we argue, is likely to be shaped by the social climate within boards. Inductive analyses of video-observations and in-depth interviews of board meeting participants in five Australian boards revealed that psychological safety climate within boards plays an important role for outside directors engagement in monitoring. Interestingly, beyond traditional agency- logic arguments of a dominant role of the chair, chair leadership was found to increase monitoring of executives, not by the chair taking center stage, but rather by engaging in participative leadership behaviors; stimulating fellow directors engagement in monitoring and creating a psychologically safe environment within the board. We corroborate these results with a second, large-scale survey study, involving data on 310 outside directors from 65 Dutch boards. All in all, these results strongly advocate the importance of board psychological safety climate for monitoring executives and in so doing provide important implications for extant thinking on chair leadership and governance effectiveness."
2018,"Who gets attention? Firms shifting stakeholder orientation at times of ownership volatility Research on firms stakeholder orientation has described two perspectives: An ex ante narrow orientation towards their shareholders and an ex ante broad orientation towards all their stakeholders. Both streams rely on the assumption of long-term owners, who create spillovers to other stakeholders or enable synergies between stakeholders and shareholders. However, stock-holding periods have become much shorter over the past decades, causing unprecedented ownership volatility. In this paper, we clarify the impact of ownership volatility on stakeholder orientation. Drawing on an attention perspective, we argue that two distinct mechanisms are at play: First, an increase in ownership volatility attracts managers short-term situated attention, leading to a narrow orientation to shareholders. Second, a constantly high level of ownership volatility affects managers long-term focus of attention, motivating a broad stakeholder orientation. Based on an empirical study of more than 1,300 firms, we find evidence for our arguments. Our main theoretical contribution is that firms stakeholder orientation is not set ex ante, but changes over time with ownership volatility."
2018,"The Effect Of E-Voting On Excess Control In An Emerging Economy For several decades, corporate governance research has debated board of director and shareholder relations. Focusing mainly on corporate laws, protocols, rules, ownership, and influence themes, this discussion suggests shareholders are seen as relatively powerless to directly influence the board and its decisions. With a growth in shareholder activism, however, and an allied debate on different forms of governance, the direct influence of shareholders on the make-up and selection of board members is an increasingly acknowledged but under-explored aspect of this relationship. Focusing on one element of activism, this paper considers the adoption and use of electronic voting (e-voting) for board elections in emerging economies, testing its effect on the excess control of controlling shareholders, and its impact on firm performance. Using a sample of elections at 809 publicly-listed Taiwanese companies, results challenge convention on governance and on shareholder democracy. In contrast to an expectation that shareholders capitalize on their e-voting rights, and that this type of voting decentralizes the disproportionate control rights of controlling shareholders, adopting e-voting leads to an even greater level of excess control, which subsequently harms firm performance. This distorted voting effect is more pronounced in firms characterized by a pyramidal control structure and family-controlled firms."
2018,"Sector Legitimacy and Financial Sustainability of Organizations: Evidence from a Natural Quasi-Experiment Businesses serving the base-of-the-pyramid markets employ different models in balancing the organizations social and commercial logic. Relatively little is known about how shifting legitimacy in the business environment can heterogeneously impact the financial sustainability of for-profit and non-profit organizations. Drawing from the insights of organization theory, management and economics literature, this inter-disciplinary study examines how financial sustainability outcomes differ among organizations as a consequence of the sector legitimacy loss. This research investigates the effects of the sector legitimacy loss experienced by the microfinance organizations during 2010-12 in the aftermath of suicides committed by debt-laden microcredit borrowers in India. The findings suggest the sector legitimacy loss was associated with significantly adverse effects on financial sustainability of the Indian microfinance organizations, however, the adverse effects of sector legitimacy loss were substantively stronger for the for-profit than the non-profit organizations. Further, we find heterogeneity within the for-profit organizations. Evidence suggests that the for-profit organizations with greater visibility suffered stronger adverse effects of sector legitimacy loss, whereas the for-profit organizations with greater financial slack were able to sustain better."
2018,"The Legitimacy-Legality Nexus of Industries: Exploring Changes in Medical Marijuana and Payday Loans Research in the sociology of organizations regularly examines industries from the perspectives of industry legitimacy and legality. Within this line of research, conventional wisdom suggests legitimacy and legality are mutually reinforcing rather than orthogonal. This received wisdom, though often true, blurs potentially important distinctions between the two. When viewed as orthogonal, explanations about the institutional forces confronting industries include separate combinations of legitimacy-illegitimacy and legality-illegality. These combinations form separate spaces of economic activity that exist around a legitimacy-legality nexus that include the renegade (illegitimate and illegal), informal (legitimate but illegal), and formal (legitimate and legal) economies. In this article, we explore configurations of legitimacy types found in media representations about two industries occupying separate spaces of economic activity. Our results confirm existing theoretical explanations about the existence of the renegade, informal, and formal economies. In addition, we extend existing theory by identifying a fourth space of economic activity we define as the shadow economy (illegitimate but legal). We develop a new framework of the legitimacy-legality nexus of industries that incorporates the shadow economy and propose associations that predict changes in the treatment of industries around the nexus. This analysis is based on the medias portrayal of industry activities as cognitively, pragmatically, morally, and sociopolitically legitimate or illegitimate."
2018,"Expert Control of Market: Chartered Financial Analysts and Index Funds Index funds persistently perform better than actively managed funds as investment products but passive investing remains a minority in the market. Extant literature provides much insights into explaining this puzzle but mainly relies on an economic and instrumental rationality. To provide a fresh perspective, we bring in an institutional analysis of financial markets and leverage the research on expert control. We suggest that chartered financial analysts (CFA) program, the most important global institution that produces experts in active investing, play a crucial role in containing the growth of index funds and that, to do so, these investment experts exploit the economic and institutional conditions of markets. We test and confirm our predictions with a sample of 20 countries between 2000 and 2012. We contribute to research on financial markets and expert control."
2018,"Authenticity and Institutional Context: An Empirical Study into Individual Preferences in China This paper explores how and when the institutionalized classification system for products (or services) in a specific market domain affects perceptions and demand for authenticity. We argue that type authenticity presupposes a well- established and taken-for-granted classification system for a product or service. In market domains with such systems, individuals will place greater value on products or markets that exhibit high type authenticity, and craft, moral, or idiosyncratic authenticity will be less salient. By contrast, in market domains without institutionalized classification systems, individuals will prioritize craft or moral or idiosyncratic authenticity over type authenticity. To test these arguments, we conducted experiments and a survey in China where we asked participants to express preferences and make choices about products described to evoke various types of authenticity. We also ask these individuals to assess the authenticity of the producers as well as their willingness to pay for associated products. Specifically, we test the arguments with data on the appeal of various fictitious producers of leather handbags and green tea among Chinese individuals. While the leather handbag is known in China, it is not highly institutionalized whereas white tea is. The findings generally support our hypotheses."
2018,"Social Network and Cooperation with Strangers Cooperation with strangers in one-shot encounters poses a puzzle that is difficult to reconcile with perspectives of rational self-interest and natural selection. The quality of prior social experience offers a possible explanation, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We hypothesize that people in more closed social networks are less likely to cooperate with a stranger. Further, success reinforces the network predisposition. Regardless of the reason for success, people who have enjoyed success with the network they have feel that their network is a good one. Our second hypothesis is that successful people with a closed social network are reinforced in their social behavior, and are therefore especially unlikely to cooperate with an outsider. Both hypotheses are strongly supported by network and behavioral data on a stratified area probability sample of 500 CEOs in Chinas Yangtze River Delta region. Learning seems the most likely causal mechanism driving our differences in cooperation with strangers."
2018,"Open versus Closed Alliance Networks as a Precaution for Organizational Disruptions This study explores effective alliance network structures that prevent organizational disruptions by focusing on two types of structures: open and closed alliance networks. Open and closed alliance networks both have potential effects that may help organizations prevent unexpected disruptive events. The former offers organizations great accessibility to diverse knowledge throughout the alliance network that may lead to organizational learning for the prevention of disruptions. The latter generates a social sanction that makes the organization mindful against disgraceful disruptions that may harm their trustworthiness in the alliance network. This study hypothesizes that the latter is more essential for preventing disruptions, and tests the hypothesis using longitudinal data of airline accidents or incidents and code-sharing alliances in the global airline industry. The analysis results show that (1) organizations in a closed alliance network are less likely to experience disruptions, and that (2) such a tendency strengthens when the organizations are stigmatized by their own previous disastrous events, and ultimately disappears when the industry is stigmatized by a disastrous event at the institutional level. The implications for the literature on organizational disruptions and strategic alliances are that organizational mindful behaviors to maintain trustworthiness are an important mechanism for preventing organizational disruptions, and that strategic alliance networks induce such a mechanism."
2018,"Better Off Friends? Network Bounding and the Performance Implications of Formalization This study introduces a theory of network bounding, which pertains to the formalization of informal network relationships. Network bounding views formalization of a group as the establishment of a new, formal boundary within a broader system of network interactions. The theoretical significance of the formal boundary may provide new perspectives on the social processes that underlay the interplay between informal and formal relationships. In particular, we study the interorganizational context where formal partnerships occupy a strategically and socially important space between informal interactions and integration into a single organizational boundary. We argue that a formal boundary may alter the evolution of informal network ties, altering rules of engagement within and across the dividing line. Subsequently, these changes in informal structure may be an important mediator of group outcomes and performance of the formal group. Further, we investigate the potential externalities associated with network bounding, examining whether non-members may be indirectly affected by this change in their social environment. Using medical claims data before and after the introduction of the Medicare Shared Savings Program Accountable Care Organizationsformal networks among healthcare providers in the U.S. healthcare industry we examine the effects of network bounding on patient mortality following cardiac surgery from 2008-2014."
2018,"Diversity by Design: The Role of Contact and Homophily in Determining Persistent Friendships  Organizations regularly divide members in ways that maximize diversity, yet it is unclear whether efforts to induce diversity are effective in producing lasting ties. In this paper, we explore the extent to which an organization can induce diverse networks in small groups versus large groups, and in the short term (while induced contact persists) and in the long term (after induced contact ends). We evaluate this in an incoming MBA cohort as they are assigned to 70-person sections and five-person learning teams, both intended to maximize diversity and facilitate diverse ties. We find that, whereas the larger sections result in homophilous friendships, the smaller learning teams foster diversity. The latter result, however, is limited; once requirements to work together in learning teams are removed after the first year, those diverse friendships dissolve more rapidly than other friendships."
2018,"The Double Edge of Hybrid Legitimation Using a case study of an American hybrid dish, Jell-O Salad, I develop a model to explain how a well-accepted hybrid becomes delegitimized through the mechanism that legitimizes the hybrid in the first place. Drawing on institutional research on legitimacy while integrating ideas from category literature and cultural consumption studies, I conduct a historical process analysis of 228 Jell-O cookbooks and recipe booklets from 1902 to 2005. The analysis reveals a mechanism, status evocation, which brings a desired status to the mind of the immediate audience. Whereas the mechanism helps a hybrid become widely accepted, it gradually dissociates the hybrid from higher status with which the hybrid is apparently associated. When this dissociation is publicly known, detachment from the hybrid is the way to evoke ones desired status. Consequently, the once-popular hybrid is no longer accepted. Based on these findings, I develop an alternative model of legitimation suggesting that the legitimation of a hybrid carries within it the seeds of its own delegitimation."
2018,"Structural Adaptation and Hybrid Organizing: Fostering Multilevel Hybridization Processes In this paper we explore how adaptations in organizational structures can enable a hybridization process. We provide a longitudinal investigation of the evolution of the structural arrangements and related interactions between two key layers of the organization, that is, the top and the middle management. Although extensive research has shown that either differentiated or integrated structures can sustain hybridity, we know little about how their combination impacts hybridization efforts over time and how these two structural solutions unfold at different organizational layers. We address these gaps through a seven-year inductive study of Alpha, a social venture that has adapted its structural arrangements to manage the hybridization of its original social orientation with practices and activities informed by the commercial logic. Our findings show that the alternation over time of integrated and differentiated structural arrangements facilitated the peaceful recombination of different logics, and that this alternation occurred asymmetrically at different organizational layers. We also show that changes in structural arrangements unfolded whenever organizational members could not achieve either vertical or horizontal coordination due to a lack of shared interpretative schemes about organizational priorities. On the basis of these findings, we develop a process model that explains how organizations preserve stability while adapting and changing to integrate divergent logics. In this way, we contribute to research on hybrid organizing, hybridization processes and organizational structures."
2018,"Keeping an Eye on Two Goals: Governance and Organizational Attention in Hybrid Organizations Drawing on an inductive comparative case study of eight work integration social enterprises (WISEs) in France, we examine the unique governance challenge that hybrid organizations face: maintaining their attention on the joint pursuit of their dual social and commercial goals. We find that WISEs with governance actors (that typically include board members and top managers) who collectively represent both the social welfare and commercial logics are more likely to maintain their focus on the organizations dual goals. However, they are also more likely to experience governance crises that monopolize governance actors attention, distracting their strategic focus from the joint pursuit of its dual goals. Finally, our findings suggest that WISEs with diverse governance actors can avoid governance crises when they rely on governance arrangements that ensure both stability in the allocation of decision making rights between representatives of the social and commercial logics and the existence of integration mechanisms that foster mutual understanding between the governance actors who represent the social logic and those representing the commercial one."
2018,"Compartmentalizers or Hybridizers? How Individuals Respond to Multiple Institutional Logics Addressing a gap in extant research on individual responses to multiple institutional logics, this paper aims to understand why certain individuals resort to compartmentalization while others turn to combination. Relying on a qualitative inductive research design, we conducted a comparative case study of the life stories of 14 high net worth individuals to explore the factors that led some to practice impact investing, a hybrid practice blending features of giving and investing, thus combining the logics of philanthropy and finance, while others rather compartmentalized them, keeping their giving and investing activities distinct. We develop a five-stage model revealing the cognitive factors that either enable or hinder individuals ability to become hybridizers: their relative adherence to the field logics at play (philanthropy and finance), but also to the societal logic of religion, the availability of opportunities, and their personal identity."
2018,"Donor Darlings and Orphans: Category spanning in humanitarian projects Organizations are evaluated with respect to the social codes that define the industry category to which they belong. Organizations that span categories are at a disadvantage in terms of the attention they receive from the audience, and consequently their overall performance decreases. Whether to span categories in products or services is an internal decision. This internal decision can also be supposed to be dependent on audience evaluation criteria: thus, decision makers should be reluctant to initiate projects that would span categories. However, previous studies did not focus on the distinction between specialists and generalists. Although we know that specialists that engage in category spanning are penalized, there is a lack of studies describing the consequences for generalists that decide to add additional categories to their portfolio of services. Another factor that has been overlooked in previous studies is the urgency of demand for the product or service. Although economists have found that an urgent new demand is an opportunity for organizations to increase their profits, category spanning in response to such an urgent new demand has been neglected in organization theory. We study these issues using data collected from a sample of 34848 projects run by 2480 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the humanitarian sector. We show that a generalist in category membership that adds additional categories to their portfolio is more successful than specialists who start to span categories. We also show that in the case of an urgent demand, organizations are more successful when spanning categories."
2018,"Category Spanning and the Paradox of Strategic Conventionality in the Italian Opera While literature on categories has recently turned attention to how organizations can mitigate the illegitimacy discount (Zuckerman, 1999) of category spanning, most empirical studies have tested this effect in the context of a market-maker audience. This paper contributes to the scholarly debate by further unpacking the conditions in which a market-taker conservative audience can reward category spanning and the resulting hybrid products. By problematizing the relationship between degrees of categorical contrast and categorical features, we hypothesize that a conservative audience can positively reward organizations that blend the features of two high-contrast categories when the combined entity preserves the core features of the category that reflects conservative audience expectations while hybridizing peripheral attributes. Furthermore, we introduce the paradox of strategic conventionality: while producers strategically increase the conventionality (Durand & Kremp, 2016) of hybrid products to attract attention, external audiences penalize highly conventional hybrids based on assessments of perceived inauthenticity (Carroll & Wheaton, 2009). We develop our context-specific hypotheses in the Italian opera sector based on an original panel data of opera houses programming decisions."
2018,"Under the Magnifying Glass: Expertise and Categorization on the Perception of Atypicality Prior research shows that category-spanning organizations tend to be sanctioned by market audiences for being seen as more atypical than focused organizations. While categorization is a crucial first step is the valuation process, the heterogeneity of audience members categorization is a blind spot in research on market categories. In this paper, we propose to study a) the relationship between category-spannings distance and perceived atypicality, a link that, while assumed, has never been tested, b) the effect of the variation of audience members expertise on how they perceived a category-spanner as atypical and c) how the mode of categorization, either based on goals or based on prototypes, affects such perceived atypicality. We test our hypotheses through an on-line experiment. As expected, we find that category-spannings distance increases perceived atypicality and that this effect is, at the subordinate level of classification, present only for experts. As hypothesized, expertise is significantly and positively associated with perceived atypicality. We obtain partial confirmation for the effect of goal-based categorization on perceived atypicality (but no moderating effect on the relationship between expertise and perceived atypicality). This study has implications for research on categories and evaluation in markets."
2018,"Modern Slavery: The Role of Prototypes in Categorizing Extreme Labor Exploitation Prototypes have long been acknowledged as playing a critical role in the emergence and consolidation of new organizational and market categories. However, the precise forms, characteristics, and effects of prototypes in the categorization process remain unclear. We address this gap by conducting a discourse analysis of different stakeholder contributions to the emergence of the new legal category of modern slavery in the context of the UKs Modern Slavery Act, 2015. Drawing on a political agency view of categorization, our findings reveal that contrary to existing research, the role of prototypes in categorization is heterogeneous. Our analysis identifies four different general forms of prototype, namely typifying, mobilizing, familiarizing, and scoping prototypes, each of which are deployed by different actors to achieve specific goals in the emergence and consolidation of the new category."
2018,"Repertoire, Routinization, and Enacted Complexity in Patterns of Action In this article, we study the effects of action patterns on team performance. We consider two key dimensions: repertoire (the number of recognizable action patterns) and routinization (the extent to which observed actions match the recognized repertoire). Repertoire and routinization have been widely hypothesized to influence performance, but in a contingent way: in simple settings, a small, routinized repertoire is best, but in complex settings, a larger, less routinized repertoire may be preferable. We analyze these relationships using pattern recognition techniques from computer science to obtain objective measures of each construct in two contrasting settings: (1) a crisis management task with high complexity and little prior knowledge; and (2) an invoice management setting with low complexity and much prior knowledge. As expected, we find that repertoire of action patterns and routinization are significant determinants of performance. However, we find that these variables have a significant indirect effect through enacted complexity, a construct that has not been explicitly considered in prior theory."
2018,"How does morality shape the enactment of organizational routines? This paper examines the relation between moral ideals and organizational routines. Prior research suggests that when routine participants strive for moral ideals, ongoing endogenous changes in organizational routines are observed. Yet, if stringent moral ideals, in particular, fairness, is organizationally pursued, how are organizational routines accomplished? We conduct an in-depth qualitative study in the healthcare sector to address this question. Findings suggest that, routine participants strive to eliminate rather than embrace change in the enactment of organizational routines. Yet, routine variability is hard to avoid in open-ended situations leading routine participants to often experience moral risk: uncertainty about whether they are or can be fair in particular circumstances. In very complex situations, they may also experience a sense of tragedy: the superiority of fairness as a moral norm is questioned insofar as it may conflict with other moral ideals. Irrespective of whether they experience moral risk or tragedy through routine enactment, organizational actors dialogically work to suppress any change in core moral beliefs (fairness is regarded as always attainable and preferable). More generally, our research suggests that the pursuit of fairness in organizational routines may reduce opportunities for organizational learning."
2018,"Time in the Making: Toward a Relational Understanding of Time in Routine Performance The present paper examines the role of time in routine performance. Whereas research on routine dynamics explores how routines unfold over time, emerging research on temporal structuring has pointed to the active role of people in shaping event time. Yet little is known how actors build on routines for shaping event time and how event time shapes the dynamics of routines. Drawing on an ethnographic study conducted at a firefighting unit, we elaborate on how routine participants actively make event time by enacting routines and how event time drives the pace of routines. Building on a newly developed method that allows us to plot event time in relation to clock time, we find that actors enact routines for slowing down or speeding up event time. Thereby actors enact temporal structures and shape how they actually experience time. Our study contributes to the understanding of time and routines in three main areas: we introduce the concept of temporal structuring to routines research, we conceptualize how event time is enacted in and through routine performance and we conclude that event time only becomes constituted through the enactment of routine patterns."
2018,"Distal Agency in Orchestrating Time in Organizational Routines In this inductive study, I use the conflicts in the temporality of an organization's routines with the temporality of a new practice to theorize how distal actors outside a routine can orchestrate its performative temporality. Distal actors are those actors who have a stake in how routines are performed but have no direct role or discretion over their performance. I find that these actors use two strategies. First, they used narrative accounts to shape the social cognition of actors embedded within the routine. Second, they mobilized compensatory routines in the broader ecology of routines. I contribute to the literature on organizational routines by drawing attention to their inherent temporality and theorize the process of the influence over these routines. The core contribution of this paper is highlighting how the use of narrative accounts and the mobilization of compensatory routines can allow strategic activists to enhance the capability of a planning- oriented organizational routines to harness fluid and fleeting innovation opportunities."
2018,"The Institutional Ethos of Local Food Communities: The Role of Emotions in Rebuilding Institutions While emotions often serve as a motivation underlying the organization of a local community toward pursuing a common goal, we lack a good understanding of how and why the emotional characteristics of communities become such strong motivators in initiatives to rebuild local institutions. In our research, we build an understanding of this phenomenon through a qualitative investigation of the efforts of a community to rebuild its local food system. Adopting a lens built around the latest advancements in institutional theory integrating emotions into the analysis of institutions, we provide insights into the importance of emotions in the institutional work required to strengthen a re-emerging institution. Through activating and leveraging emotions associated with a local community ethos whose fundamental ideals and emotional characteristics contrast sharply with the ascetic ethos of efficiency of modern bureaucratic institutions, and with the help of traditional events and rituals to support this contrast, individuals are both attracted to and motivated to pursue the common goal of rebuilding the local food system."
2018,"Valuing through Organizing  Assessing Value in Food Collectives This paper examines the relationship between valuing and organising. By adopting a practice perspective and drawing specifically on MacIntyres notion of internal goods, I analyse how household food collectives, as a new practice for exchange of local and organic food, are organized around valuing three kinds of internal goods: good food, good price and good community. I show how the members of the collectives assess these internal goods through what I identified as evaluative modes. The evaluative modes function as organizing mechanisms by engaging people to continuously assess their performance in relation to what counts as good and valuable in their food collective. This study contributes to organizational practice-based studies and has important implications for valuation studies. By developing a model for valuing in a social practice I demonstrate how valuing happens in different practices through evaluative modes that require the participants to assess their performance in relation to the internal goods of their organizing."
2018,"Managing cultural embeddedness in internationalizing craft-based firms: Three cultural strategies Craft firms show exceptionally strong cultural embeddedness in mature home local communities, because of their unique characteristics. Based on an inductive study on Japanese craft firms in the Kyoto region, we found that understanding the international expansion of these firms requires a context- embedded theory of internationalisation. Craft firms apply three internationalisation strategies: cultural endowing, cultural bridging and cultural distilling. Our findings add an element to the debate on the internationalisation of the firm: the context."
2018,"Cluster Shocks and Firm Failure: The Contingent Effects of Community Social Capital This study examines how the social capital associated with communities embedded in a cluster enhances or ameliorates the influence of agglomeration economies or diseconomies on firm failure during non-recession and recession time periods. Using data on all traded clusters in the United States from 1998  2011, the findings reveal that agglomeration benefits erode as clusters grow large, revealing a U-shape relationship between cluster size and the likelihood of firm failure. During non-recession periods, we find that community social capital does not dampen the cluster size  firm failure relationship. However, during economic recessions, when resources are scarcer and competition between firms intensifies, we find that high levels of community social capital shield firms from cluster diseconomies, thereby lowering their failure rates."
2018,"The way to sobriety? A process model of movement-countermovement in Scotch whisky distilling Organizational forms rarely go uncontested, with various societal actor groups seeking to influence forms legitimacy. These actor groups can actually form into social movement coalitions (SMCs) and jointly pursue shared goals. Our knowledge on how these coalitions are formed, and how effective they are remains limited. Less so when these social movement coalitions face countermovement by opposing forces. Our focus is on the Scotch Whisky Distilling industry from the formation of the first temperance society in Scotland in the early 18th century until 1940. During a centuries-long struggle, temperance associations, the Church of Scotland, and Liberal Party politicians challenged distilleries on moral and legal grounds, framing them as sources of societal depravation and erosion of the moral character of the Scots. As a countermovement, whisky industry associations, in coalition with industry- sponsored charities and Conservative Party politicians, highlighted distilleries important economic role and their symbolic value as emblems of Scottish culture. Using the case, we craft a historically sensitive process model of movement-countermovement formation and effectiveness."
2018,"Understanding CEO Activism: Actions and Implications This paper complements the few existing studies on the emerging phenomenon of CEO activism by examining the phenomenon from the social movement and stakeholder perspectives. I outline a typology of the tactics used by CEOs as social activists, highlighting their similarities and differences with the traditional movement actor tactics and discussing the tactics fit with the traditional role expectations placed on CEO behavior. I argue that with the broad understanding of stakeholders as being anyone who can affect or be affected by the organization, CEO activism can be seen as bringing social movement theory and stakeholder theory together. I demonstrate, accordingly, how the tactics used by CEOs can have consequences for both the social movement actors and the firms stakeholder groups. I further show how these stakeholders might respond to CEO activism and how these responses could, in turn, have consequences for the activist CEOs firms."
2018,"Fields of Contention: Challengers, Incumbents, and the Use of Boss-napping in Bengal We study how challengers and incumbents seeking to use a disruptive tactic compete in strategic action fields (SAFs). We suggest that the challenger and incumbent face trade-off between getting attention versus alienating supporters. We analyze the use of a gherao  a form of taking the boss hostage  by the Congress Party (the challenger) and the Communist Party (the incumbent) in individual districts in the state of Bengal, India. Our results show that challengers use the gherao in swing districts where they are closely matched with the incumbents, are less likely to gherao when there is a legacy of amicable conflict resolution in a district and more likely to gherao in the aftermath of a large religious festival. Incumbents respond not to the recency of a challengers actions, but instead, to the frequency of a challenger's actions. Both challengers and incumbents gherao private firms in districts, and then escalate contention into the public field by targeting state-owned enterprises. Taken together, these results inject both strategy and action into the construct of SAFs."
2018,"The Determinants of Enacting Institutional Logics on the Ground: A Set-theoretic Approach This paper empirically examines causal relationships between the degree of identification of individual organisational members with competing institutional logics, and the type of response that they activate when these logics contradict each other. By applying a combination of induction and Fuzzy-set theoretic Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) to a dataset collected from a low- hybridity setting, where the competing logics are not of equal strength, I analyse how the individuals degree of identification with one dominant (professional) and two peripheral (corporate and market) logics, impact their type of response. This analysis identifies that, in hybrid organisations, to increase the likelihood of complying with the values prescribed by the dominant logic, identification with that logic is necessary, as expected; but, not sufficient. I find the most plausible configuration of causal conditions (a combination of identification with the dominant and the peripheral logics) that produces dominant-logic- congruent behaviours, and discuss about future avenues for research in this area. By studying how professional actors enact institutional logics at the intra- organisational level and relating it to their individual degrees of embeddedness in each logic, this research contributes to the emerging literature on inhabited institutions, institutional complexity and hybrid organisations."
2018,"A Socio-Cognitive Model of Logic Formation in Complex Institutional Fields This paper explores the micro-processes through which disparate actors within a highly complex institutional field drive logic formation. Our findings are drawn from a year-long field case study documenting the formation of the PACT for Social Transformation, a meta- organizational coalition of geographically dispersed youth organizations in the emerging global HIV/AIDS field brought together by the United Nations. By conducting a dual-phased, mixed methods study of the micro-level interactions that occurred between disparate PACT members during a unique episode of field-configuration, we inductively derive and deductively validate three socio-cognitive trigger and sensemaking mechanism pairings to advance a processual model of logic formation in complex fields. Our findings show how actors negotiate their conflicts and navigate institutional complexity through a combination of reflective-retrospective, reflexive-situated, and abstractive-distributive patterns of sensemaking that induce different cycles of institutional boundary work."
2018,"The generative properties of institutional logics as belief systems and cultural repertoires We theorize the intrinsic generative potential of field-level institutional logics and examine the contextual conditions that shape it. We first unpack institutional logics into two core aspects: (1) repertoires of cultural elements associated with a domain and (2) a shared belief system connecting and giving meaning to cultural elements. We explain why these two aspects provide different explanations for reproduction and change in field-level logics, and how they induce changes in one other. Building on the dual perspective, we outline four ways in which institutional logics are instantiated in organizations and develop propositions linking them to the genesis of new cultural elements in the field-level logic."
2018,"Institutional Logics and Value Capture in Emerging Categories: A Neo- Configurational Perspective Why do some organizations in emerging categories capture more value than others? In emerging categories, organizations need to conform to multi-level institutional logics through sense-giving practices to overcome the lack of category legitimacy. While research on categories and institutional logics has fundamentally advanced our understanding of how isolated practices or institutional factors influence organizational performance, there is a dearth of empirical studies that explores these dimensions holistically. Building on a neo-configurational perspective, we aim to integrate these perspectives to explore why and how configurations of sense-giving practices and institutional factors lead to superior value capture. Our study presents a comprehensive mixed methods study of coworking spaces, a rapidly emerging organizational category. Based on 28 case studies and 71 interviews across 12 countries, we first develop a framework of the institutional logics and sense-giving practices of coworking spaces. Building on a proprietary database of 870 coworking spaces in the United States, China, India, and Germany, we then use fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to explore the configurations of these elements that cause coworking spaces to capture superior value. Our configurational solutions show provide highly contextualized insights into how new ventures can use narratives and material sense-giving practices to navigate expectations within their regional and category logics."
2018,"Robust Cooperation in the Presence of Rankings Creating systems of cooperation in the face of strong self-interest is a subject of longstanding inquiry in the social sciences. Much of this work has focused on understanding the antecedents and outcomes associated with cooperation, assuming that the inertial properties of a system will continue to perpetuate cooperation over time. This paper shifts the focus toward examining how cooperation is maintained in the face of potentially disruptive forces. To advance theory, research, and practice on how to maintain cooperation over time, we examine how systems of cooperation interact with, withstand, or succumb to a potentially disruptive force that is commonplace in organizational contexts: rankings. Using a longitudinal, no-deception, between-groups experimental design, we assess how systems of cooperation respond to the introduction of performance rankings. Examining data from more than 11,000 rounds of decision-making from 592 participants clustered in 74 teams, we find that cooperation plummets when performance rank information is introduced. However, the addition of reputation information individuals histories of prosocial contributionsenables a system of cooperation to recover from the disruptive effects of performance rankings. Reputation serves as a source of system robustness that restores cooperation, enabling a system of cooperation to withstand forces that would otherwise destroy it. Our study contributes to theories of cooperation, performance feedback, and macro-level prosocial behavior."
2018,"Organizing Secrecy in Inter-Firm Cooperation Secrecy is shaping organizations and inter-organizational relations, but the organization science has a limited empirical knowledge on secrecy as a process and how companies use it in practice. Inter-firm cooperation brings additional challenges, where secrecy is both necessary for partners to remain independent and constrained by the needs of co-working relationships. This paper presents the case study of a large biotechnology firm and its partners, and analyses how the cooperating companies use and organize their secretive activities. I identify the meaning of those activities to the process participants, and develop a model of relational secrecy practices embedded in external and internal contexts."
2018,"The Enabling Roles of Bureaucracy in Cross-Expertise Collaboration Based on a 15-month ethnographic study of the engineering division of an aeronautical company, I explore the role of bureaucracy in cross-expertise collaboration. I bring together an attention to situated work practices with a focus on formal elements and I find that, contrary to expectations, bureaucracy has an enabling impact on collaborative processes. More specifically, my fieldwork shows that the typical elements of a bureaucratic work organization foster clarity, fairness, integration and streamlined relations in the interdependent work of a multitude of experts involved in the product development of the company. These positive outcomes, however, depend on three conditions under which bureaucracy operates in this context. Namely, the familiarity of employees with bureaucratic structures, their buy-in, and the flexibility they have when dealing with them. I propose that these findings contribute to organizational scholarship in at least three ways. First, unlike what is assumed, this study shows that bureaucracy supports collaboration and helps to solve key challenges associated with work across expertise domains. Second, it enriches our understanding of the interplay between formal and informal elements in cross-expertise work. Third, it refines our ideas about the role of bureaucracy in lateral relations and the conditions underpinning its enabling value."
2018,"Finding a Better Match for Creative Collaboration: A Dyad Level Analysis of Academic Co-Authorship Why are some co-authorship interactions more successful than others to create novel research outcomes? We endeavor to investigate this research question by exploring how dyadic differences of collaboration characteristics affect collaborative outcomes (creative performance). While prior studies on creativity and innovation have provided ample evidence for understanding the individual or team-level determinants of successful collaboration, less attention has been paid to studying creative collaboration at the dyad level. We analyzed 235 joint academic research papers that were published in the twelve management journals during 1998-2007. Our findings indicate that at the dyad-level, knowledge diversity, knowledge overlap, the interaction between knowledge diversity and knowledge overlap, and previous collaboration experience strongly impact creative performance. We also find that dyadic differences in past creative performance is positively associated with creative performance."
2018,"How to undo things with words? On counter-performative effects in the financial industry This article discusses the notion of counter-performativity as defined by MacKenzie and Spears (2014), drawing on an analysis of how performative processes unfold in the financial industry. To make our point, we investigate the implementation of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), a regulatory package aimed at creating a level-playing field among European member States. Using an ethnographic study conducted in an investment firm between 2006 and 2009, we show a case where the implementation of the pure model of perfect competition is counter-performed, that is, generates a market context that is significantly different from what the economic model seeks to achieve. We make sense of our empirical material by drawing on the theoretical perspectives on performativity developed by Muniesa (2014). Specifically, in examining this performative process, we look at trials of explicitness resulting in new problems about what exactly is to be made explicit and how such explicitation happens. Our paper contributes to increasing our knowledge on performative processes by highlighting the crucial role played by interactions among actors in charge of translating ideas into material devices. At the same time, we provide an illustration of how counter-performative effects are triggered in these processes."
2018,"Reputational Entrepreneurship and the Valuation of Scientic Achievement Using citations as a measure of valuation and death as an exogenous shock that affects efforts to sell scientific work but not the quality of the work itself, we estimate the importance of reputational entrepreneurship on the valuation of life scientists' research. Insofar as reputational entrepreneurship is impactful, it is unclear whether the most effective reputational entrepreneurs are those selling their own work (salesman) or those promoting the work of others (the sales force). While the salesman has more incentive to promote her work, the sales force is likely to be seen as more credible. We find that by commemorating the death of a scientist, the sales force boosts the field's valuation of the deceased's work relative to what the salesman could have done had she remained alive. This suggests that while science seeks to divorce the researcher's identity from their work, scientists' identities nonetheless play an important role in determining scientific valuations."
2018,"Performative Valorization: The Case of the Louvre Museum Despite the resources invested by luxury goods companies, supermarkets, or museums to change the value attached to the collection of things they sell or exhibit, we know surprisingly little about organizational practices of valorization and their performative effects. Prior Despite the resources invested by luxury goods companies, supermarkets, or museums to change the value attached to the collection of things they sell or exhibit, we know surprisingly little about organizational practices of valorization and their performative effects. Prior research has focused on evaluation practices (practices that assess value) rather than valorization practices (practices that grant value). In this paper, we rely on insights from valuation and performativity studies to shift the empirical focus from evaluation to valorization practices, and theorize the performative effects of such practices. Using the Louvre-Lens museum  a branch of the Louvre museum located in the city of Lens, France  as our empirical context, we induced four performative practices of valorization  inscribing, scripting, structuring and designing  by which the members of the Louvre-Lens team granted a new value inspired by an art theory called Global Art History to the Louvres collection of artwork. We first show how these valorization practices, which are constituted of both meaning (here: Global Art History) and materialities, reshaped the boundaries around the collection of artworks, the building, the organizational structure of the museum, and visitors, by creating theory-informed agential cuts. We then show how, together, these practices of valorization had performative effects, in the sense that they enabled the Louvre-Lens visitors to experience the Global Art History meaning of the collection of artworks, hence performing (or actualizing) a given theory of art. In so doing, our paper contributes to both valuation studies and organizational studies of performativity."
2018,"Another One Bites the Dust: Oppositional Identity and Category Convergence in the Beer Industry An extensive body of research explores how new market categories emerge, however, much less is known about how market categories evolve over time. To advance our understanding of category dynamics, this inductive field study of the U.S. beer industry examines convergence between oppositional and incumbent market categories. Our findings reveal that incumbents acquisitions of oppositional category members raised identity tensions, challenging the founding ideology and the distinctiveness of the oppositional market category. Our process model further proposes two theoretical mechanismsa forced perspective and identity slippagethat lead two opposing categories toward convergence."
2018,"How Stigmatized Categories Emerge: The Abortion Clinic in the United States after Roe v. Wade A growing area of interest within the literature on categorization concerns stigmatized categories, i.e. groups of organizations that are collectively perceived as engaging in controversial practices. Because such practices draw high levels of societal disapproval, which in turn makes the category unattractive to potential new entrants, the processes through which stigmatized categories of organizations form represent a key empirical puzzle. In this paper, we examine stigmatized category formation through an in-depth historical case study of the emergence of free- standing abortion clinics in the United States. Through our historical analysis, we identify three mechanisms that contributed to the establishment and population of this stigmatized category: a) the founding of de novo, specialist organizations, by pro-choice advocates; b) the entry by de alio organizations championing allied causes; and c) the exit of generalist organizations, or hospitals, from abortion provision. Furthermore, we find that the above dynamics were catalyzed by social movement action both in support of and in opposition to the stigmatized practice, which exacerbated category contrast and consolidated the role of free-standing clinics as the main providers of abortion services in the U.S. We conclude by discussing the relevance of our findings for the literatures on stigma, categories, and social movements."
2018,"Role Regeneration as a Pathway to Powerless Category Persistence. We explore how a category comprised of relatively powerless members and lacking centralized leadership persisted throughout decades of unprecedented disruptions. Drawing on interview and archival data we capture the responses of U.S.-based privately-owned travel agencies to industry deregulation, the emergence of online competition, the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the cessation of airline ticket commissions. We find that during this time, category members individually altered their reliance on specific roles, in response to the needs of their immediate stakeholders and available technologies. Some historic roles were resurrected by agents who leveraged their longevity in the category, while others were adapted to the contemporary context. We find three mechanisms  leveraging longevity, tapping networks, and technology investing  that drove the collective regeneration of the categorys roles, enabling its persistence. We contribute to theory by demonstrating how seemingly powerless actors shape category dynamics through unwitting agency, complementing an emphasis on strategic action. Through demonstrating how roles influence categorization, we also contribute to theory on the benefits to category ambiguity, and the role of social context in shaping categories."
2018,"Inter- professional categorization in accounting regulation We examine the SECs Modernization of Oil and Gas Reserves project to highlight the role of categories and professional interactions in accounting regulation. Drawing from analysis of regulatory documents and interviews with key actors, we find that accounting and engineering professionals are engaged in mutually reinforcing category (re-) construction. Previous research has emphasized professional competition and neglected the important role of ambiguity, in our case associated with the characteristics of knowledge objects and technologies themselves. We view corporate financial reporting as networked and distributed, where intersecting complementary professional knowledge systems occupy the same reporting and regulatory space. In oil and gas reporting, the practices of identification, classification and estimation are fraught with uncertainty of the object. We find that, as a way to stabilize uncertainty, professionals collaborate on embedding ambiguity within the revised regulations, maintaining the categories, practices and measurement technologies, and acceptable ways of knowing the products."
2018,"Cultural Transmission & Variation in Organizational Populations: A Formal Model What explains the diversity of firm cultures in organizational populations? While research on culture has made significant strides in understanding intra- organizational cultural processes, it has largely taken for granted the existence of variation in organizational culture across firms. In this paper, I develop a formal model to understand cultural variation in populations as a function of cultural transmission both within and between firms. Bridging cultural processes like employee recruitment, socialization, and turnover with labor market mechanisms, the model conceptualizes individual employees as 'cultural carriers' that move between firms. Based on agent-based simulations of this model, I find that population-level dynamics have significant and surprising consequences, often disrupting the intentions of firm-level practices. For example, within-industry employee mobility may suppress overall cultural variation. As a result, more deliberate organizational practices like culturally selective hiring and lower turnover may actually result in greater cultural diversity, rather than homogeneity, within firms. Importantly, the model validates the significance of and provides a basis for the study of inter- organizational cultural processes."
2018,"International Replication of Cultural Products: A Configurational Approach The research of replication as strategy has uncovered contingencies governing the replication of routines and business models, however, less attention has been paid to the replication of products that are symbolic rather than utilitarian in nature, or cultural products. This paper aims to fill this gap in academic research by drawing from literature on strategy in cultural industries and analyzing international replication of cultural products. Using a sample of television formats and their adaptations in two different countries, I use fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis to find out what configurations of antecedents are consistently associated with successful and unsuccessful replicas. The configurational approach uncovers that replication of cultural products is a balancing act. Results indicate that some adaptation, particularly in categorizing a cultural product as belonging to a certain genre, is crucial. However, adaptation efforts need to be consistent, and if value claims of the product are changed without adapting the genre positioning, the replica runs the risk of failure."
2018,"Bridging Divides: Translating Sustainable Livelihoods to Indonesia through Empowerment Work This study delivers insights into how heterogeneous promoters and adopters of an idea can overcome asymmetries regarding their life- worlds and positions of power to achieve idea translation. Based on the case of the translation of the concept of sustainable livelihoods to Indonesia, which involved rural farmers and an international conservation NGO, we argue that translation involving heterogeneous actors requires multiple dimensions of institutional empowerment work jointly executed through promoters, adopters and boundary-spanning intermediaries. First, political empowerment work refers to building structures for the participation of the low- power stakeholders during translation, enabling adopters to actively contribute their perspectives. Second, social empowerment work relates to establishing relationships between promoters and adopters that support the process of translation, through addressing a lack of interpersonal trust and adopters identification with an idea. We contribute through developing a processual view of translation, which complicates the largely one-directional notion of translation prevalent in the literature. Furthermore, we present types of institutional work required to establish cooperation among heterogeneous actors, a dimension of work that has so far been understudied, and deliver insights into tackling grand challenges involving outsider-driven institutional change."
2018,"Valence in Organizational Culture: Cultural Alignment, Employee Satisfaction, and Market Performan Prior research has emphasized the importance of a strong culture for firm performance, defining cultural strength on the basis of employee agreement about the beliefs, norms and values that are prized by a firm. We refine the established notion of strong culture by proposing that strong cultures encompass two possibilities: (i) having a high level of alignment in what employees describe as positive aspects of culture and (ii) having a high level of alignment in what employees describe as negative aspects of culture. We argue that these two types of cultural strength differently impact how employees evaluate their organizations and how the market anticipates the future performance of these organizations. We adopt a language-based model to measure cultural alignment among employees using over 100,000 unique employee reviews of 816 publicly traded firms across different industries on the Glassdoor website, an online career intelligence platform. Consistent with our theoretical arguments, we find that greater agreement on what employees consider as positive aspects of culture is positively associated with employee satisfaction and market performance. We also find that a higher level of agreement on what employees deem negative aspects of culture portends devaluation of an organization by its employees and by the stock market. Additionally, we find that agreement on negative cultural attributes, compared to agreement on positive cultural attributes, has a greater impact on employees' and the market's evaluation of organizations. We offer insights for managerial practice by suggesting that focusing on eliminating negative aspects of culture that employees agree on will have a greater payoff than focusing on boosting agreement about positive aspects. Contributions to the organizational culture literature are discussed."
2018,"Cultural Entrepreneurship: Towards a Theory of Meaning Cultivation Culture is critical for organizational and entrepreneurial outcomes, and the notion of cultural entrepreneurship is increasingly gaining currency for shedding light on the ways actors rally support for new ideas or products, or break new ground at the collective level of an industry or a market category. Despite the broad potential of cultural entrepreneurship, however, current understandings undertheorize the role that culture plays in the process, remain confined to the study of new venture legitimation and resource acquisition, or narrowly emphasize storytelling over other cultural mechanisms. Addressing these shortcomings, this paper builds an overarching framework of cultural entrepreneurship. First, we squarely put culture in cultural entrepreneurship and recast the notion as a process of meaning cultivation. We then take cultural entrepreneurship beyond entrepreneurship by delineating its conceptual boundaries in a way that is not empirically grounded but theoretically driven. Finally, beside storytelling, we advocate for a richer understanding of the cultural vehicles by which new meanings are cultivated. In sum, our central contribution is to broaden our understanding of what cultural entrepreneurship is, where it occurs, and by which means."
2018,"De-centring the field: Using post-colonial theory to infuse power into institutional theory Institutional theory has often been criticized for not taking the question of power seriously in its analyses. In this paper, drawing on John Mohrs critique of the spatial metaphor of the institutional field that dominates institutional theory, we argue that one of the key problems in addressing power are the analytical conventions that take the field as a flat terrain of networked relations. We use post- colonial and feminist theory as a lens on the field metaphor used in institutional theory, to further problematize how the binary of the centre and periphery in the field ignores relationships of power that in effect are tacit in this division. This is especially evident in the point of departure used to delineate the field where the point of view of the central or more powerful actors is paramount in what gets constituted as a field. In our discussion, we propose four reasons for why it is essential to shift the analytical standpoint to one that of the peripheral actors within a field in order to reinvigorate and enable a better discussion of power within institutional theory."
2018,"Do institutions still matter? A replication of zuckers (1977) classic experiment. Institutional theory has become one of the dominant approaches to understanding organizations. Although, many institutionalists started to address the role of agency most scholars, however, seem to agree on the idea that institutions guide individual actions. Some scholars have suggested the need to return to some of the core theoretical statements and proposed relationships in institutional theory. In this paper we take up this challenge. In doing so, we replicate Zuckers (1977) classic experiment one of the seminal papers on which much of institutional theory (or at least an important strand of institutional theory) was build. However, we did not find any support for the three hypotheses originally developed by Zucker. To a large extent Zuckers (1977) findings are not replicable in our context. This may not come as a complete surprise given that our study was conducted 40 years after the original study, and in a different context. Yet, the results from our control group are strikingly similar compared to the original study."
2018,"From Micro-Level Research to Microfoundations of Institutions: Review, Synthesis, and Challenges Institutional theorists have recently called for the development of the microfoundations of institutional theory. This call coincides with noteworthy progress in research that has used institutional theory to explore micro-level phenomena. It is surprising though that calls for building microfoundations largely operate outside of the body of literature that has captured dynamics on the micro level. That is calls for building microfoundations highlight needs to build further links between institutional theory with other theories known from sociology and organization theory as opposed to effectively capitalizing on the existing research that has attended to micro-level phenomena. Thus, we complement this work by a systematic review of micro level research within institutional theory to outline how this could be used to build microfoundations of institutions. This is important because continuously adding links with other theories is likely to increase surplus value of the idea of microfoundations."
2018,"Multilevel Structure of Interorganizational Networks: Theoretical Mechanisms and Empirical Tests A distinctive feature of formal organizations as social actors is their changeable internal structure. Yet, studies of interorganizational networks typically take internal organizational structure as given, thus assuming that internal organizational change does not affect external relations with partners. This assumption is problematic because network mechanisms potentially affecting partner selection decisions, such as homophily, transitivity or reciprocity, depend delicately on the internal resources controlled by partners. Surprisingly, we know little about how these basic network mechanisms operate when the internal structure of organizational nodes changes. To bridge this gap, we present a multilevel network framework linking change in interorganizational networks to change in internal organizational structure. Change occurring at the former (interorganziational) level involves change in the portfolio of network ties to external partners  and hence change in the set of extramural resources that organizations may access through partners. Change occurring in the latter (intraorganizational) level involves change in the portfolio of internal activities that organizations hold  and hence change in the pool of internal knowledge, competences and experiences that organizations control. We propose models that specify how processes of change across these two levels of action are connected. We test the empirical value of these models on data that we have collected on a community of hospital organizations connected by patient referral relations. We focus on the interaction between process or change in external network partners and internal activities. We outline the general implications of the study for future research on the evolutionary dynamics of interorganizational networks."
2018,"Dynamic Process Model of Brokerage for Systemic Social Impact Achieving systemic impact to address complex societal problems calls for structural shifts in underlying socioeconomic arrangements and mobilizing stakeholders from different sectors. Motivated by the question of how disconnected and isolated actors connect together to collectively contribute to transformation in an ecosystem, through a qualitative historical analysis of the case of the largest food security organization in Canada, we examine the role of brokerage organizations toward systemic social impact. Using a process lens, we provide evidence for the evolution of an iungens brokerage organization and illustrate how brokerage organizations dynamically and progressively switch between brokerage rolesmediation and catalysis in order to ensure transfer of capital across the actors while building connections and enriching them for partnerships. Our results bring back mediation mechanisms as crucial to structural solutions in the contexts where already existing arrangements are not sufficient for a collective outcome. We also find that brokers can trigger long-term systemic effects by creating and showcasing a model of brokerage in the system that is replicable by other actors in their absence."
2018,"The Network Structure of Bad Jobs: How Market Constraint Undermines Job Quality Power and dependence in economic exchange shape companies strategy. When firms or industries are heavily dependent on concentrated and powerful upstream suppliers or downstream buyers, this can constrain their opportunities to gain competitive advantage and capture economic rents. At the extreme, heavy dependence on powerful suppliers or buyers can result in constrained alternatives and limited opportunities. We argue that these dynamics affect job quality. Drawing on ideas from social network analysis and resource-dependency theory, this paper offers a structural account of industry earnings and job quality differences based on inter-industry exchange patterns. In particular, we build on Burts seminal approach to analyzing structural autonomy and constraint in economic exchange using industry input- output tables. We calculate market constraint measures for recent years in the U.S. and link these with CPS data on individual wages and job quality. Analyses reveal that workers in more constrained industries, by virtue of their exchange dependence on highly concentrated industries, face a wage penalty, are more likely to experience non-standard employment, and have less access to employer-provided healthcare and retirement pensions. Our theory and results suggest that decentralized modes of economic governance have negatively affected workers."
2018,"The (State-Private) Ties that Bind: Status, Occupations, and Economic Development in India Governments often undertake economic development initiatives to facilitate growth. In studying such projects and policies, sociologists have identified productive collaborations between state officials and private sector representatives as a key component of successful initiatives. Scholars argue that strong state-private ties allow for greater exchange of technical expertise and are mutually beneficial. In this study, we present a case that challenges the familiar perspective that strong state-private ties are associated with successful initiatives. We examine how officials in the Indian government collaborated with private sector representatives to design and implement an industrial crafts park that ultimately failed to achieve its economic goals. Using ethnographic observations, interviews, and supplemental survey data, we show that status biases in tie formation and occupational heterogeneity in the private sector make state officials vulnerable to designing programs that are misaligned with private sector needs, even when they work closely with private sector representatives. This study reveals how micro-level interaction patterns aggregate to influence large-scale development outcomes. More broadly, it highlights an important but undertheorized pathway by which bureaucrats may inadvertently cement social stratification through the very projects that aim to alleviate economic inequality."
2018,"Inadvertent Tacit Knowledge Transfer Through Work Routines In Innovation Teams. This qualitative inductive study of five high-end cutting-edge culinary R&D; teams in the US and Europe extends existing knowledge transfer research by showing how tacit knowledge can be transferred inadvertently in the course of everyday organizational routines. Specifically, I find that the iterative prototype-oriented product development routines commonly used to manage innovation and new product development enable inadvertent tacit knowledge transfer through the receipt, integration, and testing of rich information contained in prototype-focused feedback. I identify three distinct feedback practices that enrich the information content of feedback: Group (vs individual) feedback sessions, use of concrete exemplars (vs abstract concepts) in feedback, and outcome-focused (vs process- focused) feedback. Based on these findings, I develop a process theory of individual-level tacit knowledge acquisition through test-feedback-update cycles in the context of routine work."
2018,"Managing the Trade-Off Between Delegation and Task Interdependence in Creative Teams In this study we analyze the interactive effects of delegation of decision rights (task autonomy) and team task interdependence on creative team performance. Creative teams are characterized by a high requirement for both autonomy and task interdependence, suggesting that ideally creative teamwork should be designed in a way that both are maximized. However, we expect that giving team members higher autonomy will in fact undermine the positive effect of more task interdependence on team creativity and vice versa. Most importantly, while the trade-off between autonomy and team task interdependence is inherent in the nature of creative work, we argue that some creative teams are better able to deal with this trade-off than others, depending on the presence of selection, training and cultural control as mechanisms for supporting successful team self-control. Such clan control enables teams to efficiently self-manage and self-regulate team activities in order to reconcile high task interdependence and high task autonomy (team self-control). We test our hypotheses using survey data collected from 101 teams and 372 individuals in 53 marketing agencies, and find evidence that is consistent with our predictions."
2018,"The Role Differentiation Problem in Reassembled Innovation Teams Do teams reassembled with same members (i.e., reassembled teams) generate greater innovation outcomes? Previous research on this question has found mixed results, which we consider to be the outcome of a limited number of articulations of the processes by which reassembly influences innovation outcomes. In this study, we posit a disadvantage of reassembled innovation teams that results from the role differentiation problem: in reassembled teams each members role becomes more clearly differentiated, which results in limiting the within-team interactions that are critical for generating new ideas. We also argue that some structural conditions alleviate or deteriorate the role differentiation problem, suggesting that carefully designed reassembled teams can avoid this problem. Our analysis of the patent application data of a major Japanese technology firm offers considerable support to our argument. The results capture the occurrence of Silo Effects in reassembled teams, and confirm that fragmentation, specialization, and the division of labor can sometimes cause damage and impair the creation of new knowledge."
2018,"Utilitarian Partnering for Innovation: The Role of High-powered Incentives The dominant argument in the literature on incentives for innovation is that high- powered incentives (e.g., pay-for-performance) have detrimental effects on innovation outcomes. We reassess this argument by focusing on how firms adoption of high-powered incentives promote firm innovators adaptive behavior and, in particular, engender their changes in partnering with others in forming innovation teams. We propose the idea of utilitarian partnering, or partnering with others in team formations to enhance the instrumental value of others knowledge. We predict that when a firm adopts high-powered incentives, firm innovators have fewer individual projects, form teams with more members, avoid partnering with repeated partners and partners with greater knowledge overlap, and prefer partnering with high-performing others. Such newly generated partnering patterns enable firm innovators non-local search in processes of knowledge recombination and result in greater innovation outcomes. We use the patent application data of a Japanese electronics manufacturer and conduct difference-in-difference analyses to assess the effects of the firms adoption of high-powered incentives. We find support for our arguments about firm innovators utilitarian partnering under high- powered incentives."
2018,"How Categories Shape the Value of Innovations This study challenges the idea that categories have little relevance for understanding how innovations are valued. Categories scholars have had difficulty accounting for such contexts because valuation is often based on forward influence rather than hierarchical rankings and consumption decisions. In comparison, innovation studies have focused on the link between an innovations attributes and its value, while largely overlooking the effects of broader socio-cognitive structures such as categories. We address this gap by combining insights about categories and recombinant search to predict when an innovation is likely to be noticed and built upon by others within the same versus different categories. We then consider how a categorys position within a classification system affects the likelihood of the innovations therein being noticed in cross-category search, and how this relates to overall influence. We test our predictions with a quasi-experiment that uses data from 8,823 patent families to compare how the influence of the exact same innovation varies based on its categorization in different patent systems. This approach isolates the role of categories in valuation and shows that considerable variance is explained by an innovations position within a given category and by that categorys position relative to others in a classification system."
2018,"The Sound of Finance: The Impact of Categorization and Linguistic Congruence on IPO Underpricing While categorical ambiguity impacts negatively firm value in some research, others estimate that congruence with evaluators theory of value matters more than prima facie categorical ambiguity. This paper addresses these theoretical and empirical puzzles in a novel fashion, using linguistic patterns of 2930 firms going public and all institutional investors in the US from 1996 to 2015. In isolation, we find as expected that (1) as the linguistic information contained in IPO prospectus is categorically ambiguous, the IPOs stock return on the first day of trading (underpricing) is lower; and (2) the linguistic congruence of an IPO across institutional investors (average consensus across theories of value and variation in consensus) increases underpricing. When combined, the direct effect of categorical ambiguity dissipates, suggesting the prevalence of the theory of value arguments over categorization based on prototypes. We discuss the theoretical implications of these findings for research on market categories, firm valuation, and language using big data."
2018,"Toward a Strategic Perspective on Categorization Existing research believes that the categorization process is exogenous, and penalties arise when organizations attempt to straddle categories. However, category spanners are widely seen in modern society, implying that unidentified mechanisms may trigger organizations to cross category boundaries. I hence argue that the categorization process is endogenous to organizations to some extent, and internal organizational agents play an important role in shaping the category domain the focal organization claims in. Using a large dataset from online film databases, I study the categorization of feature films in North America. I find that the team- and personal- level attributes of a film crew, including the producer, director, and casts, deeply affect the genre labels the focal film will receive from audiences. In addition, the extent to which the film crew interferes in the categorization process ultimately affects the box office gross of the focal film. My research advances category research by framing categorization as a producer-centric, rather than an audience-centric, process, and recognizing the role of organizational agents in product categorization."
2018,"Blurred Lines: Market Democratization and Crossover Production in the US Commercial Music Industry New technologies have eroded the boundaries between professionals and lay actors and democratized marketplaces by empowering the latter. How does the democratization of a market influence producers' boundary spanning decisions? Compared to lay actors, professionals specialized in the market may be more knowledgeable about its boundaries and benefit more from a clearly defined market. As the power shifts from professionals to laypeople, producers may be more likely to span market boundaries in hope of reaching a larger audience. The general trend of boundary spanning may also open up niches for authentic products in the core of the market. As a result, some producers may choose not to span boundaries in order to appeal to audiences who value authenticity. I exploit a Billboard chart policy shock that shifted the power from genre radio stations to casual listeners in some music markets. Using a measure of crossover based on acoustic features of the song recordings, I find that average producers increasingly borrow elements from other musical genres after democratization. Meanwhile, the democratized market as a whole becomes less distinctive from others. Moreover, the crossover effect is driven by established firms and generalist organizations. This study offers important and nuanced implications for product variety, market boundaries and the rise of lay actors in the market."
2018,"Old at Heart, Young at the Periphery: An Age-Dependence Approach to Resource Partitioning This study examines how the age of categories and organizations within an industry affects the likelihood of de novo entry. Whereas previous literature on age dependence focused on the effects of aging for individual organizations, we analyze how aging processes drive the evolution of markets. We offer an age-related explanation for the mechanism of resource partitioning, i.e., the relative increase in the number of new entrants in a markets periphery as a result of increasing concentration among central incumbents. We theorize that, as the incumbents within a category grow older, their capacity to undertake structural changes diminishes: coupled with evolving audience preferences, this generates a gap between what the incumbents are capable to offer and what the audience demands, hence creating opportunities for new entrants to step into the market. We also conjecture that such entry opportunities are more likely in younger categories, where the audiences preferences change more rapidly. We test our arguments through a longitudinal study of market segments in the recording industry."
2018,"Novelty and Market Success: Evidence from the Movie Industry Does novelty mean commercial success? We examine this question in the context of movie industry where creativity is assumed to be the key to success. The paper uses the movie data from 1911 to 2016 to examine the impact of novelty in movie plot on the box office performance. We hope to understand if novelty in movie plot leads to better commercial success. We find that there is an inverted-U shape relationship between the novelty of a movie plot, and the box office earnings. This implies that the positive effects of the novelty of a movie plot has on the commercial success changes into a negative, after the optimal level. This result should shed new light on our understanding how or if novelty leads to commercial success."
2018,"Social Mechanisms of Local Knowledge Spillover in the Geography of Innovation We connect the insight that social environments are conducive to individual creativity with the observation that creative persons are attracted to regions in which they can live out their creativity, and in doing so, indirectly contribute to the social environments and creative potential of those regions. We capture the resultant dynamics in a network theory of localized knowledge spillovers. We test this theory using two independently curated, historical datasets. The first consists of the geocoded places and years of the births and deaths of 142,902 creative persons of the secular world who lived in Europe between 1000 and 1900 A.D. The second dataset consists of geocoded places and founding years of 4,220 monasteries of the largest 81 Roman-Catholic Orders in Europe in that period. Between 1000 and 1900 A.D., monastery foundings were entrepreneurial acts, that is, local organizational innovations that require a high degree of creativity and problem-solving. As monastery foundings clearly fall outside the domain of the investigated creative persons, regional variation in monastery founding rates allow us to examine knowledge spillovers resulting from the agglomeration of creative persons in particular regions and at particular times. We extend the proposed network theory of knowledge spillovers to a life-cycle explanation for the rise and decline of regional clusters over time."
2018,"Is there a Gender Gap in the Novelty of Creative Products? Despite the large numbers of women trained and employed in creative fields, perceptions of creative achievement in the fields of art, music, and literature remain biased by gender. Most recent efforts to understand this puzzle focus on demand- side explanations: the extent to which audiences assign less value to creative products made by women. In contrast, this paper identifies the extent to which there is a gender gap in the novelty of creative products produced by male and female artists. Using an exhaustive dataset describing nearly 500,000 songs written and released between 1955 and 2000, we (1) construct a measure of musical novelty and (2) test whether there are any systematic differences in creative output by gender. We then (3) analyze some of the structural and cultural conditions that co-vary with these differences, in an effort to identify the origins of potential inequality. Results suggest that, although there is not a significant difference in the overall novelty of songs produced by men versus women, certain conditions lead to a creativity advantage for each gender. Songs created by the most popular female artists tend to be more novel than those created by their male counterparts, while songs in the right tail of the novelty distribution are more likely to be created by men."
2018,"Scaling deep or scaling up?How relational mechanisms affect the scaling of social innovation While literature on social entrepreneurship has recently turned attention to how social enterprises manage the relational dynamics of social innovation, most empirical studies have focused on the formation of partnerships and alliances as a driver of the development of social innovation. This paper contributes to the scholarly debate by further unpacking the relational mechanisms required to ensure the partnership success in scaling social innovation. By problematizing the relationship between relational mechanisms and the achievement of different scalability objectives, we hypothesize that the development of social innovation partnerships characterized by process-based trust is conducive to their success in better serving the needs of a given community (i.e., scaling deep) in particular under conditions of environmental uncertainties, while brokered access and formal mechanisms enhance partners ability to expand their initiatives in new communities (i.e., scale up). We develop our context-specific hypotheses in the Italian social innovation field based on an original database of Italian social innovation partnerships."
2018,"The Roots of a Hybrid: The Impact of Adoption Conditions on Organizational Hybridity As organizational hybridity has proliferated across a growing number of sectors, the topic has increasingly attracted the attention of scholars. Researchers have largely been interested in the tensions that hybrid organizations face, especially how organizational leaders might manage these tensions. Yet, little attention has been paid to how organizations become hybrid in the first place. This is problematic because hybridization processes are likely to determine what tensions arise and if and how leaders might respond to those tensions. In particular, I consider how variation in when and why an organization becomes hybrid is likely to shape organizational leaders understanding of the hybridity, the extent to which organizational members are likely to identify with each aspect of the hybridity, and leaders ability to manage those identifications. I suggest that these factors determine the nature and extent of associated intra-organizational conflict. Further, although scholars have suggested that hybrid organizations often face challenges associated with excessive conflict, I argue that later introductions of hybridity are likely to generate insufficient conflict. My analysis suggests we need to rethink many of our core assumptions about organizational hybridity and direct our focus towards understanding hybridization as a dynamic process."
2018,"Inside a Multinational Corporation Combining Commercial and Social Objectives This qualitative study explores whether, and if so how, a multinational corporation can organize itself to develop internal ventures that pursue blended, commercial and social, value at the base of the pyramid (BoP). Comparing four such BoP ventures combining commercial and social objectives inside a multinational corporation, we find that structural origins (differentiated or integrated) and operational relatedness (higher or lower) did not determine whether BoP ventures could develop internally. We find that BoP ventures with different structural origins and degrees of relatedness developed internally, instead of spinning out from the corporation, by extricating from standard corporate rules primarily centered on short-term profit maximization and corresponding uncertainty avoidance. They did so with the support of top and senior managers from organizational units with high decision-making power, who could thereby play the role of extricator. This rule extrication involved three components: permission, which authorized departure from standard activities; fluid metrics, which provided a rationale for high risk and uncertainty; and an expedient process, which provided space for experimentation over time. Overall, this study contributes to emergent theory of how large corporations can fulfill the growing external demands and their own internal commitments to deliver social value alongside profit."
2018,"Organizational Identification in Hybrid Organizations Hybrid organizations are governed by multiple, possibly contradictory institutional logics, challenging their members on the clarity of organizational goals and consistency of activities. Here we explore how an organizations hybridity affects members organizational identification. Using institutional and self-affirmation theory, we pose a negative relationship between an individuals purism  being committed to only one of the logics present  and their identification with a hybrid organization. We further argue that this negative effect of purism is mitigated by the individuals perception of senior managers values and beliefs and the individuals perception of the compatibility of the logics governing the hybrid organization. We test and find support for our hypotheses using multi-source data on 624 scientists at a leading research university. Our study contributes to work on hybrid organizations by proposing self-continuity as the determining mechanism for organizational identification in this context. We also contribute to studies of individual responses to institutional complexity by identifying an important organizational-level outcome of these responses."
2018,"Life beyond emergence: Institutional intermediaries and the persistence of hybrid forms We report on a multi-level longitudinal study investigating a population of public-private hybrid organizations in the Italian healthcare field, where a public service and quasi-market logic coexist. A combination of survey, interviews and archival data allowed us to trace the dynamics of persistence and decay of two hybrid templates over 25 years (1992-2016). By bridging the literature on institutional complexity and hybrids with insights from imprinting, we illuminate the role of field-level actors (regional authorities) who as institutional intermediaries and agents of recursive imprinting embed their prioritization of institutional logics in distinct templates for organizing, and provide them to hybrid organizations during multiple sensitive periods over time. Our findings draw attention to the differential institutional capacity of institutional intermediaries to prioritize and enforce institutional logics, and to the diverse relational, procedural and discursive mechanisms they employ during imprinting processes. Ultimately, our findings advance the understanding of how certain hybrid forms come to persist while others decay."
2018,"Differential Effects of Performance Feedback on Multiple Strategic Changes Product and geographic diversification are both important corporate strategies for firm growth and performance. Yet, some firms choose to emphasize one form of diversification over the other. A handful of studies have shown that resource constraints and prior experience with a particular form of diversification matter in explaining why firms prioritize one type of diversification over the other. However, we still have very little understanding about how firms choose its expansion strategy. To further address this question, we investigate the relationship between performance feedback and the extent to which firms pursue product and geographic expansions. We propose that as performance drops below the aspiration level, product diversification increases more than geographic diversification as a means to improve performance. As performance rises above the aspiration level, product diversification is reduced more than geographic diversification because the former may hurt profitability but the latter could sustain long-term performance. These relationships are contingent on organizational size in light of its search implications. During performance deteriorations, larger firms are less likely to embrace product and geographic diversification due to bureaucratic controls that constrain strategic change. By contrast, during outperformance, larger firms prefer both types of diversification due to slack resources that facilitate strategic change. Empirical results using Standard & Poors 1500 firms from 1998 to 2006 broadly support our hypotheses."
2018,"Analyzing the Effects of Performance Feedback on Sharing and Bearing Risk: A Meta-Analysis Performance feedback theory is used to explain various forms of organizational actions. The central proposition of the theory is that organizations change the intensities of these actions depending on their performance relative to an aspiration level. While the effects of performance feedback on organizational actions are differentiated for different feedback mechanisms, it is assumed that they are independent of the type of action. However, recent proliferations in performance feedback research suggest that the degrees and types of risks associated with these different actions may play an important role on these relationships. Therefore, we propose to differentiate the effects of performance feedback for the organizational actions with opposing risks management alternatives; risk sharing and risk bearing actions. We use meta- analytical techniques to test our differentiation hypotheses. Our results show that performance below aspirations has a stronger impact on risk sharing actions, while performance above aspirations has a stronger impact on risk bearing actions. Further, we find that performance relative to social aspiration has a stronger impact on risk sharing actions, while performance relative to historical aspiration has a stronger impact on risk bearing actions. Given that the differences depend on the risk management preferences, we draw important implications for the performance feedback theory and the behavioral theory of the firm."
2018,"How Do Private Firms Respond To Performance Feedback? The Role of Governance and Self-Enhancement Despite the substantial growth of research on performance feedback and strategic changes, few studies consider the role of governance in guiding a firms response to low performance. In this paper, we explore the impact of board independence on performance feedback in private firms. This domain is theoretically intriguing because the owners of these firms are deeply (if not directly) involved in firm oversight and most are owner-managed. Yet, despite the alignment of ownership interest and reduced need to monitor management, most private firms appoint boards. While prior literature frequently argued that boards merely have a symbolic function in private firms, we extend theory to argue that owners have incentive to appoint boards to limit the potential detrimental impact that self-enhancement and other sources of bias can have on decision-making in this setting. Using 19 years of data from 8,543 Belgian private firms, we find that strategic investment in response to low performance increases with board independence, and decreases with director affiliation. Overall, this paper turns attention to the role of governance in guiding private firms' responses to performance feedback, and begins to incorporate research on individual level cognitive processes with organizational level research on performance feedback."
2018,"The Contingent Role of Environmental Context in Organizations Aspiration Determination This article investigates the contingent role of environmental context in organizations aspiration determination from the lens of Attention-Based View (ABV). While aspiration determination models have been widely examined and used, we know little about the contingencies that can further increase the precision of these models. The behavioral view embraces the notion that organizations determine aspirations based on three reference points  prior aspiration, prior performance, and prior performance and comparable organizations. By extending this view, we contend that environmental munificence, dynamism, and complexity are prominent situational factors that can shape organizations attention allocation among these three reference points. Using data on US publicly traded firms (1998-2016), we found that organizations, when determining aspirations, (1) allocate more attention to prior aspiration and comparable organizations performance, but less attention on prior performance in highly-munificent environments; (2) allocation more attention to prior performance and comparable organizations performance in highly-dynamic environments; and (3) allocate more attention to prior aspiration but less attention on prior performance in highly-complex environments. Overall, we contribute to the behavioral view of aspiration determination by explicitly theorizing a previously omitted contingency variable - the external environment."
2018,"Born to Take Risk? The Effect of CEO Birth Order on Strategic Risk Taking The importance of birth order has been the subject of debate for centuries and has captured the attention of the general public and researchers alike. Despite this interest, scholars have little understanding of the impact birth order has on CEOs and their strategic decisions. With this in mind, we develop theory that explains how CEO birth order may be associated with strategic risk taking. Drawing from evolutionary theory arguments related to birth order, we theorize that CEO birth order is positively associated with strategic risk taking; that is, earlier born CEOs will take less risk than later-born CEOs. As evolutionary theory proposes that birth order effects are driven by sibling rivalry, we also argue that this relationship is moderated by three factors related to sibling rivalry: age gap between a CEO and the closest born sibling, CEO age, and the presence of a sibling executive in the same firm. Our results provide support for our theorizing and suggest that birth order may have important implications for organizations. We believe this study helps advance strategic management research, the broader multi-disciplinary family science literature, and the much needed cross-pollination of ideas between the two."
2018,"Explaining Bi-Directional Spillovers from the Same Event: Theory and Evidence from CEO Deaths In this study, we unpack why a single event affecting a focal firm may be expected to have opposing spillover effects to other related firms. We contextualize our theorization and our specific hypotheses by focusing on how the sudden death of a CEO triggers spillover effects onto other listed firms. We contrast the positive spillover predictions based on competitive interdependence with negative spillover predictions based on entitativity perception due to category similarity. In particular, we examine three key dimensions that may generate both positive and negative spillover effects  size similarity, geographic proximity, and demographic similarity of CEOs. We test our predictions by examining investor reactions of 54,819 firms to the 49 sudden deaths of CEOs between 1993 and 2016. Our results indicate that both spillovers co-exist. Theoretical implications are discussed."
2018,"The Paradox of Awards: How Status Spillover and Status Ripples Affect Who Benefits From CEO Awards Distinguishing between status spillovers and status ripples, we argue that sudden positive status shifts create status ripples when the social actors experiencing the status shifts are more constrained from fully exploiting their new status advantages than the social actors to whom they are affiliated. We emphasize specifically the status ripple paradox that the indirect status effects experienced by the affiliated actors can be as important and sometimes more enduring than the direct status effects experienced by the upwardly mobile actors themselves. Focusing empirically on prestigious CEO awards from U.S. news magazines, we examine the consequences of status shifts for the awarded CEOs and the CEOs who are directors on the awarded CEOs boards at the time of the award. We find evidence of status ripples in CEO compensation by showing that awarded CEOs have relatively greater immediate but smaller subsequent increases in compensation and partial evidence of status ripples in directorships by showing that they have similar immediate but smaller subsequent increases in the number of directorships."
2018,"CEO Ideology, Peer Influence, and Adoption of CSR Executive Position by Fortune 500 Firms Prior research in upper echelons suggests that CEO values shape the decisions and outcomes of their firms. Our study extends this literature by considering how CEO values, conceptualized in terms of CEO political ideology (on the conservatism-liberalism spectrum), can influence other CEOs strategic decisions. Specifically, we integrate research on upper echelons with inter-organizational imitation to argue that ideological incongruencei.e., the perceived incompatibility between a CEOs values and the new practice they adopt positively affects its subsequent adoption by other CEOs. In particular, we theorize that conservative-leaning CEOs decisions to adopt a CSR executive position (i.e., appoint a CSR specialist in the top management team) will be imitated at a higher rate by observing CEOs than those of liberal-leaning CEOs due to the increased perceptual salience and situational attributions associated with ideologically-incongruent actions. We further posit that these effects will be stronger when observing CEOs themselves lean conservative and when observing firms experience shareholder pressure to improve their CSR efforts. We test these ideas in a sample of Fortune 500 companies during 2001-2013 and find broad support for our hypotheses. Additionally, in supplementary experimental analyses, we find some evidence for our envisioned theoretical mechanisms."
2018,"Executive Deviance as a Sociopolitical Force in Dismissals Fredrickson et al. (1988) provided a model for CEO dismissals which utilize four sociopolitical forces that operate together in determining whether a CEO will be dismissed. Missing from Fredrickson et al.s (1988) sociopolitical forces is executive deviance. We propose the inclusion of executive deviance as the fifth sociopolitical force in CEO dismissals, which is not limited to the deviant actions of the executive, but also the executives subordinates. Within Fredrickson et al.s CEO dismissal framework, the effect of executive deviance on head coach dismissals in the National Football League (NFL) from the 2000-2001 to 2015-2016 season is examined using four levels of executive deviance: (a) deviance committed directly by the executive, (b) minor workplace deviance by employees, (c) serious workplace deviance by employees, and (d) off-duty deviance by employees. Logistic regression results indicate all four levels of executive deviance increase the likelihood of executive dismissal and have more substantial effects than organizational performance. We encourage researchers to include executive deviance within their comprehensive, ceteris paribus models of CEO dismissals, empirically test the effects of executive deviance in various industries, and revisit past models of executive dismissals to mitigate potentially erroneous statistical results from confounding variables."
2018,"New Practice Creation through Value Elaboration: The Case of Magnum Photos In this historical case study of the revolutionary photo agency Magnum Photos, we elaborate on the institutional logics perspective to answer the question: why and how do agents create novel practices which go against existing institutional arrangements? Based on qualitative analysis of unique data, manually collected from multiple private and public sources, we suggest that such practices are created through a reflexive process we term as value elaboration. In this three-stage process, actors mould and express their personal identities. It starts with a passionate commitment to certain institutional values which are then translated into a specific project. Realization of the project, which is in conflict with institutional status-quo, necessitates the creation of radically new practices. At the centre of the proposed explanation are agents who are voluntarily committed to institutional values, and free to enact them in novel ways. Bringing the concept of personal identity as constituted by the constellation of value commitments to the forefront provides vantage-ground for addressing the paradox of embedded agency. Introducing project as a transitional stage between values and practices provides deeper understanding of their non- deterministic relationship. Our study contributes to the institutional logics perspective by developing a richer concept of agency which goes beyond the currently prevailing cognitive bent."
2018,"Status, Evaluation, and Paradox While long held views across diverse literatures stipulate that status leads to more favorable inferences in evaluations of quality, recent research contends that status can actually cause less favorable evaluations because status encourages consumption by individuals with preferences that are relatively misaligned with the evaluated offering. In order to understand this paradox and systematically investigate the consequences of status on evaluation, I develop a theoretical framework that incorporates both the direct and indirect effects of status in markets while considering that there are heterogeneous effects of status on different consumer types. I argue that early consumers make stronger identity claims through consumption and consequently exhibit stronger socio-cognitive effects stemming from status. As such, even with a corresponding increase in marginal consumers, status causes an overall positive effect on evaluation (i.e., more favorable evaluations) for early consumers. For late consumers, however, status primarily affects evaluation through encouraging consumers with relatively misaligned tastes to enter the market causing an overall negative effect on evaluation (i.e., less favorable evaluations). I employ a regression discontinuity design as an identification strategy and test my theoretical framework using 70,903 individual evaluations on Rotten Tomatoes of 132 movies that were released between 2000 and 2007. My findings, offering support to the theoretical framework, indicate that status encourages consumers to enter the market, with status causing early consumers to evaluate an offering more favorably whereas status causes later consumers offer relatively less favorable evaluations."
2018,"Business Model Innovation for Sustainability: A Translation Perspective  The objective of the paper is to investigate the adoption process of business models for sustainability. Conducting an empirical case study at an established utility company in Sweden, we explore the journey of a new business model for solar energy. Building on a translation perspective, our study opens up the black box of how organizations adopt new business models from its idea to its implementation. We argue that translation is inevitable for a new business model to fit its organizational context. Our results show that the translation process of the new business model goes through four key mechanisms--strategizing, interpreting, embedding and testing--and highlights the central role played by the idea owners and sustainability, as organizational values, in this process."
2018,"Cool Factory: Recurrent Change as Strategy for Advantage This field study at a project led by a pioneering design studio builds theory about how cool factories reconfigure dynamic capabilities to sustain their positions as avant-garde leaders. Working from three years of participant observation and unstructured interviews with key informants, I draw on the resource-based-view in strategy to observe and explain an organizational response to imitation that mirrors the wider creative industry imperative to recurrently change the offering. The study reveals that members exploit slack and simultaneously engage in the exploration of new opportunities on the same project, which is recognizable in routines for slack cultivation, adaptation and creative experimentation."
2018,"Governance Bundles and Acquirer return Grounded in agency theory, this study investigates mixed findings for acquirer returns in takeovers (M&As;) by considering combined external governance mechanisms like shareholder proposals of acquirers shareholder. We focus on specifically combined shareholder proposals and their influence on acquirer returns by using an event study. We analyze the share price reactions to 369 shareholder proposals submitted at 170 acquirers. Our results show that single governance mechanisms influence the share price reaction of acquirers at takeover announce-ment differently than bundles of governance mechanisms do. With our research we contribute to M&A; literature which calls for more research on how corporate governance issues influence acquisitions and on shareholder activism literature, by adding to the discussion on how differ-ent types of shareholder activism affect firm performance differently."
2018,"When is Centrality-based Advantage Absent? The Case of Cross-Border Venture Capital Syndication I re-evaluate the classic positive centrality-performance relationship in the setting of nascent venture capital (VC) industry in China, where foreign entrants from Western developed markets and indigenous firms born in the transitional economy operate in the same market space. Mixed methodologies are employed in this study. Network visualizations reveal two findings on macro-level structures of the industry network. First, a network structural change in the level of interaction between foreign VCs and domestic VCs in China happened when equity market -- the most import financial institution supporting VC, was installed. Second, during the low interaction stage, foreign VCs formed a highly interconnected sub-network, while domestic VCs sub-network remained fragmented. Further, regression analysis results from multi-year data show nuanced findings on the classic centrality- performance relationship. Firms reside in networks whose composition is heterogenous and therefore provide diverse information and resources would benefit from occupying central positions. When the composition of the network is homogenous, central firms in fragmented network would experience better performance, while central firms in highly interconnected network no longer show superior performance than their peers."
2018,"Top Executive Learning and Breakthrough Inventions We integrate learning theories and strategic leadership research to explain how top executives prior experiences with successful breakthrough inventions influence a firms future performance in creating breakthrough technologies. Our theory suggests that a firms future performance in creating breakthrough inventions is 1) positively influenced by top executives experiences with the firms prior successful breakthroughs, 2) negatively influenced by their experiences with successful breakthroughs at former employers, and 3) positively influenced by top executives exposures to the successes of the firms rivals. Moreover, the positive effect of top executives experiences with the firms prior successes is strengthened by their exposures to former employers successes, but weakened by their exposures to the successes of the firms rivals. Using a longitudinal data set on firms breakthrough inventions in innovation-intensive industries in the U.S. and their top executives career histories, we find support for our theoretical expectations."
2018,"A configurational perspective on the role of the quad model and context for board engagement Why are some boards of directors highly engaged in carrying out both their monitoring and service roles, while others are not? To examine this question, our study builds on Hambrick, Misangyi and Parks (2015) theoretical quad model, which proposes that the likelihood of boards effectively fulfilling their monitoring duties depends upon directors having simultaneously four key attributes: independence, expertise in the area being monitored, eagerness, and bandwidth. Rather than just focus exclusively on a boards monitoring role, we propose that the quad attributes will also affect the extent to which directors engage in their service role. We also, suggest that the saliency of the quad model for predicting the extent to which boards will be more likely to engage in their dual role will be greater if the four dimensions are considered from a configurational perspective. As such, consistent with the configurational perspective and the fsQCA technique, our findings show that the level of board engagement in our sample firms depends upon the overall configuration of quad model attributes and contextual elements. We show that there are multiple ways the quad board attributes bundle and combine with important elements of the context to lead to either high or low levels of board engagement. In contrast to previous research that has largely focused on how a particular board or contextual attribute has a net effect on governance outcomes, we show the importance of taking into account both equifinality and causal asymmetry."
2018,"Director Tenure and Effectiveness: A Contingency Model The effects of director tenure on director effectiveness are complex and dynamic. Longer tenured directors can become too entrenched with management which contributes to poor decision making and lack of objective monitoring, while new directors often need time to acquire the firm-specific knowledge and experience to perform their job well. Indeed, researchers have shown the peak effectiveness period for a director occurs sometime in between these late and early periods, or put differently, there is a curvilinear relationship between individual director tenure and effectiveness. In this paper, we build off these largely empirical studies of director tenure and develop a theoretical contingency model that 1) identifies three distinct phases of director effectiveness, and 2) addresses contingencies affecting the speed of reaching, and duration of peak director effectiveness. In sum, we develop theory to answer the question, What are the contingencies that affect director effectiveness, and how do these change over the course of a directors tenure in a firm?"
2018,"Imprints of a World to Come: Nonconformity in Chicago Architecture Firms, 1928-2000 Entrepreneurs often face pressure to conform with the dominant institutional logic or logics in their fields and to adopt organizational traits and strategies that follow from these logics. This pressure may be especially acute in professionalized fields, where the collective norms of what is seen to be important, right, and good are constructed and enforced by the professions themselves. But when the economic and social environment is in turmoil, do these conformity pressures remain relevant for new firms? Or, instead, when the institutional and economic context is in flux, are new firms adopting non- conformist organizational forms and strategies more likely to survive than those that follow convention? Through a longitudinal study of 3,882 Chicago- area architecture firms from 1928 to 2000, this study contributes to our understanding of organizations by proposing and testing a two- stage theoretical model of institutional slack and anticipatory fit, in which conformity pressures are relaxed as crisis conditions take hold, and firms may choose to bear the imprint of an emerging, but still marginal, environmental condition. I suggest that this imprinting occurs through firms relationships to clients as part of the project team, and that it may be associated with a reduced hazard rate, both initially and over time."
2018,"What explains the dormant stage of management ideas: The case of integrated reporting Using a theoretical framework that combines elements from the management fashion theory with the so-called virus metaphor (Rvik, 2011), we analyze the case of integrated reporting (IR) in Germany, a management idea mainly applied by multinational corporations to combine financial and non-financial reporting practices. Building on qualitative data from the German IR and non-financial disclosure landscape gathered over a two-year timeframe, we examine why IR  despite its strong initial popularity in academia and business practice  remains in a dormant stage: The idea of IR is neither moving towards full adoption nor becoming a fad and being abandoned. Our data sheds light on the field level conditions that might explain this continuous dormant stage where key actors in the field approach IR with a wait-and-see perspective. We find that dormancy is facilitated by low demand of reporting organizations due to lack of tangible benefits and low reputational gains, a more supply- than demand-driven market environment for IR, and maintained by subliminal regulatory threat. These findings theoretically expand the virus perspective on the organizational handling of management ideas by putting the roles of different field-level actors that can influence the dormancy of management ideas into a common conceptual framework."
2018,"Performance effects of management ideas in an economic crisis: an empirical study In this paper, I research the impact of management idea bundles on the economic success of firms vis--vis the new institutional idea that an organizations isomorphism with the environment secures the inflow of resources and success. As such performance effects may be accentuated in situations of high ambiguity and uncertainty, the effects of management idea isomorphism and organizational cognition are empirically researched over the course of a recession and recovery cycle of a market economy. The results of the analysis speak in favor of such performance effects."
2018,"TQM implementation: From institutionalization to superior performance attainment Drawing on institutional theory and the resources and capabilities view, this study aims to shed light on the idea that isomorphic organizational changes seek legitimacy over efficiency. Our study concludes that both objectives are simultaneously achievable when we focus on the isomorphic implementation of the total quality management (TQM) philosophy as an integrative stream of both theories. Hence, we propose a meta-model that jointly collects these relationships as well as the impact that these objectives might have on the firms overall performance. To test this research model and hypotheses we use of survey data from 102 medium and large Spanish companies that belong to distinct sectors and are of different sizes. This paper performs partial least squares (PLS) structural equation modeling to empirically test the hypothesized relationships. This work corroborates that institutional pressures significantly condition the implementation of TQM. In addition, the efficiency and legitimacy objectives are both achieved by means of TQM implementation, which plays a mediating role. However, we observe a dual phenomenon: (i) while we find a significant positive effect of TQM on overall performance based on efficiency, (ii) we failed to find support for the TQM-overall performance link based on legitimacy."
2018,"The accidental implementation of an institutional ritual The coupling of organizational policy with practice is customarily attributed to the presence of institutional pressures. This paper reports a study of an international non-governmental organization (INGO) in which day-to-day practice was coupled with symbolic rituals in spite of the absence of institutional pressures. This disconfirmatory finding indicates the need to move away from structural-deterministic models of coupling that presume a functional compliance between external pressures and organizational practices  toward fresh perspectives that shed light to latent phenomenological processes underlying the substantive implementation of organizational rituals. To this end, we propose that coupling can be an unintended organizational state made possible due to failure to appreciate the cynical and mythological underpinnings of institutional rituals."
2018,"The Role of Metaphors in Making Sense of the Future - A Collective and Temporally Embedded Process How do metaphors help organizational members make sense of the future in uncertain, divergent and complex conditions? We conducted a qualitative study of strategy making at Fe y Alegria, a global faith-inspired federation of national organizations which offer educational opportunities to the poor in developing and developed countries. Our research suggests that individuals struggle to make sense of their organizational future when disruptions in present conditions surface and when the past is no longer a source of information. However, through the use of metaphors actors can find novel ways of coping with uncertainty, divergence of interests and complexity in order to envision diversified organizational futures. Our analysis contributes to organization theory by showing how processes of making sense of the future through metaphors are based on the interplay of cognitive and dialogical practices that take place at the collective level. Finally, we proposed a metaphorical process model for making sense of the future based collective constructions."
2018,"Knowledge co-creation in teams: Knowledge diversity, perspective taking and collective sensemaking We employed a process research lens to investigate knowledge co-creation by teams in a technology transfer project conducted within a large multinational firm. The project involved an expert team responsible for disseminating knowledge relating to the technology (disseminating team) and a team responsible for receiving and implementing that technology (recipient team). Our analysis is based on a total of 28 interviews, archival data, and direct observation of project team meetings over 10 months. Our findings revealed that the first step in knowledge co-creation is involving the right people. Additionally, we found that knowledge co-creation was enacted as a function of perspective taking and collective sensemaking. The various parties i.e., disseminating team, recipient team, and external contractors, involved in this collaborative effort each contributed their distinct knowledge. Collectively, through knowledge diversity, and by undertaking the processes of perspective taking and collective sensemaking, the co-created knowledge reflected attributes of (1) multifacetedness; (2) utility; (3) shared ownership; and (4) enhanced quality. Additionally, we found that enablers of perspective taking and collective sensemaking were psychological safety climate, formalizing meetings, and stability of team membership. Key inhibiting factors included resource constraints, and managing risks and uncertainties. Our research has important implications for studying knowledge co-creation within sender-user teams, and knowledge transfer effectiveness."
2018,"Organizing to Save Lives: Post-Inquiry Sensemaking & Learning in Bushfire Emergency Organizations We examine how emergency management organizations in the state of Victoria in Australia implemented recommendations made by an inquiry into a major bushfire disaster  known as Black Saturday. Learning from rare events like Black Saturday is often difficult for organizations and, yet, it is crucial if lives are to be saved in future fires. We adopt a sensemaking perspective that also takes into account organizational learning to examine the post-inquiry situation i.e., how emergency management practitioners implemented equivocal recommendations in their organizations with a view to ensuring that they would be better prepared and better equipped to deal with similar incidents in the future. Our findings show how retrospective and prospective sensemaking after the inquiry resulted in four different types of learning that enabled practitioners to implement the recommendations in their organizations. We develop a model of post-inquiry sensemaking and learning, integrating the traditional sensemaking literature with more recent theoretical work that draws on Heideggers work."
2018,"No End in Sight.The wickedness of global displacement or how refugee crises are enacted over time. This study examines how organizations may enact wicked problems over time. While research interested in wicked problems and grand challenges so far mainly explored how organizations respond to global social problems, less attention has been given to how such wicked problems are constituted over time as organisations respond to them. Drawing on Weicks concept of Enacting as Intensifying, and relying on a longitudinal ethnographic case study of a humanitarian crisis in Rwanda, we disclose practices of intensification that turn refugee camps into dangerous social hotspots, and shed light on alternative practices such as online cash assistance that de- intensify the crisis. We conceptualize these dynamics of intensifying wicked problems as spatial and temporal containment, and refer to processes of de- intensification as temporal and spatial diffusion. In doing so, we first contribute to the literature on wicked problems and grand challenges by specifying the underlying dynamics of such problems chronic persistence. Second, we extend the enactment perspective to large-scale crises situations and emphasize the role of trait-making organizations in re-enacting global wicked problems over time."
2018,"Rocket Ship and Roller Coaster: Reimagining Startups and their Role in the New Economy Few have contested that work and organizations have transformed in meaningful ways over the past few decades, leading to the rise of what many call a new economy. Notably, interest in entrepreneurship and startup companies has skyrocketed amidst the rise of the new economy. In examining the role that startups will play in the new economy, researchers have enthusiastically linked startups with favorable trends such as job creation. However, these depictions have been overly positive and have neglected to address the negative consequences that startups may have. Drawing on an influential history of scholarship on the dark side of organizational life, we inductively studied a startup which built up employee commitments to its core value of transparency and later reneged on the value. In particular, we unearthed the emotional pain and disillusionment that employees experienced after the company reneged on transparency as a core value. We believe that these employees heartbreaking experiences highlight startups capacity to harm their employees. Our case thus provides a cautionary tale on the negative consequences that working within startup companies can have, helping us to ultimately rethink the positive depictions of startups role in the new economy which currently dominate the academic and popular imagination."
2018,"The Genesis and Metamorphosis of Imprints: How Business Model Innovation Evolves in Young Firms In this research, we ask whether founders imprint business model innovation and what mechanisms they use to do so. Grounded in an in- depth longitudinal multiple-case study of six new ventures, we develop a theoretical framework that explains how founders shape the degree of business model innovation of their firms. Our findings suggest that, besides their direct impact on structural business model imprints, founders also shape cognitive practices in their young firms that in turn affect business model innovation. Our emerging theoretical framework contributes theoretically to imprinting research by revealing an interaction between cognitive and structural imprints in organizations and by delineating the mechanisms of novelty imprinting. Our research also sharpens the theoretical understanding of business model innovation by highlighting the dynamics underlying its genesis and metamorphosis."
2018,"Going Viral or Growing Like an Oak Tree? How Growth Perspectives Shape Nascent Business Ideas Rapid growth is often considered a hallmark of success in the contemporary entrepreneurship. Research and practice commonly focus on how emerging businesses achieve higher growth rates, implicitly assuming that quick scaling is quintessential for the commercial success of ventures as well as the impact of social enterprises. However, our 22-month ethnographic study in two business incubators in Detroit revealed that quick scaling may not be the only way a business grows successfully. We inductively identify two contrasting growth perspectives, which we label as viral spreading and organic development, and document how they differently shape the trajectories of idea development of emerging businesses. When the pursuit of viral spreading compelled entrepreneurs to prioritize quickly scalable solutions, business ideas were developed by first refining solutions and then defining problems. In contrast, the vision of organic development enabled entrepreneurs to refine problems before defining solutions. Our study proposes expanding our conception of organizational growth and reveals the peril of the contemporary entrepreneurships obsession with quick scaling."
2018,"Minority Entrepreneurship and Alternative Opportunities Inside Established Organizations Whereas prior research has documented persistent inequality in entrepreneurial performance between African American and White entrepreneurs, less attention has been devoted to investigating whether and how racial minorities cope with such obstacles. In this study, we propose and empirically document one such adaptation strategy: the pursuit of a new venture through intrapreneurship or within employer organizations. Analyzing a representative sample of entrepreneurs in the United States from the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics II, we found that, relative to Whites, African Americans are more likely to found new businesses through intrapreneurship than through entrepreneurship. We further show that, individuals from disadvantaged groups are more likely to seek funding to start a new business from employers than marketplace investors. Consistent with the notion that employer firms provide more support to minorities than do investors in the market, we find lesser disparities across minorities and non-minorities in accumulation of entrepreneurial resources internally. Our findings also suggest that minorities are more motivated to grow new ventures, when exploiting these new businesses within an employer organization than through an independent startup. Finally, our results lend support to the notion that intrapreneurship offers a substitute for entrepreneurship: we find that the tendency to pursue internal ventures is amplified when opportunities for startups are scarce, and when minorities perceive other venues of advancement as inferior to intrapreneurship. More generally, the study illuminates a novel adaptation strategy to address barriers that minorities face within an entrepreneurial setting."
2018,"A Tale of Two Cycles: Understanding Construct Development in Organization Studies This paper describes two construct development cycles that I argue are common in the discipline of organization studies. In the first, which I label a non-instrumented construct development cycle, broadly conceptualized constructs are subject to a wide range of operationalizations, which feed back to add additional meanings to the construct. The result is a self-reinforcing loop in which the concept moves toward the status of an umbrella construct as it ages. In the second cycle, which I call an instrumented construct development cycle, this self-reinforcing dynamic is reversed through the adoption of a standard measuring instrument for the construct. The standard instrument constrains the array of operationalizations that the construct receives, tightening construct boundaries and supporting further use of the standard instrument. While both of these cycles are present in organization studies, the non-instrumented type is more prevalent than the instrumented type. I develop theory about the sub-disciplinary contexts that encourage each type of cycle, and derive testable propositions about the effects of context attributes on these cycles. I also devote attention to the feedback effects of the cycles on the contexts that produce them. Implications for future research on organization studies sub-disciplines are derived, and I recommend the study of sub-disciplines as configurations of ideology, culture, power, and intellectual activity. This paper contributes to the organization studies literature by providing a better understanding of the different causal patterns through which constructs and sub-disciplines evolve over time."
2018,"Umbrella Constructs and Problem-driven Research: A Pragmatist Approach Umbrella constructs play a key role in many organizational theories, but we lack prescriptive accounts of how researchers should use umbrella constructs. This lack of guidance weakens umbrella constructs and makes them the target of much criticism. This paper uses pragmatist philosophy to develop a new definition of umbrella constructs and to offer specific guidance on how researchers can strengthen umbrella constructs for problem-driven research. We argue that what holds an umbrella construct together are not shared ontological assumptions, but specific real-world problems that the construct helps address. To strengthen an umbrella construct, researchers need to develop a shared understanding of a big picture problem that the umbrella construct helps addressing from multiple viewpoints. In turn, big picture problems help define the boundaries of an umbrella construct and integrate knowledge across the different constructs that constitute an umbrella construct. To illustrate our argument, we focus on organizational field as a key umbrella construct in management research. We argue that this construct helps addressing the big picture problem of creating collective rationality and we identify a new problem-driven research agenda on organizational fields."
2018,"Symbolic Capital: A Promising Construct for Organizational Research The concept of symbolic capital is employed within an increasing number of studies in fields as diverse as anthropology, economics, political science, sociology, management, and entrepreneurship. In this paper, we aim to clarify the concept of symbolic capital by synthesizing theoretical and empirical knowledge accumulated on the concept and by developing a theoretical framework that identifies the origins or sources, advantages, disadvantages, and outcomes of symbolic capital. This synthesizing task and the associated framework then permits us to start theorizing about usefulness of the concept for future organizational theory and research."
2018,"New Technology Development: Deconstructing Environmental Uncertainty in Transaction Cost Economics This article deconstructs environmental uncertainty in technological research and development (R&D;) projects. Deconstructing environmental uncertainty allows us to introduce a transient view on transactions and governance choice. Drawing on the bounded rationality assumption in transaction cost economics (TCE), we augment TCE with the perceptual types of state, effect uncertainty and response uncertainty. While effect uncertainty is being perceived by managers at the beginning of a technological trajectory favoring market governance forms, response uncertainty becomes the dominant type of uncertainty perceived by managers when the technological trajectory is already rife assuming asset specificity is present to a non-trivial degree. In contrast, state uncertainty has a differential effect on governance form depending the source it originates from. In this respect, high levels of response uncertainty are associated with hierarchical governance. As a result, managers favor different types of governance forms throughout the evolution of a technology."
2018,"Similarity, Status, and Uncertainty in Film Production Studies of collaboration show that people tend to choose partners who are similar to them. Research also advances, however, that diversity is important to performance, suggesting that sometimes, people choose dissimilar others for collaboration. Hence, in this paper, I investigate what might lead one to bypass similar others. Specifically, I suggest that both status and uncertainty affect the preference for collaborator similarity. High status creates interest among potential collaborators which gives options to work with diverse people but the risk of status loss also gives one reasons to rely on similar others. In addition, managers cope with perceived uncertainty by either associating with diverse partners or sticking with similar partners. Examining these opposing responses to both status and uncertainty, this research asks, when do individuals tend to stick with similar others versus break out to try working with dissimilar others? Using data on managers hiring of skilled film technicians in France, results reveal that managers are more likely to work with similar collaborators when they have high status, in addition, we observe that, when uncertainty is low, the preference for similar others disappears. These boundary conditions for the preference for similarity suggest that specific mechanisms drive this preference, which allows us to extend existing theory on homophily as applied to the social networks and the team composition literatures."
2018,"Keeping the Stars in the Sky: Why High-Status Teams Cannot Outperform Others in Innovative Firms This study explores the circumstances in which high-status project teams fail to outperform their low-status counterparts. Analyzing a unique dataset which combines social network and sales data from the video game industry, we find that high status can be more beneficial in less innovative organizations in terms of improving project performance. However, in more innovative organizations high status may prevent teams from receiving resources, and thus be less beneficial. In an additional online survey study, we confirmed that respondents provide high-status teams with fewer resources in innovative environments than they do in non-innovative settings. The implications of our findings for theory and practice are discussed."
2018,"Status Shifts as a Result of Organizational Responses to Institutional Demands How can organizations improve their status given the variety of competing institutional demands they are exposed to? Previous research has provided evidence of the interaction between organizational responses to institutional demands and their status, but little is known about how organizational responses to institutional demands result in status shifts. Based on a review of the literature, I argue that positive and negative responses to institutional demands combine in creating status gain or loss. In particular, I hypothesise that contrary to previous assumptions, positive responses to core institutional demands combine with negative responses to peripheral demands to result in status gain, while inverse configurations result in status loss. I test these hypotheses in the field of elite business schools, where I identify two core institutional demands (Value and Knowledge Creation), and two peripheral demands (Social Justice  Diversity and Sustainability) that business schools respond to in order to shift their status. To address some of the shortcomings of earlier studies, I use a comparative longitudinal Fuzzy Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis to measure the combinations of absolute or relative change in performance in relation to status change. The results provide broad support for my hypotheses."
2018,"How Product Quality and Affinity toward the Firm Influence Reputation for Quality Several calls from the social evaluations literature underscore the importance of investigating the microfoundations of reputation and the potential interplay across social evaluation constructs. With the present study, we employ two controlled, randomized experiments to examine how product quality observations influence ones perceptions of a firms reputation for quality. We show respondents the product qualities of multiple firms for whom respondents hold different levels of affinity, a building block of social approval. In Study 1, we expose respondents to one of four product quality combinations from a high affinity and low affinity firm, and find that both firms reputations for quality are penalized when they underperform their rival. Moreover, while both firms reputations benefit more from higher product quality, neither firm benefits from outperforming the other. In Study 2, we add a fictionalized neutral affinity firm and simplify our product quality primers, finding that whereas the high affinity firm's reputation is damaged by underperforming a lower affinity rival, both lower affinity rivals experience greater reputation penalties when they underperform the high affinity firm. Evidence also suggests thatcounterintuitivelya low affinity firm may be worse off by outperforming a high affinity firm relative to matching their rivals performance."
2018,"What are you doing? Business process outsourcing and the role of tacit knowledge Although business process outsourcing has become a common business practice, there is limited empirical evidence to date that explains the role of tacit knowledge in the transfer of routines. To outsource is to take a routine to another, de-coupled landscape. This rise a question how will the replanting to new setting influence the understanding and through understanding, also the performance of routines and what happens to routines if dragged out from the interdependent bundles of routines. Based on the nine months ethnographic study, I argue that we cannot separate the performer and performing of routines from the organizational settings without changing the intention, performance and possible outcome of performed routines. The richer and deeper is the contextual knowledge, and stronger the relationship between routines and context, the more challenging is the transfer. Moreover, relocating routines from one organization to another do not only change routines over time, but due to the disrupted continuity of performing routines in situ, it changes routines in time. Cutting routines out from the organizational context does not only cut off the relationship between routines and the organizational context but also disrupts the temporal continuity of conducting routines and lead to organizational forgetting."
2018,"Rethinking contextual ambidexterity through parallel structures: The case of Renaults Fab Lab While managers are presented in the literature on innovation management as instrumental in building contextual ambidexterity through establishing a supportive context, our study offers a different stance. We posit parallel structures as alternative spaces to sustain contextual ambidexterity. Our context is a pioneer internal Fab Lab at the worldwide car manufacturer Renault. Overall, we identify three main contributions. First, in depicting Fab Labs as parallel structures, we locate outside of the traditionally identified business unit a source of contextual ambidexterity. Second, we delineate four key functions and related features  spatial, technical, methodological, and cultural  of internal Fab Labs that nurture contextual ambidexterity. Third, we show that despite a non-supportive context inside their respective business units, employees can demonstrate ambidextrous skills, which requires autonomous initiatives and individual transgression, as well as a specific way of facilitating the Fab Labs."
2018,"Elementary Heuristics  Strategically Relevant Knowledge Carriers for Capability Development Capabilities are essential for remaining competitive in turbulent environments. Organizations face the challenge of identifying, building, and refining capabilities as their underlying patterns of success detract from immediate access. Research and practice lack an elaborate understanding as to how individual, organizational, and strategic levels of organizational capabilities are linked. We integrate findings from the heuristics, routines, learning, and dynamic (managerial) capabilities literature on connecting different levels. By using empirical case study data, we shed light into this important field of organization studies by discussing the role of tacit elementary heuristics as strategic knowledge carriers for connecting cognitions and capabilities. We therefore contribute to existing capabilities research (1) by introducing the concept of elementary heuristics as connecting knowledge carriers between cognitions and capabilities, (2) by elucidating and expanding the simple rules-method for identifying, building and refining capabilities by passing through the phases of identification, consolidation, diffusion and reflection & adaptation, and (3) by enlightening the role of meta-capabilities for stimulating reflection and capability monitoring in order to keep pace with dynamic environments."
2018,"Same, same, but different!? A systematic review of the literature on digital transformation Digital Transformation (DT) has become a relevant topic for organizations, industries and society. This paper consolidates the state of the research on digital transformation. Based on a systemic review of literature published over the past 20 years, we synthesize various research perspectives into a comprehensive multi- dimensional framework of digital transformation, linking determinants, processes and outcomes of DT. We also suggest implications for research and practice."
2018,"The Role of Emotions toward Artifacts in Interorganizational Routines This study explores the role of emotions toward artifacts during the performance of interorganizational routines. Drawing on the literature on routine dynamics, and emotion in organizations, I analyze emotions expressed during the interaction between groups of participants in collaborative design projects. Through an interpretive case study, I find that emotions expressed toward design objects (i.e., artifacts) create collective understanding that enables connections among actors. However, emotions are situational in nature and groups do not perform all interdependent routines communally. Thus, new emotions may arise that change one groups understanding and weaken connection between groups. In such cases, participants recreate collective understanding through practice. This study adds to the literature on routine dynamics by demonstrating how emotions contribute to routine performance when they involve participants across organizational boundaries."
2018,"Winning Hearts to Achieve Sustainability: Theorizing Change from an Emotional Perspective I build theory on how actors mobilize emotions to initiate and implement institutional change to achieve sustainability, based on an ethnographic and longitudinal study of a regional water board. The findings suggest that emotions and lived experience orient and enable actors to engage in micro- level processes - acknowledging emotions, learning from other watersheds, addressing fear, fostering hope, turning suspicion and mistrust to respect and trust, establishing moral authority, and cultivating emotional ties - to change water management from a fragmented to a regional, collaborative approach. The process model emerged from the findings highlights the importance of transforming negative emotions to positive ones for the change processes. Emotional transformation provides the emotional foundation for moral authority and emotional ties. In turn, moral authority and emotional ties constitute emotional sources of power. The model also explicates orienting as a mechanism linking lived experience with agency. This novel theorization is appropriate for explaining complex social change (or lack of it) in which no single actor has absolute authority over others. I discuss implications of theorizing emotions as a constitutive element in institutions for the study of institutional change processes, and for the micro-foundations of institutions in general. Keywords: emotions, lived experience, institutional change, positive and negative emotions, fear, hope, suspicion and mistrust, respect and trust, emotional ties, orienting, emotional sources of power, micro-foundations of institutions, ethnography, qualitative method, sustainability"
2018,"Finding a place in heaven: A contextual study of value-laden emotions and work Through an ethnography of Pentecostal churches in Indonesia, we explore how institutional contexts influence the mobilizing potential of values and emotions for institutional work. We found that while values generated emotional energy to take action to fulfill them, they needed a suitable institutional context to be converted into appropriate institutional work. Excitement was an emotion that enabled the conversion of consolidated emotional energy into spirited institutional work, whereas fear was a prevalent component in the conversion of compromised emotional energy into symbolic institutional work. However, we also had a case where the paradoxical emotions of fearful excitement were present simultaneously, entangling the conversion process of complicated emotional energy. Dealing with such a paradox through a heightened emotional investment in their close-knit community, actors were able to perform tempered institutional work."
2018,"Emotions as Discursive Resources for Theorizing Institutional Change In this paper, we take a discursive perspective on emotions and institutional work. We study emotion talk as discursive practice and emotions as discursive, cultural-cognitive resources for theorizing institutional change. Based on a qualitative case study, we examine the ways in which politicians, as local theorizing agents, use fear talk as a discursive strategy to theorize institutional roles and practices in the context of regulatory institutional change. More specifically, we focus on the ways in which institutional actors use socially constructed emotion schematastructured folk knowledge of the antecedents and consequences of emotions in particular contextsas a discursive resource in their theorizing accounts. In the empirical context of a political debate on the introduction of a new regulative institution, we show how proponents and opponents of institutional change evoke and draw upon different schemata of fear  threat-based fear, scaremongering, cowardice, and fear of change  in ways that regulate the foundedness, authenticity, and appropriateness of fear, and thereby its usability as a basis of moral evaluation. Our analysis shows that actors use fear talk as a resource especially for theorizing the moral implications of regulative institutional change and for regulating their own and each others discursive legitimacy as theorizing agents."
2018,"Dynamic de-responsibilization in business-government interactions  Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is defined and enacted in a political governance context involving dynamic interactions between business and government. Recent analyses of such interactions give rise to different models of how social responsibilities are allocated: oscillation between business and government, or mutual accommodation. We know less, however, about how business- government interactions may give rise to corporate social irresponsibility (CSiR). I thus studied interactions between mining companies and government in South Africa, focusing on processes of rule-making and the provision of public goods that contributed to the deterioration of living conditions around mines in the Marikana area, site of an infamous massacre in 2012. The analysis results in a process model of dynamic de-responsibilization, in which practices of government and business, premised upon assumptions of managerial discretion, build upon each other to progressively dissipate social responsibilities by both business and government."
2018,"Strategic CSR Framing by Firms in Emerging Markets International isomorphism is the traditional explanation for emerging firms use of CSR discourse. In a study of 245 firms in 8 countries, we find that although isomorphism explains convergence on one dimension of CSR, firms diverge from the international standard on other frames. This divergence is explained by symbolic management of risk perceptions and performative response within the institutional environment of the home country. Through qualitative and quantitative content analysis we find that environmental and human rights CSR frames focus attention on risk reduction relative to peers while traditional CSR frames portray the firm as a moral exemplar. In a climate of increasing litigiousness and awareness of risk, environmental and human rights discourses are the natural strategic choices of firms when conveying CSR activities. Overall, the environmental dimension increases over time, congruent with the explanation of mimetic isomorphism. However, patterns on a country level reveal that firms remain strategic actors in that they choose frames compatible with local government context, particularly when that government context is strong."
2018,"Shooting for the stars: Co-constructing a professional mandate for corporate social responsibility This paper examines how practitioners of a nascent occupation interact across organizational boundaries to gain legitimacy and construct a professional mandate. We studied corporate social responsibility (CSR), an emerging occupation, whose practitioners work in the intersection of business and society and address companies responsibilities over their social, environmental, and economic impact in the short, medium, and long term. Drawing on a qualitative study of 44 in-house CSR managers and CSR consultants in the UK, we identify collaborative and non-collaborative practices that practitioners enact across organizational boundaries in constructing their professional mandate. We show how in-house CSR managers and CSR consultants work together to elevate the status of their field, to build a community, and to ensure appropriate content and conduct. In so doing, we redefine the role of the client in the occupations and professions literature and advance our understanding of contemporary professionalization strategies."
2018,"Responsible by proxy: Moral and affective micro-foundations to the institutionalization of CSR  This paper examines the micro-foundations of consumer responses to CSR under competitive market conditions. Across three studies, it shows that when firms are seen to practice CSR while their competitors are not, consumers not only reward CSR-practicing firms through their purchases, but also discipline those of their competitors perceived not to practice CSR  even when there is no evidence that such firms have caused any harm. This paper also shows that heuristic processes compel consumers who regard themselves as highly moral to anticipate a greater affective reward than others for (a) supporting firms that practice CSR, and (b) disciplining their CSR non-practicing rivals, thereby leading them to spend more on the products of CSR-practicing firms. This paper further demonstrates that in a multi-firm context firms that practice CSR lose a measure of consumer support when other firms also practice CSR, yet still maintain enough support to incentivize them to continue practicing CSR. Conversely, CSR non- practicing rivals that lag behind are subjected to affect-driven consumer sanctions, thereby incentivizing them to begin practicing CSR. In so doing, this paper contributes to the literatures on moral identity and institutional theory, and sheds light on the competitive micro-dynamics that fuel the institutionalization of CSR."
2018,"Surviving or Thriving: Community Effects on New Firm Performance This paper examines how the local context alters the objectives that new firms pursue. In turn, we offer an explanation of why growth and survival vary among firms in the same industry, despite an expectation that they are exposed to similar social norms and strategic pressures. By focusing at the community-level, we reconcile a conflict in the institutional literature on new firm growth and survival. On the one hand, scholars have long argued that as new firms become more locally embedded, their growth is attenuated because local networks are restricted and local norms constrain available actions. On the other hand, scholars have more recently highlighted the role of community and local logics in fostering new firm outcomes. Whereas prior research has framed the effect of local communities on new firms as either community norms or logics that shape organizational behavior, or as a site of strategic networks that grant access to locally available resources, our paper reconciles these views with the suggestion that as firms become more embedded in their local community they place strategic emphasis on stability and job creation, rather than financial growth. Theoretically, we argue that the more a new firm is socially tied to its local community, the more its performance favors employment and survival. To support these ideas we employ endogenous treatment effects analyses with data from a matched sample of new firms. We find that as a firm is more locally embedded, employment and survival increase compared to otherwise similar firms in that community. Yet, as a firm is more locally embedded, sales grow slower than otherwise similar firms. These findings reconcile two perspectives of organizational behavior as to whether a new firm acts instrumentally to acquire resources (whose availability depends on location) versus the institutionalist view that the community communicates cultural norms that shape organizational action. In other words, by arguing that firms with deep social ties to a community choose objectives and then select actions that are consistent with those community objectives, such as stable employment, we illuminate the role of community on firms and local ties that affect firm performance. Another implication is that employment, survival, and financial growth are key dependent variables in entrepreneurship research that can be confounded if selected without taking the local context into account. Thus, our findings not only uncover a new mechanism to explain the role of employees and community in firm outcomes (the comparative valorization of employment), we also provide a theoretical separation of survival from growth in entrepreneurship studies."
2018,"The Role of Institutional Entrepreneurs in New Ventures: The Emergence of Womens Elite Hockey Drawing upon the research in institutional entrepreneurship, and organizational routines, this project examines how entrepreneurs overcome obstacles in gendered industries. Specifically, we examine the case of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) and their efforts to host the Womens World Hockey Championships (WWHC) as a first step toward womens hockey being included in the Winter Olympics. Before the WWHC, womens hockey was not highly organized or thought of as a popular activity due to the hegemonic masculinity inherent in (mens) hockey. We find that CAHA adjusted two routines (the use of pink in the jersey for the Canadian Womens team and adjusting the rules from body-checking to body-contact) in an effort to increase positive media attention and audience support for the event. The results of these actions not only led to changing how womens hockey is played, but also lead to the inclusion of womens hockey as a winter Olympic event."
2018,"Institutional Resilience and the Role of Entrepreneurship and Guardianship in Swiss Watchmaking This study examines how influential actors in the Swiss watch industry employed history as a strategic resource in response to the introduction of quartz watch technology. Using qualitative data from 136 in-depth interviews with leading industry executives, collectors, auction house operators, and other actors, we examine how institutional entrepreneurs and guardians both influenced the resurgence of Swiss watchmaking. We find that the interaction of actors adopting prospector and defender strategic orientations toward history created a complementarity of technical and symbolic resources. In addition, we identify how mechanisms of technology approbation and creative abrasion resolved inherent tensions between entrepreneurs and guardians, and thus, facilitated institutional resilience and industry adaptation."
2018,"A Path Makes a Road: Path Dependence in Organizational Impression Management Impression management affects how a firm maintains positive evaluator perceptions, an important dimension of firm survival and success. Most scholarship in this area has focused on managing impressions after events. However, a firm may also engage in anticipatory strategies to manage impressions. By synthesizing arguments from anticipatory and reactive impression management, I offer a novel theoretical framework that treats a firms impression management strategies as a path-dependent process. I also consider how firms manage perceptions around positive events, an area of inquiry that lacks sufficient attention yet carries substantial importance. Finally, I develop theory about antecedents to anticipatory impression management and thus link them to the path I explicate above. Together, these contributions illuminate how firm impression management decisions are more nuanced and more predictable than previous research has suggested."
2018,"Strategic-Temporal Framing As Impression Management: Managing Investment Analysts Temporal Focus Board independence and firm performance are of utmost importance to investment analysts who play a key role in determining stakeholders judgments of a firm. Researchers have paid less attention to impression management tactics used in communicating firm performance to analysts. A key tenet of previous research on impression management is that leaders can rely on uncertainty stemming from information asymmetry to manage targets impression of various organizational attributes. However, given the power and the good information access of investment analysts, and the visibility of firm performance, information asymmetry proves less helpful in managing analysts impression. The present paper builds on the premise that uncertainty can stem from temporal distance between the evaluation decision and the evaluation subject. It proposes a novel theory of temporal impression management, which involves strategic distorting of impression management targets temporal focus. Hypotheses are developed and tested using a hand- collected dataset. It is found that when firms perform better (worse) than expectations, leaders reduce (increase) the attention of investment analysts to the past (future) because positive (negative) events are more discounted under a past (future) focus. Moreover, temporal impression management mediates the relationship between firm performance and analysts recommendations, making the stock recommendations more favorable."
2018,"Effects of Substantive Actions on Sensemaking and Strategic Change Implementation The linguistic focus in interpretive studies has received some criticism in recent years. In this paper, I examine the interrelated processes of leaders sensegiving and employees sensemaking during strategic change. Thereby, I focus on how senior managers substantive sensegiving actions can contribute to a shift in the interpretive schemes of organizational members. Building on in-depth data from a qualitative case study of a center-led change initative in a software company, I identify three mechanisms by which substantive actions can contribute to schema change and change implementation. My findings contribute to the literature on sensemaking during organizational change that has largely explored it as a discursive process. Specifically, they show the value of a practical engagement with change that can alleviate pessimistic interpretations and encourage employees support even among business unit members that earlier did not recognize the inherent benefits of the change."
2018,"Acquisitions and the Visual Representation of Strategy Many organizations use some form of visual frameworks for the purpose of sense-making. These frameworks are used to communicate their actions and intentions to stakeholders. We examine the effect of such frameworks in the context of acquisitions. Particularly, we theorize that the stock markets reaction to acquisition announcements is moderated by the use of visualizations. We argue that visualizations help create clarity for investors, resulting in more positive reactions in the stock market, albeit with greater variance  because clarity can also backfire. Furthermore, we argue that the positive effect of these visualizations will be more pronounced in case the acquisitions represent a new course of action for the firm. We test our predictions through a matched sample design of 461 acquisitions by publicly listed US firms. We discuss implications for literatures on sense-making, impression management, and on the use of visual artefacts in management."
2018,"Breaking the Waves: Practicing Phenomenologically Simultaneity in Management Research The temporality of organizations is increasingly at the heart of organization studies research. Nonetheless, there have been few research reports that explore the issue of time in the context of ongoing research practices and their performativity. Indeed, research practices in management are frequently bounded as successive waves in time and space. Knowledge building and knowledge communication, research and practice, teaching and research are disparate and often poorly interrelated practices. Major problems of interpretation in management and organization studies are grounded in different and even conflicting temporal orientations. In this article, a new phenomenological method combining auto-ethnography with action-research that ties these activities together is presented and applied, which we term Open, Walked, Events-Based Experimentation (OWEE). This new method aims at re-introducing simultaneity and fluidity in management research practices that are usually disconnected and doing this with a transformative ambition. It relies on the aesthetics, cultures, techniques and actors of collaborative communities and third-places, in particular coworkers and hackers. A learning expedition in Berlin is used to experiment and refine the research protocol. Merleau-Pontys concepts of modes of expression, embodiment, visibility and event, are used to interpret and extend the process behind OWEE."
2018,"The New Normal in Constant Connectivity: Smartphone Affordances and Liminal Zone in Work Practices The study of constant connectivity has come of age especially with the advent of smartphone and the ubiquity of mobile technology some declare this to be the new normal. As such there have been calls for research that foregrounds this normalcy and offers fresh insights. Our research attempts to address this call by focusing on the materiality of smartphone. Our findings point to the following affordances being enabled by the distinctive touchscreen app-enabled smartphone features: discrete-noticeability; scrollability; and retrieveability. These affordances in turn give rise to a zone of liminality around work practices, whereby actors attend to and handle the incoming communications of their smartphones very seamlessly and with little perception of being interrupted. Our research extends the literature on constant connectivity by highlighting how distinctive materiality of touchscreen app-enabled smartphone relative to its predecessors has given rise to this zone of liminality."
2018,"The performance of authority:How the sharing of action elicits compliance?  As work and organizational reality become increasingly post-bureaucratic, the conventional and stable bases of authority  someones position, their expertise, or a subordinates acquiescence  are eroding. These evolutions call for a revision of our understanding of authority and for more profound considerations of the way it is concretely achieved in both fluid and fragmented contexts. Building on a six-month autoethnography of a consulting assignment, we show that authority is a practical, relational and situated performance. It exists in a tension between two mirroring processes, activation and passivation, by which relations are backgrounded or foregrounded to shape the situation and steer collective action. Our study also reveals that the performance of authority involves people, but also a broader range of actants, including artifacts and abstract entities. In line with current research on performativity and relationality in organizations, our findings contribute to the de-substantializing of authority and the revelation of its sociomaterial dimension. Thus, the following provides an action-based understanding of authority that is better suited for the study of post-bureaucratic organizing."
2018,"Cooking in Dishwashers: How Users Are Drawn towards Uses of Technology Using the user-led innovation of dishwasher cooking as an example, we explore some shortcomings of the common characterization of technology as something that both constrains and enables human action. While we agree that technology discourages or completely precludes some actions while enabling others, we argue that this characterization says little about how actors arrive at particular uses of technology. In particular, we argue that it fails to do justice to the idea that, over and above merely creating possibilities, technology also actively orients actors towards using it in particular ways. This paper provides an account of this third effect. It does so by outlining a new theory of the affordances of technological objects as a nexus of three types of structures: social structure, actors structures of cognition and action, and the structure of technological objects. We show how this theory allows us to go beyond merely acknowledging the possibility that users devise new uses of technological objects, and to say something about the propensity of different uses to emerge out of the many that may be possible. We develop implications for theorizing the middle ground between technological determinism and voluntarism and discuss ramifications for debates in organizational theory."
2018,"Cooking with the Unfamiliar: Resources for Improvisation This paper investigates the types of resources actors draw from when improvising in the face of unfamiliar settings. Using the empirical context of underground restaurants  episodic dining establishments that occur in a variety of unexpected locations and must regularly improvise to problem solve emergent crises  I draw from ethnographic observations and interviews with organizers to demonstrate that three interlinked resources support improvisation: affective, material, and cognitive. Whereas previous work has focused substantially on the cognitive resources of individual improvisers, the findings presented here contribute to scholarship by highlighting other potentially valuable resources, notably material and affective resources, that actors draw from to improvise. In addition to a stockpile of knowledge and intuition, this paper shows that improvisation also relies on physical means  the raw materials to enable spontaneous action  and the emotional desire, motivations, and understanding to do so. By analyzing effective and ineffective observations of improvisation I find that affective, physical, and cognitive resources are intertwined in action: when one is missing then actors either dont engage in improvisation or the quality of improvisation action suffers. These findings have scholarly implications for better understanding how spontaneous action can occur, and practical implications for how organizations can create supportive improvisational environments."
2018,"How hybrid change agents moderate innovation complementarities Amounting evidence shows how, that is the development and implementation of new organizational practices, processes, and structures, increase firms propensity to develop new and improve existing products and processes. When investigating the initiators of organizational innovation, most research has focused on internal and external change agents at upper echelons neglecting hybrid change agents at lower echelons. We argue that hybrid change agents, because of their unique ability to integrate external and internal knowledge, are particularly important for organizational innovation and may positively influence the technological innovation process. We examine how apprentices in the Swiss VET system, key individuals who integrate external knowledge through school-based education with internal knowledge through on-the-job training, moderate organizational innovations influence on technological innovation. Drawing on a sample of 1,240 firms, we show that apprentices leverage the positive effect of innovations in a firm business processes and organization of work on incremental innovations. We contribute to the literature on complementarities between organizational and technological innovation by revealing how different types of organizational innovation affect technological innovation across the innovation process. Moreover, by revealing the significant role of apprentices, as hybrid change agents at the lower echelons, for a firms innovation activities, we also contribute to the current debate on the salience of VET systems for a knowledge-based economy."
2018,"Optimization: Collective Creative Work in a Big Data Context Based on a comparative ethnography of music production and biocancer research, we examine how big data technology constrains and enables collective creative work. Across settings, we find that actors engage in optimization work to respond to challenges arising from big data. We identify five optimization work practices--curbing, polishing, zooming in and out, annotating, and compiling--that actors use in combination to navigate these challenges. Notably, we shed light on the tedious and non-glamorous nature of collective creative work in big data contexts; contribute to emerging literature on how big data shapes everyday work; and add to best practices of comparative ethnography."
2018,"In or out? Exploring effects of being ranked for high reputation As third-party evaluations like the Fortune 500 or USNWR rankings have become widespread, they have been shown to affect a variety of firm outcomes. As a consequence, a consensus has emerged in the literature that appearing in a ranking measure provides a signal of quality to stakeholders that will eventually benefit the receiving firm. Using signaling theory, we challenge this view, arguing that for high reputation firms, not only the direction, but also the consistency of the signal that comes with appearing in a ranking measure determine organizational outcomes like stakeholder interest. We propose that the inconsistent signals that come with entering and leaving a ranking measure make stakeholders question the quality of high reputation firms, such that not appearing in a ranking measure can provide a more consistent signal of quality, leading to increased stakeholder interest. We test our hypotheses in context of the global field of business schools using a novel data set from the Financial Times Global MBA rankings. Our findings provide broad support for our hypotheses. We conclude that appearing in a ranking measure can have unintended negative consequences for firms, and discuss the implications of our findings for the literature on rankings and reputation."
2018,"How Centralized & Competing Rankings Shape Organizational & Audience Responses in Higher Education Rankings are ubiquitous in contemporary markets, shown to influence audience attention and organizational strategy. But can these responses differ in market environments with centralized vs. competing intermediary evaluations? With rank as a proxy for status, we test rankings structure impacts in three higher education sectors: business, law and undergraduate universities with a longitudinal dataset (1990-2007). Focusing on admissions offer yield rates the proportion of students who accept enrollment offers we find small impacts for short-run changes in rank on yield rates, particularly for elite universities, with less short- run consumer response to competing rankings. In the long run, centralized rankings encourage conformity, but competition between intermediaries disrupts cumulative advantage. Organizational responses to rankings show similar responses to rankings structure, with greater conformity to centralized rankings. These findings extend research on evaluation structure impacts on organizations and audiences, particularly in markets where customers are pre-qualified, and offer insight into status category effects in the top brackets of an organizational field."
2018,"Organizational Status and The Adoption Of New Norm-deviant Practices: A Theory Of Status Cementati We develop a theory of status cementation by considering the impact of organizations entrenchment in the status hierarchy on norm-deviant practice adoption. We propose that status mobility- and age-related processes affect cementation of organizations in the status hierarchy and elaborate on their underlying mechanisms. We argue that organizations whose status positions are uncemented are less likely to conform to the patterns of status-based behavior prevalent at their level of the status hierarchy. In particular, uncemented high- and low-status organizations are less likely to adopt new norm-deviant practices that threaten organizational legitimacy than cemented organizations of equal status. As a result, the U-shaped relationship between status and adoption is less pronounced for organizations that are less entrenched in their status positions."
2018,"Consequences of Positional Inconsistency across Multiple Status Hierarchies in Hollywood In this study I offer a theoretical basis for conceptualizing multiple status hierarchies and examine how actors react to the inconsistency across their status positions in multiple hierarchies. Viewing status hierarchies as stemming from the intersubjective agreement in a field about what is valued, I argue that pluralistic value systems create multiple status conferral mechanisms in different hierarchies and accord unequal status to the hierarchies themselves. Revisiting the sociological literature on status inconsistency, I suggest that actors status positions and their status inconsistency within and across hierarchies will affect their likelihood of engaging in activities aimed at boosting their lagging status. I consider actors embeddedness as a contextual factor that constrains behavioral reactions to status inconsistency and facilitates cognitive adjustment to status quo. Using the artistic and commercial status of the Hollywood actors/actresses, I found that status inconsistency leads them to choose films that could potentially raise their lagging status. Moreover, while high-status performers were in general likely to stick to their routines, they were also more reactive to status inconsistency. Also, embeddedness limited their choice of films."
2018,"Chasing two rabbits: Managing paradoxes in social enterprises as hybrid organizations Based on an inductive multiple case study of five social enterprises, the authors examine what kinds of paradoxes emerge in social enterprises and how they cope with those paradoxes. The authors assume in this study that, regarding social enterprises hybridity as a combination of divergent institutional logics, social enterprises experience extensive conflict due to their logic multiplicity, with low compatibility and high centrality. The analysis empirically confirms four types of paradoxes: paradoxes of performing, organizing, belonging, and learning. Further, the authors reveal that social enterprises employ various approaches to address each type of paradox, thereby sustaining their organizational hybridity. These findings theoretically contribute to research on social enterprises as hybrid organizations, logic multiplicity, and paradoxes in organizations. This study also provides social entrepreneurs a guideline to handle the paradoxical tensions that emerge in their organizations."
2018,"Paradox Work: How Frontline Employees Respond to Paradoxical Situations by Transforming Tensions Paradox scholars are increasingly interested in how paradoxes play out in management practice, in particular how organizational actors experience and respond to them. We add to this literature by exploring the role of situational context and resources for employees responses to paradoxical situations We introduce the novel concept of paradox work which stresses that paradoxes are socially constructed in and through practices and that organizational actors transform paradoxes through their work (i.e. efforts). To capture actors responses to everyday paradoxical situations in organizations, we empirically study frontline employees. Our ethnographic analysis of customer service interactions allows us to identify three practices through which employees respond to paradoxical tensions. Through each of these practices actors constructed paradoxical tensions differently drawing on various situational resources to transform the tensions and get their job done. We contribute to paradox research, firstly, by outlining the practices how organizational actors interpret and use situational resources to transform paradoxical tensions. Secondly, by introducing the concept of paradox work, we provide an impetus for studies that focus on practices and on the interplay between organizational actors and situational resources that constitutes the real-world experience of paradoxical tensions."
2018,"Capturing complex realities: A systems perspective on paradox Paradox research contributes important insight into organizational tensions and their management. Paradox studies generally address a single tension at one level of analysis. Increasingly organizations confront system issues that create numerous tensions across multiple levels of analysis, such as the challenges linked to sustainability. Addressing such wicked problems requires a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying tensions to propose suitable managerial approaches. However, the paradox literature tends to blur experienced tensions (the epistemological realm) and real tensions (the ontological realm), impeding a shift to more complex approaches. We propose a systems perspective on paradox that helps to distinguish experienced tensions from real tensions, which are grounded in systems. Uncovering real tensions makes them empirically interpretable and allows capturing more of paradoxes real-life complexity. Our insights lead to two new approaches to paradox that help organizations manage systems tensions."
2018,"The Nature of Organizational Paradox: A View From Quantum Theory Research on organizational paradox has been burgeoning over the last two decades. While there is a growing consensus on the definition of organizational paradox as contradictory yet interdependent demands that appear simultaneously and persist over time, there is ongoing debate on the nature of organizational paradox, in particular with regard to the latency, salience, and persistence of organizational paradox. In this paper, we develop a conceptual analogy to quantum theory to gain new insights into these three fundamental aspects of organizational paradox. We draw analogies to the quantum principles of superposition, measurement, and entanglement to gain a better understanding of the nature of paradox with regard to latency, salience, and persistence, respectively. We develop a framework that elicits that latency, salience, and persistence constitute a dynamic interplay and clarify the role of social construction, contextual factors, and organizational settings for conceptualizing the nature of organizational paradox."
2018,"Separating Effects of Educational Credentials From Cohort Composition on Artistic Achievement Although much is known about the effects of human and social capital on individuals career outcomes, we know less about whether a person receives separate payoffs from obtaining specialized educational credentials and from the composition of her/his educational cohort. While credentials represent an indicator of one's early human capital, a cohort composition reflects a context for the development of an individual's early social capital. We also dont know how these effects vary among individuals with different status characteristics. This matters because the typical aggregation of data assumes away the time path between education and the corresponding career rewards as well as differences in this time path among high and low status groups. In this paper, we contrast how cohort composition in a graduate school affects career achievement of males and females. Our sample is a group of Korean artists whose careers we track from 2000 to 2015. We find that the number of males in a graduate cohort has a positive effect on the females subsequent career achievement. We also demonstrate that cohort membership effects depreciate slower for females than the effects of their educational degrees. These effects are in sharp contrast with the career paths of males, as expected from the different statuses of the two genders in the art market. That is, the number of females in the graduate cohort has a negative effect on the males subsequent career achievement, and the cohort membership effects depreciate faster for males than the effects of their educational degrees."
2018,"Inter-Cohort Mobility Dynamics in a Deregulated Industry: Social Resources & Status Inconsistency The paper examines the dynamics of personnel flows from incumbents to entrants after a break in industry regulation. We argue and observe that the time-varying network of personnel mobility between incumbent firms forms a status hierarchy, which we find is split in three discrete groups: high-, middle-, and low-status firms. The network and hierarchy indicate how technical knowledge and social resources are distributed among the firms. Our measure of incumbent status, which is exogenous to new firm entry and performance, is updated over time as the network of mobility among incumbent firms evolves. We hypothesize, consistent with the literature, that entrants are attracted to employees from higher status incumbents. We test two contrasting propositions regarding how ex-incumbent employees social resources and status dissonance affect the growth of their new entrant employer. Our analysis uses data on the foreign exchange trading among commercial banks from 1973, when the Bretton Woods agreement regulating foreign exchange trading was abrogated, to 1993. We find that middle status hires have a more positive impact on entrant expansion than hires from high or low status incumbent firms and that faster growing entrants increase their stocks of employees from the middle status incumbents more than from the high or low status incumbents."
2018,"My colleague just left! How the mobility of co-workers affects job performance How is the performance of a worker affected by the departure of a colleague? In this theory paper, we address this question by introducing the concept of an informal opportunity structure, which refers to interpersonal relationships that provide or prevent access to potentially valuable resources within the workplace. We propose that a co-workers departure changes the informal opportunity structure for a remaining focal worker, but that the implications of such changes will depend on the nature of the relationship between them: the focal workers performance will be negatively impacted if their relationship is collaborative, but positively impacted if their relationship is competitive. Furthermore, we argue that the magnitude of these effects will depend on the distance between the two workers created by the move, as well as the dependence of the focal worker on the departing worker. Our theoretical model contributes to research on career interdependence by advancing understanding of the effects of co-worker mobility beyond its impact on formal job opportunities, as well as by illuminating the micro- foundations underlying aggregate associations between turnover and performance."
2018,"Getting Ahead by Staying Put? Specialization and Social Capital in U.S. Civil Service Careers Is it better to be a specialist or a generalist over ones career? Specialization has historically been identified as a successful strategy in human capital enhancement and job signaling. However, recent evidence suggests generalists may be reaping greater economic rewards than expected, due to both skill complementarities with specialists and through increased social capital. This empirical paper compares and tests theories of specialist advantage from labor economic, management, and sociological perspectives using a comprehensive administrative data set on the careers of U.S. federal civil servants over a 22-year period. While specialization is indeed a successful strategy for some employees, career generalism confers benefits on other employees, particularly in settings where specialists outnumber generalists. Furthermore, coherent generalist careers, comprised of diverse experiences confined to a single broad occupational field, are more advantageous than just specializing in a single niche within an occupational area. Atypical careers are also shown benefit employees, though the return to atypicality is substantially reduced if it renders employees incomparable with their local peers. The paper concludes with general observations about the changing nature of employment and proposes future directions for research."
2018,"Making Sense of Sensemaking Process in the Face of Different Types of Organizational Environment Modern organization theory suggests that external environment is central to the organizational phenomena. Similarly, since its prologue by Karl Weick, sensemaking has been widely used to describe organizational actors and processes. Despite this significance of both constructs and their suggested interwoven occurrence in organizational landscape, sensemaking processes in the face of different types of organizational environments have not been studied. The present article makes two contributions in this regard. It furnishes a framework to describe which form of sensemaking is useful in given organizational environment. In doing so, it also attempts to bridge the gap between two strands of sensemaking research  one that tend to use sensemaking framework for describing organizational phenomenon, and the other which is adding new constructs, especially related to temporal and ontological dimensions, in sensemaking research. Propositions have been furnished for future research in this area."
2018,"Deinstitutionalizing a Dominant Logic: The Emotional Side of Sensemaking and Sensegiving Institutional theory has recently begun to explore the emotional side of agency, particularly in processes of deinstitutionalization. This paper brings a sensegiving and sensemaking perspective to these concepts, asserting that institutions comprise both cognitive and emotional content, and that sensegivers deploy institutional elements strategically to shape their targets emotional investment in change projects. The study presented here uses empirical data to theorize how the emotional components of institutional elements might be deployed as part of the actors toolkit. Agentic actors creative use of institutions to affect the emotional intensity of a sensemaking field are illustrated within the context of a qualitative case study examining discourse around sustainable seafood between industry actors and environmental non-governmental organizations (ENGOs). These findings extend existing theorization of how institutions and sensemaking interact to show first, that these effects exist on an emotional plane as well as a cognitive one, and second, that organizational actors do not merely encounter these catalysts, they deploy institutions strategically in their sensegiving efforts to bring about institutional change."
2018,"Curating the past and the struggle for authenticity of Canadian whisky producers While authenticity is often treated as inhering in people or objects, it is a socio-symbolic accomplishment, requiring authenticity work. Some organizational scholars have begun to study the use of historical discourses in authenticity work, but the historical narratives have tended to be treated as readily accessible and available for activation, as needed. In contrast, we argue that such authenticity work consists of constructing history in a manner that endows the historical narratives with moral and emotional force that enables a shared sense of goodness and virtue between organizations and key audiences. We report the results of an inductive study of the Canadian whisky industry, which investigated the challenges associated with recreating Canadian whisky tradition after decades of neglect. We also report how distilleries and Canadian whisky advocates curate the past in attempts to challenge solidified perceptions of the category and of individual organizations. Our findings reveal two facets of curating work: restorative facet involves attempts to faithfully adhere to the material practices that have been utilized in the past; reimaginative facet involves the faithfulness to the past but eroded ideals and values through reinvention of material practices. The manuscript advances the performative view of authenticity and contributes to the literature on strategic use of the past."
2018,"Attention as a Local Performance: Towards a Practice-based View of Attention in Organizations Managerial attention has often been conceived as a scare resource, which direction is shaped by the environment and the firms procedural and communication channels. In this paper, we leverage insights from research on situated cognition and practices studies to offer a new conceptualization of attention as a local performance. This conceptualization emerges from our empirical study of managerial work in the call center of a large European electricity company. We show that operational managers pay attention to their coworkers and the firm operational objectives through three types of adverting practices  sensory-awakening, remembering and propagating , which involve the body and the socio-material features of the local environment. Overall, our analysis suggests that attentional processing is a performance since it shows that paying attention to something is a type of work associated to socio-material and embodied practices. In addition it suggests that this performance is local, since attention is always situated and takes place during attentional episodes. In conceptualizing managerial attention as a local performance, we contribute to the attention-based view by showing that attentional processing is not just structurally determined, but also implies agency (through adverting practices). We also contribute to the literature on the qualities of attention and the managerial work behaviour literature by showing that managers can extend their attentional abilities by mobilizing the socio-material features of their environment. In this way, our study reveals a degree of proactivity in their daily work rather overlooked so far."
2018,"Containing Stigma Spillover: The Effectiveness of the Scapegoating Strategy Prior research in stigma management focused on the organizations bearing stigma while overlooking the categorical stigma that might require different managing strategies. This paper examines the effectiveness of an understudied stigma management strategy at the categorical level, scapegoating, used by intermediaries. Study 1 explores a puzzling case of the 2008 Chinese melamine scandal, in which the Chinese government adopted the scapegoating strategy but failed to contain the stigma spillover. A scenario-based experiment in Study 2 shows that the relative effectiveness of scapegoating depends upon two factors: (a) the prior reputation of the scapegoated; and (b) the identity of the intermediary conducting the scapegoating. Implications and directions for future research are discussed at the end of this paper."
2018,"From Outcast to Game Change: The Re-Invention and De-Stigmatization of Australian Wine Theorizing core-stigmatization as a form of status, situatedbelow the legitimacy threshold, we address de-stigmatization and status elevation of an entire market category as a staged process involving five interrelated mechanisms: Reducing Attention, Highbrow Self- Invention, Middlebrow Self-Invention, Boundary Work and Endorsement Work. Our study is based on the analysis of archival material supplemented by primary data of interviews and field visits in the Australian wine industry. By introducing status work as an agentic endeavor to redefine thesocial meaning of a category, its boundaries, and, thus, its status position, we contribute to the literatures on stigma, status and categorization from a social symbolic work perspective."
2018,"Historically Oppressed Groups Entering Established Economic Fields In this study, I address how historically oppressed groups can enter established economic fields. Drawing from the literature on fields and stigma, I investigate how First Nations in Canada entered the Canadian gambling field. I show that historically oppressed groups can enter established economic fields by resourcing stigma, and specify how resourcing stigma affects field-level coopetition dynamics and entry outcomes. In particular, the mechanisms of resourcing stigma include 1) Transforming stigma into the source of power and legitimacy for field entry; 2) Collecting resources based on stigma; 3) Strengthening legitimacy and competitiveness based on stigma. These mechanisms differentially affected the contention with field incumbents and the joint tasks and concessions that directly paved the way for field entry. I show the mechanisms of resourcing stigma and the linkages between mechanisms of resourcing stigma, coopetition, and entry outcomes in a process model, and discuss the contributions to the field and stigma literature."
2018,"Responsiveness to Status Change and Corporate Acquisitions Status research recently takes agentic and behavioral approaches to explore status dynamics of social actors, and we expand this research by unpacking mechanisms that drive organizations responsiveness to status change. Two factors are considered to influence varying degrees of status responsiveness. First, we conjecture that accumulated status (i.e., current status position) can inhibit saliency of status loss when high status position was attained historically. Second, stigmatizing events can be effective in intensifying responsiveness to status loss because of the events being highly attributable to status loss. We tested the effects of business groups ranking and its change in South Korea between 2001 and 2016. Our results suggest that although high status business groups have higher propensity to make acquisitions than lower status business groups in general, they are less likely to respond to status loss by making acquisitions. This study also finds that more stigmatizing events (e.g., bankruptcy of subsidiaries) strengthen the responsiveness to status loss whereas less stigmatizing events (e.g., breakaway of subsidiaries) weaken the responsiveness."
2018,"Bullish or Foolish? Collective Expectations and Diversification in the Venture Capital Industry We examine how collective expectations affect firm diversification behavior in the U.S. venture capital (VC) industry. Departing from prior accounts that focus on potential benefits and costs of diversification, we theorize how elevated collective expectationssignaled by trends in the broader environment, such as initial public offering (IPO) activitiesencourage firms to venture into new industries, resulting in higher levels of diversification. However, not all firms are equally likely to diversify during a boom. We predict why some firms are more susceptible than others based on two theoretical approaches to social influence. The rational-actor account suggests that a firms tendency to diversify during the boom will be contained by its experience; whereas the embedded-actor account suggests that this tendency is moderated by a firms immediate network and the local community. We further posit that a firms diversification behavior during the boom will lead to a subsequent worse performance. We test these predictions with all U.S.-based VC investments from 1990 to 2016. Results support our arguments that firms tend to diversify during a boom and that doing so has negative performance implications. Moreover, our findings lend stronger support for the embedded-actor account compared to the rational-actor account."
2018,"A Safety Valve: Hierarchical Similarity and Diversification in Family-Controlled Firms We propose a novel structural explanation of unrelated diversification in corporations. When the dominant coalition consists of leaders of similar hierarchical ranks, there can be tension between these powerful individuals. Such tension can result in unrelated diversification, as the relatively independent business terrains allow the corporate elite to exert their influence separately. We test this argument in the context of family-controlled publicly listed firms in China, where the dominant coalition and hierarchical similarity can be clearly identified. Results show a strong positive relationship between hierarchical similarity in the controlling family and unrelated corporate diversification, and such a relationship is further strengthened when the chair is female, firm performance is poor, or family corporate elites involved are not from a single nuclear family. This study contributes to research on diversification by discovering an underexplored source of structural tension, and extends research on organizational hierarchy by establishing an important strategic consequence of lack of clear hierarchy."
2018,"Performance of diversified business group affiliated firms in India: An Agency view In this paper, we study how the heterogeneity among business groups (BGs) creates principal-agent and principal-principal type agency problems and negatively influences the performance of BG affiliated firms in emerging economies. Drawing upon learning theory, we argue that internationalization reduces some of these agency issues and brings certain advantages to emerging economy diversified BGs as internationalization complements their domestic competitive advantage. In addition, we argue that positive stewardship arising from high promoter block holdings works in favor of emerging economy diversified BG affiliated firms to improve their performance. Our arguments find empirical support in a sample of 828 Indian BGs affiliated and stand-alone firms, over the period from 2005-2014."
2018,"Who Takes on the Small Producers? The Role of Emergent Portfolio Dynamics In this paper, I combine insights from economic and valuation-based theories to examine the factors of niche product representation and portfolio expansion. Building on the premise that different theories might have different explanatory potential on different levels of analysis, I outline expectations based on economies of scale, value homophily, and the lived experience of industry participants. I use the empirical case of beer wholesaling, a reactionary industry segment, in which firms were reacting to the changing conditions in beer production. The change entailed the emergence of a niche market segment, the increased market entry of small-scale producers. I conduct two analyses using a proprietary dataset. First, I analyze what accounts for a wholesalers decision to add any craft producers to its portfolio. Second, I answer what accounts for a portfolio with a wider variety of craft brands. I find that it is the firms with high sales values that have a higher likelihood of representing any craft labels; value homophily matters less. Moreover, there is a local logic to the composition of beer labels in a given portfolio, and this fit positively affects both craft representation and portfolio diversity. Finally, while good renegade labels hinder access to portfolios of latecomer producers in most areas, they facilitate portfolio diversity in highly competitive environments. The discussion explores the generalizability of the good renegade concept and its connections to organizational inequality. This paper calls for extending current research frameworks in economic sociology that allow studying firm behavior using both economic and sociological lenses."
2018,"The status discount: Untangling the role of status in performance evaluation This paper highlights a status discount in the performance evaluation process. Most status studies emphasize that high status enables actors to perform well, but overlook that status may also heighten audience expectations that become harder to meet. This study shifts attention from how status affects performance and the perception of performance to the role of status after performance is unambiguously observed. In particular, we propose that high-status actors receive less credit for their performances because audiences have established high expectations of them. While low-status actors are less likely to perform well, they receive more rewards once they succeed. Moreover, while prior literature emphasizes the value of relational endorsement, we argue that collaborating with prestigious peers may raise audience expectations, which downgrades the appealingness of their collaborative performance. We test our hypotheses in a sample of NBA players and find broad support."
2018,"Catching the Big Fish: The Role of Scandals in Making Status a Liability This study focuses on how scandals shape the effects of social status in the context of organizational misconduct. We argue specifically that status is more likely to be a liability than an asset when misconduct is part of a more widespread scandal. Scandal reduces the uncertainty surrounding misconduct by increasing the likelihood that questionable acts are categorized as misconduct, increasing the deterrence value of punishing high-status organizations, and reducing the costs of enforcement action against high-status organizations. High-status organizations are therefore more likely to become targets of enforcement action when their misconduct is part of a scandal than when their misconduct is not part of a scandal. Focusing empirically on Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) enforcement actions, we found that status in itself neither protects nor exposes organizations to SEC enforcement actions but that status increases the likelihood of SEC enforcement action when misconduct is part of a wider scandal."
2018,"Perception of Firm Status and Organizational Ambidexterity While research on antecedents of organizational ambidexterity is voluminous, very little attention has been paid to the impact that managerial cognition has on ambidexterity. In the current study, we investigate the impact of managers perception of own organizational status on the ambidexterity and its boundary conditions. We argue that managers perceiving high organizational status will be more risk-taking and involved in more divergent thinking, and consequently pursue more exploration. In contrast, managers perceiving low organizational status will be risk-aversive and more engaged in convergent thinking, making exploitation more likely. We further identify a set of internal and external contingencies derived from the managerial discretion perspective that might affect the effects of status perceptions. A careful analysis based on a unique two-wave survey dataset of about 500 Chinese firms generally supports our predictions. Our study contributes significantly to research on organizational ambidexterity and status."
2018,"The Many Faces of Status: Audience Segmentation and Competing Effects on Pricing Different research traditions have proposed three distinct mechanisms in explaining the influence of status of a market intermediary on price formation  certification, Matthew effect and cognitive authority  though there has been little prior effort to disentangle those mechanisms conceptually or empirically. Focusing on the relationship between lead underwriter status and U.S. equity IPO underpricing, the present study argues that these mechanisms have countervailing effects operating via different audiences  respectively the buyers (institutional and retail investors), the intermediarys peers (other investment banks) and the sellers (issuers). We then empirically identify these effects using directed acyclic graphs (DAG) reasoning and structural equation modeling of the U.S. equity IPOs from 1986 to 2010. Our key contribution is integrating the various status-related mechanisms into a single framework, and in the process resolving long-standing mixed results of financial economists about the relationship between underwriter status and IPO underpricing."
2018,"Status Advantage and Employment-related CSR: Evidence from a Regression Discontinuity Design This paper aims to examine the causal effect of organizational status on labor market advantages. We exploit a plausibly exogenous change in organizational status by implementing a regression discontinuity design in a prominent ranking of companies. Our analysis show companies that just make it into the high-status category have significantly lower net scores in terms of employment-related CSR. The effect is also substantively significant as gaining status decreases a companys net score in employment CSR by 0.383, a considerably large magnitude that constitutes about half of the average of the net scores of employment-related CSR in the whole sample. In addition to establishing empirical evidence for the labor market advantage of status, our finding also contributes to the growing literature that studies CSR as a lever for human resource management."
2018,"Value of Friendship: Instrumental and Sentimental Motivations for Executive's Networking Behavior Research on corporate executives social networks has primarily focused on the consequences of interpersonal ties between corporate executives. Relatively little attention has been paid to the motivation of executives in forming and retaining interpersonal ties. Drawing on social exchange theory, we argue that corporate executives have both instrumental and sentimental dimensions of networking motivations in building and retaining friendship and advice ties with other executives. Our results show that higher (lower) distance along instrumental (sentimental) motivations of networking between executives increases the likelihood of friendship seeking tie since corporate executives evaluate different dimensions of benefits from interpersonal ties. Furthermore, our findings show that corporate executives seek advice from more competent executives, conditional on the executive being a friend. Over time, the sentimental dimension of motivation loses influence on friendship tie but the instrumental dimension of motivation continues to impact corporate executives networking behavior. Our empirical study utilizing social network data among Korean corporate executives from 2 time periods provides strong support for our theoretical contribution."
2018,"Gender and the Give and Take of Emotions in the Workplace This paper focuses on the role of gender in shaping emotional expressions and alignmentthe tendency for people to match the emotional expressions of their conversation partners in language-based communicationat work. People have natural tendencies to express emotions and tend to sort into conversation with others who have similar propensities. To varying degrees, people also actively adjust their emotional expressions to align with those of their conversation partner. The latter, I argue, is a form of emotion work. I develop a theoretical account that helps to reconcile two competing expectations about gender and emotional expressions. On one hand, men are socialized to contain their emotions, whereas women are socialized to express emotions. On the other hand, women in the workplace often suffer greater penalties and backlash than men when they express emotions. I propose that the tendency for men and women to express emotions depends on the valence of the emotion being expressed: men have greater license to express negative emotions, while women are licensed to express positive emotions. I further argue that women face more diffuse emotional obligations than men, making women more likely than men to adapt their tendencies to align to their colleagues emotions. I test these ideas using the content of 425,649 one-to- one email message threads exchanged over six years among 710 full-time employees at a mid-sized technology firm. To account for selection of individuals into conversations on the basis of similarity in emotional expression tendencies, I employ a word-based hierarchical alignment model that distinguishes base rates of word usage from alignment in response to others' language use. Overall, people express six times more positive than negative emotion in the workplace. Men are 16.0% more likely to express negative emotions, whereas women are 11.4% more likely to express positive emotions. Women align more to negative emotions than men. However, both men and women align to a similar extent towards their colleagues positive emotional expressions. I discuss the implications of these findings for research on emotions, gender, and workplace inequality."
2018,"Towards Advancing Well-being in Organizations: An Examination of Happiness underlying Overwork Happiness is a mans greatest achievement (Fromm, 2013), and a happy life is the life preferred by individuals (Diener, Suh, Smith, & Shao, 1995). Organizational scholars show that work can serve as a source of general happiness (Judge & Kammeyer-Mueller, 2011). This study concerns the relationship between affective happiness and heavy work investment (HWI) - a phenomenon which is reflected by investment of long hours and effort in working. Precisely, this study examines levels of positive and negative affect in four different types of heavy work investors (HWIs) in comparison to moderate workers, according to Snir & Harpazs model (2015). No research to date has attempted to investigate the characteristics of the happiest workers according to this theoretical model. The general sample comprised of 404 workers. The study demonstrates that HWIs report higher levels of affective happiness than moderate workers. The results imply of the characteristic of the happiest worker examining dispositional HWIs, situational HWIs and their subtypes (workaholics, passionate HWIs, organizational HWIs, and, economically oriented) in comparison to moderate workers. The findings of this research have practical implications to increase employees' well- being, and help organizations outcomes, since positive affect leads to successful outcomes (Lyubomirsky, King & Diener, 2005)."
2018,"True Play and Hard Work Based on an ethnographic field study, we examine how work and play coexist in a high tech organization. We found that play was spatially and temporally interlaced with intense work. Apart from the diversionary and serious play already studied by organizational scholars, we also found a new type of play not presently documented in work organizations and which we call true play because of its strong resemblance to the play described in anthropology (Huizinga, 1955). True play is intense and absorbing, volitional, visible, collective, not related to the task in hand and enjoyable. We also identify the mechanisms that enable people to move between work and play: the meaning of true play for employees, similarities between work and play, and constant calculations about work results. These mechanisms provide an explanation of the way work gets accomplished in a play-intensive organization. Our study enriches our understanding of the nature of work and play, contributes to control theories, and extends anthropological theories of play."
2018,"An Organizational Perspective on Constructing Novel Risks: The Case of Bisphenol A Through an inductive, qualitative study of organizations experiences with the chemical bisphenol A, we develop a model of how novel risks are constructed. Novel risks represent a break with the past and are characterized by uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity. As a result, prevailing technical, rational-analytic risk assessment techniques are limited in their ability to establish their existence. Our findings illustrate how novel risks are constructed within a dominant discourse of risk through a process involving risk translation whereby organizations translate an objects equivocal meaning in relation to risk into more familiar risks that provide them with a clearer basis and guide for action. As multiple organizations take risk management actions to address these translated risks, an ecology of risk emerges. A novel risk is constructed as this ecology of risk expands to include more and more organizations whose actions combine synergistically in problematizing the prevailing body of risk knowledge and the object directly."
2018,"Discourses of professionalism in front-line service work:insights from a case study in a bank The article draws on the literature on the triangular employment relation in the service industry, as well as on the debate on contemporary forms of professionalism, to explore the varied uses of the discourse of professionalism in a banking company. Methodologically, it is a single-case study based on 61 semi-structured interviews, company documents and observational data. The research results show how, in the company studied, the notion of professionalism was used both by individual employees and, at the collective level, by union organizations to advance front-line employees and customers interests vis--vis the management. Moreover, rather than a single discourse, several discourses of professionalism coexisted, and were subject to constant debate and contestation. The article provides a bridge between two streams of literature which to date have barely talked to each other. It thus advances the understanding of both contemporary forms of service work and professionalism."
2018,"How a CEOs Use of Language toward Shareholders and Stakeholders Affects CEO Dismissal Top managers routinely use language in public to signal messages to the firms constituencies in the environment, but little is known about how temporal variations in the managers use of language affect outcomes. Drawing on signaling theory and a cognitive perspective about corporate governance, we examine how temporal consistency in the CEOs use of language in public documents affects the boards decision to dismiss the CEO. We predict that the effect of temporal consistency in language varies depending on whether the language signals conformity to a prevailing institutional logicshareholder value principle or an alternative institutional logicstakeholder theory. Using CEOs letters to shareholders from large firms in the United States, we found that CEO dismissal risk is lower when CEOs consistently use shareholder-value-friendly language over time and the risk is greater when CEOs consistently use stakeholder-oriented language over time."
2018,"Local Remembering, Global Forgetting: Uses of the Past in Corporate-Community Relations in Kenya Firms engage in the strategic uses of the past, such as making their past wrongdoings forgotten. In this process, firms may face the challenge of interacting with stakeholders who confront their narratives. How do firms and stakeholders conveying contested memories manage to work together in their ongoing relationships? Drawing on a qualitative study of interactions between a multinational beverage corporation and a tea growing community in Kenya, this paper examines how the corporation and the community, despite contested memories, built mutually beneficial partnerships by differentiating local and global narratives. The study sheds light on the relational and spatial dynamics in the strategic uses of the past by theorizing that actors can continue to disagree, yet work together, by producing distinct historical narratives across spaces."
2018,"Post-Bureaucracy in Practice: Fusing Firm-Level Collaborative Organizing and Formal Authority Collaboratively organizing, leaderless companies have been envisioned by postbureaucracy theorists for decades. However, there is little understanding of how such organizing could ultimately work for real-life firms with inherent power asymmetries. Utilizing interviews, archival data, and participant observation, we examined the organizing practices of three exceptional Nordic software services firms that had replaced managerial control with fully autonomous employees. Their employees engaged in collaboration- based decision-making and coordination on both operative and strategic matters. We conclude that the absence of centralized structures was balanced by explicit efforts to cultivate individual empowerment and sense of community. Moreover, the collaborative model symbiotically embedded leaders with formal authority: they served as backers of employees right to self-determination and held the potential to intervene in (unlikely) abuses of that right. Our study contributes by detailing practices of post- bureaucratic organizing (which we label fluid coordination, emergent direction, community cultivation, and context and culture curation), explicating their self- reinforcing nature, and by challenging the perceived limits of fusing collaborative and hierarchical logic in firm organization."
2018,"Hierarchies, Polyarchies and Hybrids: How Organizational Structures Determine Economic Performance The mutual interdependencies between organizational architectures, decision-making processes and corporate performance were investigated by applying agency-based Monte-Carlo simulations in combination with cellular automata. Three organizational architectures (hierarchical, polyarchical and hybrid structures) were modelled using three different initial project portfolios containing different risks including collective myopia and organizational inertia. In risky environments, rigid hierarchies achieved a much higher average performance even when the decision quality of the managers was poor. However decentralized structures accept more projects because of fewer omission errors and indeed the average performance of hybrid structures was generally found to be between the performance of hierarchies and polyarchies. Subtle systematic interdependencies were found to exist between project selection on the individual level, organizational structures and corporate performance, namely where agents are aware and able to evaluate the quality of projects, then hybrids were found to be the superior form of organization. On the other hand, hybrid organizations tend to be liable to joint myopia. Results also highlight the dangers involved in erecting organizations tending towards hybrid, because such organizations can readily become over-challenged regarding handling risks adequately. Finally, we discuss how firms could be structured to increase performance and minimize risks."
2018,"The Effect of the Environment on Organizational Failure: A Meta-Analysis The assessment of a firms age and its failure represents a core question of contemporary organisational and managerial survival research. In this paper, we conduct a meta-analysis of 72 empirical studies with a total sample size of more than 772,000 firms. Our results show that younger firms have a higher mortality hazard than older firms. Furthermore, we find country munificence, industry dynamism, and industry complexity to moderate the age-failure relationship. Our results contribute to the literature by supporting the liability of newness and liability of adolescence theories as opposed to the liability of aging theory and by investigating important environmental contingencies. With the progressive establishment of start-ups in recent years, our results are of relevance to practitioners and policy makers as well."
2018,"Keeping goals relevant in multi-actor collaborations This paper explores how organizations from different backgrounds are able to pursue sustained collaboration on a broad goal. Broad goals are effective for mobilizing heterogeneous actors to collaborate on an overarching issue. However, realizing broad goals can be challenging due to the possible emergence of conflicting sub-goals salient to different participants. Prior research has found conflicting sub-goals to have both positive and negative effects on sustained collaboration. Conflicting sub-goals can create synergy and innovative initiatives, but can also lead to inertia and displacement of the broad goal. How do organizations with heterogeneous interests engaged in a collaborative initiative manage the tension between the pursuit of a broad goal and ensure that conflicting sub- goals do not displace the broad goal? To explore this we draw upon a qualitative longitudinal study of Helix Nebula, the leading science and business cloud computing initiative in Europe. We explore how large science organizations (CERN, EMBL, ESA) collaborate with business (Atos, CloudSigma, T-Systems) and public infrastructure organizations (EGI, GANT) on the broad goal of developing a pan-European scientific cloud computing infrastructure. Our inductive analysis derived contextualizing and conceptualizing as two mechanisms that enable organizations to adopt a frame where conflicting sub-goals are perceived as serving rather than undermining sustained collaboration on a broad goal. Our empirical study of Helix Nebula contributes to multi-actor collaboration and framing literatures and has broader implications for science, business, and society by explaining the mechanisms that allow the pursuit of broad goals despite the emergence of conflicting sub-goals that can damage sustained collaboration."
2018,"Staying on course counter to market categories: ProCredit disaffiliates from microfinance This paper explores how organizations steer the institutionalization of core identity elements counter to market categories. The paper identifies, as central to this steering, the building and nurturing of embedded-tie relational systems with core audiences. The paper builds on a case study of the ProCredit Holding, a multinational bank pursuing the institutionalization of elements central to its identity counter to microfinance."
2018,"What Counts as Sustainable? Negotiating Legitimacy in Controversial Market Practices Although much of the literature on moral legitimation focuses on alignment with external norms, less attention has been given to recurring legitimacy contests and to negotiating legitimacy. The paper is a longitudinal qualitative study of how the moral legitimacy of market practices in an emerging regulated market is justified and negotiated through the construction of a coordinating arrangementa fragile composite setup through which disputes were constantly sparked and temporarily resolved. I propose a model of moral legitimation by transcending indeterminacy that extends the process model of building moral legitimacy in situations of moral multiplexity."
2018,"Stressed and shattered: Field-level change and consequences of high complexity in the energy market Whereas most studies on institutional logics and complexity focus on single conflicts in static environments, our study provides a more dynamic and processual understanding, allowing to explore institutional fields with an increasing range of logics and conflicts between them. To capture multiple logics and to analyze their relationship, we applied a longitudinal mixed-methods approach by combining interpretative qualitative methods with big data research strategies. Drawing on the case of Germanys energy market, our study identifies a variety of rising conflicts between seven institutional logics, indicating a situation of escalating complexity during the German Energiewende. Additionally, our findings show a link between the degree of complexity and ensuing organizational responses, indicating a tipping point of complexity after which defy and dismiss strategies against new or conflicting demands became unfeasible and more far-reaching responsesin our case spinning-off, market exit, and radical restructuringremained as the last resort. Our findings provide theoretical and methodological insights for situations of institutional complexity and organizational responses."
2018,"Oscillating between logics: A process view on responding to institutional complexity The institutional literature has given considerable attention to the tensions that arise from multiple institutional logics and how organizations respond. However, this research has tended to consider responses to institutional complexity as static. To overcome the static view, this paper develops a process lens on how organizations respond to institutional complexity both in the moment and over time. We argue that a process view can extend understandings of institutional complexity through attending to the ongoing practical responses of social actors within institutions and organizations by directing our attention to their temporality. Appreciating temporality shifts our focus to the ongoing, unstable and constantly evolving nature of responses to institutional complexity over time. The expanding field of impact investment is selected as an appropriate site to explore the dynamic nature of responses to institutional complexity given its competing impact logic (focused on social welfare, community development and environmental sustainability) and investment logic (focused on delivering commercial financial returns to investors). The paper adopts a longitudinal multiple case study over a five-year period, examining 29 organizations within the Australian impact investment marketplace through 59 in-depth semi-structured interviews with impact investors, foundations, institutional investors, social enterprises and other collaborators connected to three new impact investment funds. Through the process lens we see the dynamic ways in which individuals and organizations cope with complexity: (i) oscillating in the moment and over time; (ii) becoming hybrid; (iii) experiencing shocks. These findings extend process perspectives on institutional complexity by providing empirical insights on how responses to institutional complexity are constantly in motion both within the moment and over time."
2018,"Disagreeing over Goals or Means: Collaborative Contestation in the UK Social Investment Market Contrary to the prior imagery of outright contestation between incumbent and challenger organizations, social movement theory has recently argued that collaboration between the different parties can also drive processes of field- level change. By inquiring about when it is more likely that collaborative mechanisms arise, I argue that variation about whether the conflict is about means or ends is an important factor in how incumbents and challengers will engage with each other. To explore this question, I use the context of a nascent market such as social investment in the UK, where for many years organizations struggled to make sense of, and agree upon, product definitions, industry structure, and legitimate practices. Once the market coalesced around a shared understanding of what social investment was, this triggered contestation from organizations that opposed the mainstream views. Interestingly, when conflict was about the ends of the market itself, challengers would disengage and look for potential alternative markets. When the dispute was about the means, organizations would engage in a process of collaborative contestation. The paper hence contributes to our understanding of nascent market dynamics, and especially to how and when mechanisms that blend collaborative and contending practices can drive the field forward."
2018,"Co-opting Contention: Field-level Effects of Firm-Activist Collaborations In this paper, we explore the mechanisms of indirect co-optation, asking whether and under what circumstances firms that collaborate with activists face less contention from other activists. To shed light on this question, we employ a unique, self-constructed 10-year panel of all contentious and collaborative interactions between 118 environmental social movement organizations and a random sample of 150 of the largest firms in the United States. We find that indirect co-optation of the broader activist field occurs via two pathways: signaling and relational. First, as evidence of signaling, we find that collaborating with a more contentious activist produces more indirect co- optation, as these collaborations provide a stronger signal of the firms authentic support of the movement. Second, as evidence of relational indirect co-optation, we find that firms face less contention from activists that are board-interlocked with the activist with whom the firm collaborates. Our findings demonstrate the importance of considering the influence that firm- activist collaborations have outside the focal dyad in shaping the firms relationship with a broader movement. They also offer a broader view of the indirect effects of interactions between social activists and firms, inclusive of those resulting from cooperative private politics, a heretofore understudied phenomenon."
2018,"Riding the Hype Train: The Corporate Co-optation Process of a Hyped Category Many sharing economy sectors have been founded by social movement organizations, but later co-opted by corporations. The process of co-opting a market category initiated by a social movement is an understudied phenomenon because these movements are usually expected to operate outside industry. Our study contributes to this area by examining how co-optation has occurred in the German carsharing category. We use rich qualitative dataset ranging from 1988 to 2015 that we longitudinally analyze to uncover the co-optation process. We create a four-stage process model charting the roles of the social movement organization, corporations and the media in the co-optation. We contribute to the literature by showing that the social movement organization itself sows the seeds for co-optation in aiming to mainstream a market category and that co-optation is initiated by the media, not the corporations."
2018,"Social protest and cultural factors in the adoption of fur in the global fashion industry This study examines the interplay in markets between social movement activity and internal cultural dynamics using the case of fur in the high-end global fashion industry. The authors consider how the contested nature of fur, coupled with pressures for status distinction and differentiation within the fashion industry, is associated with whether fashion houses adopt fur in their collections from 2001-2010. Four hypotheses are tested using a unique data set based on online and print archives. Hazard models indicate patterns consistent with imitation of high-status fashion houses that use fur, and response to social movement activism based on the status of the targeted houses."
2018,"Personnel and Performance Changes after Lucky and Unlucky Outcomes in the National Football League Luck is an omnipresent factor which influences experiences and outcomes for individuals and organizations. This article analyzes how lucky and unlucky outcomes influence future organizational learning, decision-making and performance. Team statistics and outcomes are analyzed over 769 National Football League seasons for 32 franchises from 1990-2015. Four specific sources of luck are identified and measured: 1) divergence of win outcomes from actual team quality; 2) difficulty of opposition; 3) fumble recovery rates and 4) player injuries. Teams and players have little or no influence over these lucky factors, which nevertheless influence game outcomes, and by extension, the careers of players and coaches. Luck alters game outcomes and in turn significantly influences the retention or firing of coaches and players, which shapes their career incentives and decision- making. In addition to distorting learning, luck can also generate perverse incentives; in this case, encouraging risk aversion and scapegoating. Mistaking noise for signal  and conflating luck with skill  is conducive to poorer future decisions and outcomes. Paradoxically, luck can provide a means of skill-based arbitrage for savvy decision-makers, who learn more effectively from noisy feedback than others who are misled."
2018,"The Two Faces of Conflict in Organizational Learning: Evidence from Pharmaceutical Product Recalls This study investigates whether organizations learn more from small or large failures and under what conditions they learn more or less from failures. Drawing on research on motivation and opportunity to learn from failure, we suggest that organizations learn more from small failures than from large failures. We also predict that learning from failures is weaker as internal conflict increases because internal conflict is more likely to accentuate accountability and dampen the flow and exchange of information and experience. Finally, we predict that learning from failures is stronger when external conflict is high because high external conflict is less likely to emphasize identification of culprits, but instead is more likely to promote the internal cohesion needed for effective learning. We examine these issues in the context of pharmaceutical firms learning from minor versus major recalls of pharmaceutical products, small and large failures respectively, using data on all recalls experienced by pharmaceutical firms that sold pharmaceutical products in the United States over an 11-year period from 2004 to 2014. We find that small failures are more beneficial to learning (measured as a reduction in subsequent recalls) than large failures. Also, we find that the learning effect is weaker as internal conflict increases. On the other hand, the learning effect is stronger when external conflict is high. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our findings. Key words: organizational learning, small failures, large failures, internal conflict, external conflict, pharmaceutical product recalls"
2018,"Replication Errors and Error Robustness: When Positive Complementarities Are Negative Replicating successful solutions to complex problems is an important strategy for organizational growth and performance improvement, but accurate replication is often difficult, if not impossible. In theoretical accounts, small replication errors are often depicted as valuable sources of variation. Empirical research, in contrast, has failed to identify such positive effects. We extend an existing model of replication to also explain when even small replication errors have negative long- run performance effects. We demonstrate that the error robustness of solutions, driven by the presence of complementarities, is the key structural driver: if there are strong positive complementarities, even small replication errors are negative while with less strong or negative complementarities, small errors are positive. We also revisit how complexity and the quality of the replication template moderate these effects. The results of our experiments with an NK performance landscape model have important implications for both theory and practice."
2018,"How Gender-Equity Attitudes Affect Gender Performance Gaps I analyze the relationship between discriminatory societal attitudes and gender performance gaps by combining data on attitude and behavior of contemporary American society with information on background and training of academic scientists employed at top ranked universities across states in the United States. The advantage of these data is that it allows me to test whether the discriminatory variance within a society explains gender performance gaps (i.e. treatment effects). What is more, the data give me the opportunity to model selection processes. I find that in regions with stronger discriminatory societal attitudes gender performance gaps are larger. However, after accounting for differences in selection, I find that the effect of discriminatory social attitudes on gender performance gaps is only marginally significant, indicating that much of the results are explained by selection rather than treatment effects. These findings suggest that discriminatory social attitudes do not fully account for gender performance gaps and distinguishing between selection and treatment effects is important for understanding gender gaps."
2018,"Does the Masculinity of Male CEOs Predict Their Pay and Firm Performance? Management research has paid surprisingly scant attention to whether variability in mens adoption and enactment of masculinity in the workplace advantages men not only over women but over other men. In a substantive departure from the predominant theorizing in gender research in the upper echelons that has focused on comparisons between men and women, our premise is that variability in the extent to which male CEOs express masculinity has important implications for the rewards they receive and the performance of the firms they lead. We examine the masculinity of male CEOs using a video-metric approach using archival data on a sample of CEOs of Fortune 500 companies. We supplement this analysis with data from a vignette-based study. Our findings indicate that while less masculine and highly masculine CEOs are able to secure annual compensation that is more risk- free than the compensation of moderately masculine CEOs, masculinity does not have a direct effect on the firm's operational performance. Moreover, masculinity worked to the detriment of CEOs in female-dominated industries; less masculine CEOs also performed poorly in highly male-dominated environments. Contrary to our expectations, highly masculine CEOs performed at higher levels only when they took over firms that were already high performing."
2018,"Managing from the Floor or the Office: Gender Differences in Managerial Control Gender parity in representation declines precipitously as women rise in managerial ranks of organizations. This decline may be, in part, due to how managers approach daily work. Yet, relatively little research has compared the choices that male and female managers make about how to allocate their time in ordinary but critical work activities. In this study I investigate men and womens managerial practices by asking: are there gender differences in how managers spend their time and supervise employees? What contextual factors shape their choices? I introduce two mechanismstrust levels (degree of confidence in subordinates) derived from manager-subordinate similarity and visibility needs (desire to prove skill mastery) born out of gender-specific stereotypesand posit that these mechanisms could explain gender differences in managerial practices. To address these questions I draw upon interviews, observations, and administrative records measuring practices of individual managers in a 100-store grocery chain. Qualitative analyses surface a tradeoff that managers make in how they manage employees: whether to spend time engaging in direct supervision on the floor or tactical planning in the office. Quantitative analyses of millions of records of computer-logs tracking managers office usage reveal that women engage in more direct supervision over subordinates than do men. Moderation analyses provide evidence that womens tendency to supervise employees directly may be driven relatively more by a lack of trust in subordinates than the desire to disprove stereotypes. Findings integrate insights from literature on gender and control in organizations."
2018,"Venture Like a Woman: The Influence of Gender and Venture Type on Investment Decisions Using data on investor-pitch pairs from the televised pitch competition series Dragons Den (Shark Tank), I explore the impact of gender on investment decision-making. Providing a new lens through which to understand the agents-of-change/cogs-in-the-machine debate within organizational demography literature, I posit that advocating for female entrepreneurs is a costly choice for women, as they risk being seen as engaging in illegitimate favoritism. I suggest that women are more likely to favor women when the cost of doing so is lower, notably when the gender congruence of the task reduces the gender gap in expected future performance. Consistent with this prediction, I find that female investors are more likely than male investors to invest in women-led ventures, but only when the business idea is gender congruent. Women with gender-incongruent businesses do not benefit from pitching to a female rather than a male investor. I discuss the implications of my findings on long-term outcomes for women."
2018,"Learning-by-participating in Decision-making A central tenet of work in the Carnegie School tradition is the notion of learning-by-doing organizations learn over time through feedback. In this paper we argue that the learning-by-doing account overlooks the fact that an organizations decision-making structure is often participatoryi.e., organizational decisions often involve multiple individuals aggregating opinions through a process such as voting. In such contexts, individuals in the organization do not themselves learn-by-doing. Rather, when participating in the decision, they may vote for an alternative that is different from the one eventually selected by the organization. A key consequence of this is that these individual participants do not always receive feedback on their own choices; rather, they receive feedback on the choice made by the organization. We call this learning-by-participating, and we seek to understand the implications of this form of learning by comparing it to learning-by-doing, where an individual in the organization (such as the CEO) makes decisions on her own. Using a computational model of decision- making under uncertainty, we find that learning-by-participating leads to distinct patterns of individual learning that create trade-offs at the individual and organizational-levels. For example, while learning-by-participating is beneficial with respect to organization-level performance, it causes a minority of individuals within the organization to hold overly-optimistic views of low- payoff alternatives. We discuss the implications of our findings for research on learning and information aggregation."
2018,"Navigating Turbulent Waters: Negotiating Access to Learning Opportunities This paper seeks to develop the theory of learning in practice by focusing on how participation in practice  seen as central to learning - is actually accomplished by newcomers as they transition to becoming core members of a community of practice. Departing from previous literature in practice-based studies and situated learning, which takes participation in practice as a given, our paper focuses on the ways in which newcomers negotiate access to participation in practices that are central for learning at a site where such access is not readily available. Our paper draws from a five- month multi-sited ethnography in the maritime industry that focuses on the process of transition from cadets (newcomers) to officers (relative old-timers). Two research sites were used; a maritime training centre, and a merchant shipping vessel. Findings show newcomers engaged in three forms anticipatory performances, body work, spatiotemporal work and relational work, which elicit a positive response from the core members of the community. Consequently, the study finds that proactivity is a way of accomplishing participation in practice. As such it develops a practice-sensitive concept of proactivity as a way of negotiating access to participation."
2018,"Learning from Strategic Activities: A Study of Video Game Development While learning from esperience has been well established for many aspects of a firmss operational activities, it is not clear how this may apply to the firms strategic activities. Learning from strategic activities is likely to be much more challenging because these are undertaken less frequently and can show considerable heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose that firms can benefit from their experience if they break down their broader strategic activities into narrower categories. We apply this to product development activities in the video game industry by breaking these down into replication, adaptation and focus. Our results show that the quality of the firms offerings can improve when its experience is broken down into such specific forms. More generally, we demonstrate that firms can benefit from experience when they make deliberate choices about the more fine-grained categories of strategic activities that they choose to pursue."
2018,"Round Hole, Square Peg? Sustaining Dual Social And Commercial Goals In A Cooperative Bank To examine how hybrid organizations make decisions that enable them to sustain the joint pursuit social and commercial goals, and how these decision-making processes unfold over time as tensions between demands grow stronger, we conduct a longitudinal, inductive study of a European cooperative bank over eight years. Our study first reveals a highly iterative decision- making process in which every proposal subject to decision was heavily negotiated and modified, until the proposal satisfactorily met both social and commercial demands. Second, our study unpacks the mechanism of dual championing, according to which decision-makers were respectively socialized into roles of champions of either the social or commercial goals for which they acted as guardians, and which dictated distinct priorities and behaviors in the decision-making process. Collectively, these champions ensured that all proposals adopted fit both organizational objectives; proposals that did not were rejected. Third, our study stresses the importance of updating the scope of decision-making in hybrid organizations as they evolve over time in order to avoid the risk of mission drift. Overall, our findings advance research on how organizations can pursue multiple goals over time."
2018,"Contingencies to the Value of Partnering - Startup Innovation and Corporate Venture Capital Startups are increasingly turning to the incumbent firms in their industries for venture capital. Yet, our understanding of how corporate investors shape entrepreneurial innovation remains sketchy. Studies examining this question agree that incumbent firms control resources that could be of value to startups but differ on whether these relationships facilitate effective access to them. I add to this research in two ways. First, I examine whether these relationships could also constrain the technologies startups pursue to reveal a tension inherent to these relationships between resource access on the one hand and the transmission of limitations on the other. I examine the mechanisms underlying each of these effects to identify specific aspects of startups innovation outcomes affected by them. Second, I consider how each of these influences is moderated by the type of access startups can get to the incumbent organization. I find that these relationships help startups turn their technologies into products, but that this relies on them having investor representatives with well-developed networks within the incumbent firm. I also find that these relationships limit the technological novelty of startups inventions. This negative effect is amplified if startups interact with the established firms corporate executives but is alleviated if they interact with the established firms scientists/technologists. Through these findings, the study contributes to research on entrepreneurial innovation, interfirm relationships and corporate venture capital"
2018,"Effects Of Second Hand Brokerage On Business Model Innovation And Network Evolution Research on social network theory suggests that a firm can use its structural network position to gain access to external resources that help develop innovation. Although most of the research focuses on main effects of network brokerage in a cooperative network, we further explore the effect ofsecond- hand brokerage in a coopetition network. In a longitudinal study, we show that leveraging direct contacts brokerage in a coopetition network contributes to business model innovation. And, firms development of innovative business models helps them to enrich their competitive position and to increase their centrality in the network. This research extends our knowledge of social network theory and competitive dynamics research, and demonstrates the unique value provided by coopetition."
2018,"Business, Insular Stakeholder Relations, and Conflict When the distribution of rents by a firm is perceived as unfair or illegitimate by its stakeholders, conflict obtains. Gurr (1970) argued that the basic, instigating condition for conflict is discontent arising from the perception of relative deprivation. Studies of the economic drivers of conflict have, however, necessarily focused on structural or objective measures of deprivation such as the presence of resource rents or the societal level of income inequality. I leverage a new dataset to return the focus to the subjective perceptions by stakeholders of the legitimacy of economic rent distribution. My empirical strategy compares the structural characteristics of media-reported stakeholder networks at a local level. Specifically, I compare networks of business initiated discourse and action to the overall media-reported network including political and social actors at a resolution of 0.5 by 0.5 decimal degree cells. Where business networks place greater relative emphasis on the core of a network than the periphery or an in-group faction(s) than out-groups, I argue stakeholders will perceive this variation from the overall structure of political and social relationships as illegitimate triggering a sense of deprivation which fosters conflict. My empirical analysis which controls for a battery of alternative drivers of conflict; uses both media-reported verbal and material conflict directed at business as well as deaths reported within the geographically defined area by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program as dependent variables; and includes fixed effects with standard errors clustered at the cell-level and, in some specifications, a lagged dependent variable, is strongly corroborative. Furthermore, I find that the effect of insular stakeholder relation structures of business on conflict is particularly pronounced during periods of abnormal growth in nighttime luminosity (i.e., rapid economic development). This finding is consistent with the causal argument that stakeholder perceptions of an illegitimate distribution of rents is triggering the ensuing conflict."
2018,"Resourcing Inter-Organizational Networks: A Process View The present paper argues for the importance of a processual view on the resourcing of inter-organizational networks. Many previous works, while elaborating on the potential benefits of networks in terms of resource access, take an organization- or ego-centric perspective. However, little systematic knowledge exists that explains how networks as social systems acquire or even generate the resources needed to enact and sustain this form of organizing. For instance, network structures and practices that enable the governance of and interaction in networks consume resources such as money, personnel and time. Against this background, this conceptual work proposes building blocks of a theoretical framework for understanding network resourcing: (1) sources of network resources, (2) the process of network resourcing on the network level as consisting of four sub-processes, (3) trajectories of network resourcing, (4) the multi-level embeddedness of network resourcing, and (5) related tensions. A process theory of network resourcing clarifies not only important characteristics of resources but also adds to our understanding of how resources help to create and maintain inter-organizational networks from a dynamic resourcing perspective."
2018,"The Impact of Demand-Side Policies on Firms' Balance between Exploration and Exploitation Alliances We examine how public demand-side policy incentives for technologies influence firms balance between exploration and exploitation alliances. Previous studies suggest that firms draw on alliances to balance exploration and exploitation as two distinct forms of technological learning. Unresolved in these studies is how firms balancing within and across modes is affected by formal institutions, such as public policy incentives. We posit that by stimulating firm-internal exploitation, demand-side incentives increase firms ability and incentive to shift their balance between exploration and exploitation alliances toward exploration alliances. In addition, we suggest that the impact of policy incentives on firms alliance portfolio depends on the firms prior level of internal exploitation and exploration. We test our hypotheses drawing on a unique panel data set for 48 firms in the solar photovoltaic industry. Our research contributes a deeper understanding of how a firms environment influences their alliance portfolio and bears important implications for the literature on innovation policy."
2018,"Match Made in Media? The Dual Role of Media in Cluster-Spanning Strategic Alliances This study explores how media contribute to cluster-spanning strategic alliances. For the resolution for non-tie-dependent alliance formation, this study introduces the concept of legitimacy and legitimacy space to strategic alliance network studies. By playing a dual role: 1) reflecting the legitimacy of an organization; and 2) expanding the legitimacy space of the focal organization, media reduce transaction costs (budget and time restrictions for potential alliance partner searching) and the risk of ex-ante (true capability of an organization) and ex-post (future behavior, such as opportunistic behavior) information asymmetry, which cause locally clustered patterns of inter-organizational relationships, in strategic alliance. Medias dual role enhances the possibility that an organization highlighted by media is more likely to be included in the set of potential alliance partners of other firms. These two roles enable disconnected organizations in a strategic alliance network, newly founded organizations, and far-off organizations in an alliance network to form strategic alliances."
2018,"Network imprinting, learning and subsequent alliance tie formation Does the form of a firms initial alliance  dyadic or multipartner  imprint the firm, and so shape the course of its subsequent alliance path? Does this subsequent path strengthen or weaken this imprinting? To examine these questions, we study patterns of alliance formation among firms comprising the German biotechnology industry over its complete history from 1996 to 2015. We find that while firms initial alliances indeed shape their subsequent alliance paths, as firms accumulate alliance experience along these paths, these experiences overwhelm the effect of imprinting from the initial alliance. Notably, the direction of imprinting and subsequent alliance effects for the focal firm depends on whether the firms initial alliance is dyadic (initial suppression reversed by subsequent experience) or multipartner (initial amplification reversed by subsequent experience). Thus, among the firms we study, alliance trajectories are shaped initially by their own initial alliances, but adapt to experience over time. Thus, we emphasize the significance of alliance imprinting and experience for understanding the unique dynamics of dyadic and multipartner alliances."
2018,"Alliances' Governance Choices: Make, Buy, Ally, or Coopt? Scholars commonly think about questions relating to governance and organizational boundaries as if only managers of a unilateral organization make decisions. However, the growing practice of collaboration calls for also taking the collective (here: alliance) perspective and investigating the particularities involved in their choices for satisfying emergent resource needs. Specifically, alliances hybrid governance implies that make differs from classical hierarchical governance. Further, besides make, buy, and ally, alliance partners have an additional option that extant literature has not yet systematically explored: They can add a new partner to the alliance  what we call the coopt option. Drawing on the transaction cost and resource-based perspectives, we develop a theoretical framework for understanding the make/buy/ally/coopt decision in the alliance setting. By doing so, we contribute to the governance literature, providing a theory of alliance governance (mode) choices that builds on and complements the theory on unilateral organizations governance choices. Taking the alliance view, we also complement the alliance literatures dominant focus on the firm and dyad perspectives and lay the basis for future research into how alliances organizational particularities affect partners decisions and alliance dynamics."
2018,"Things Fall Apart: Dynamics of British party identities under the decline of class politics In times of institutional decline, organizations seek to reposition and differentiate their identities. This presents a challenge as such repositioning and differentiation requires systematic, i.e., substantial and sustained, investments on new identity elements under conditions of significant uncertainty brought about by the decline of an institution. The present study investigates how British political parties handled their identity repositioning and differentiation in the face of the decline of an institution of social class politics over the period from 1970 to 2015. Starting from the premise that institutional decline that unfolds over an extended period presents substantively different uncertainties to organizations, our findings show that (a) organizations work with systematic efforts to reposition their identity only in the latter stage of institutional decline, and (b), such organizational efforts, however, are unlikely to yield distinct identities in the absence of an institution to help coordinate organizational actions at the collective level. We draw implications for theories of identity change, institutional theory, and organizational competition."
2018,"The veteran's trap:Structural antecedents and performace consequences of focused market identities We advance the veterans trap as a phenomenon occurring in segmented markets, where audience members praise both commitment and originality. In such markets, a producer who has developed a focused identity through repeated membership claims to a social category faces performance losses not only in reducing her focus - as prior literature has argued - but also in increasing her focus. Avoiding the discounts of diversification does not prevent the producer from being perceived as increasingly worn by audience members, and from experiencing decreasing returns. Our paper explores the structural antecedents and the performance consequences of the veteran's trap, by tracking the discographies of electronic music artists between 1978 and 2013."
2018,"The Inauthenticity in Legitimacy: Identity Trade-Offs in Firms New Market Entry Is being the first entrant in a nascent industry an advantage or a disadvantage? Both institutional theory and population ecology suggest that in a nascent industry an increase in the number of firms legitimize all industry members. However, late entrants may suffer penalties because audiences interpret their late entry as a lack of authenticity associated with low customer commitment. In this paper, we theorize and test how the order of entry shapes firms competitive outcomes. Using an experimental approach, we disentangle two at times countervailing forcesaudiences simultaneous preference for authenticity and legitimacy. We distinguish between core value and symbolic features in products or services, and argue that the penalty for follower firms is likely to arise when the late entrant firms share even the symbolic features of their predecessor. We test our theory with an online experiment using examples of startup companies in the healthcare industry. The results show that a late entrant suffers from lower levels of market selection when it shares both the business model (core value) and the website design (symbolic features) with the first entrant, but this copycat discount is significantly alleviated when the late entrant does not share the first movers symbolic features. However, while direct measures of legitimacy show a strong effect on market selection, we do not find support that this is impacted by density."
2018,"Understanding Perceived Controls and Identifications in Organization We argue that the different perceived organizational controls that underlie identity formation as a member of an organization are related to different identity orientations and identification targets in an organization. We also verify that the identity orientation of employees mediates the relationship between organizational controls and relational or organizational identification. In the results of our survey of full-time Japanese employees in 2017 (N = 1,060), specific employee identity orientations were found to be strengthened through the execution of the organizational control. Additionally, it was confirmed that particular identity orientations influence the identifications in an organization. Further, we find that the individual identities by which employees define themselves in the organization function as important personal antecedents of organizational identification."
2018,"Innovation in experts' work: Adoption and diffusion of tasks communities of expert practice In this paper, we explore the dynamics of expert learning by examining experts adoption of new tasks. We apply a theory of absorptive capacity to expert communities of practice, focusing on how the existing body of expert work is an important antecedent for future patterns of expert learning. We theorize that two dimensions of expert work  the complexity and the breadth of knowledge required  are particularly important aspects of the absorptive capacity of experts, and hypothesize that communities that engage in more complex work and draw on more domains of knowledge will search for, and incorporate, new tasks faster and more thoroughly. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the alignment between the new tasks and the experts existing work is an important predictor of adoption. Using a unique dataset of tasks performed by over 20,000 physicians over 10 years, we find support for the importance of work complexity, but not knowledge breadth, in shaping in the likelihood and speed of adoption. Interestingly, we find that high complexity and broad knowledge can limit how far new tasks diffuse within a community. Discussion focuses on the benefits and future possibilities of studying work as a site of innovation and considering absorptive capacity at the level of work and practice."
2018,"Organizational Consequences of Institutional Compliance: HR Practices and Innovation in Korean Firms Institutional researchers have long recognized that organizations face pressures from institutional environments to adopt certain practices. While much institutional research has focused on the antecedents of adoption and related issues of legitimacy, less research has assessed the material consequences of adopting institutional practices. The issues are important because these practices are often prescribed by prominent institutional actors with manifest intent to solve substantive problems, but extant institutional literature provides reasons to question whether the prescribed practices would actually have their intended effects. The present study addresses this basic question in the context of Korean manufacturing firms who were pressured to adopt a comprehensive set of new HR practices for development of their innovative capabilities. The study also develops theory that identifies the characteristics of practices that are more or less likely to deliver their intended benefits. We propose that the results depend on the normative/historical content of the practices and their ramification on lived experience of internal members. In our empirical context, several market-oriented HR practices were prescribed by prominent institutional actors as apparently rational solutions to problems created by the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. The study shows that the practices had varying effects on innovation, consistent with our theorys predictions."
2018,"Global diffusion and deinstitutionalization of a controversial practice We study the process of international diffusion, global contestation, and local deinstitutionalization of a controversial practice, identifying the mechanisms used by proponents and opponents of the practice across multiple institutional environments and constituents. We draw on international diffusion, deinstitutionalization, and power theory to study the emergence and diffusion of the third-party ownership practice in the soccer industry. We use an inductive case study combining archival and interview data to study the determinants of the international diffusion of the practice, the changes in the power structure in the market as the practice was adopted at a global scale, and finally the contestation and deinstitutionalization process that resulted from the ban of the practice. We find that the opacity of the practice can be a diffusion driver, locally and at the international level, nevertheless as the practice transforms the market structure and allows new actors to gain power, a global contestation is triggered through problematization and emotional resonance by insiders with institutional power positions in the market. This article advances in our understanding of the multilevel governance mechanisms and power dynamics that might support international diffusion but also contestation and eventual deinstitutionalization of a practice."
2018,"The Rejection of Third-Party Certification Schemes in Bean-To-Bar Chocolate We examine why entrepreneurs in the emerging bean-to-bar chocolate market segment fail to adopt socially-oriented certification schemes such as Fair Trade, Rainforest Alliance, and USDA Organic. Despite the widespread acceptance in other domains of third-party certification schemes, which signal firms non-market social and environmental goals, our quantitative data show that their use is negligible among even explicitly socially-oriented bean-to-bar chocolate makers. We find that three beliefs underlie the rejection of certification: the cost of label adoption is too high relative to its efficacy; certifiers enactment of professed values is fundamentally flawed; and many labeling schemes have become commercialized and watered-down. Our qualitative data demonstrate that the very entrepreneurs who reject certification are working to shape their market by engaging in the disruption of the global cacao supply chain, exerting informal influence within their market segment, and building connections directly with customers. Taken together, these results suggest limit conditions to certification schemes with implications for the study of non-governmental market regulation and socially-conscious consumer markets."
2018,"Believe it or not: Dealing with Institutional Complexity given Organizational Preferences In a 24-months long case study we examine the formation of the first Islamic Bank in Germany. We offer three theoretical contributions. First, we show that an organization can be not only institutionally compliant but also committed towards institutional demands. Second, given institutional compliance and commitment, we identify four combinatory mechanisms: clarifying, pulling, pushing, and tolerating. Third, we order these mechanisms into a cascade model along organizational preferences given the criteria of institutional compatibility, commitment and convenience."
2018,"Sustaining institutional complexity: Practice-based mechanisms and cross-level institutional work This study presents an empirical analysis of cross-level mechanisms sustaining institutional complexity. The study draws on the case of a German Accounting Firm confronted with institutional complexity resulting from a severe competition and simultaneous stricter regulation. Thereby, our findings offer three contributions to the literature: First, we identify artefact, rule and identity-based mechanisms sustaining institutional complexity on the practice level. Second, we examine cross-level institutional work and show how constructing compatibility between logics, inscribing it in mechanisms and policing sustain institutional complexity sustain institutional complexity in the long run. Third, we contribute to the literature on practice driven institutionalism by analysing the interplay of cross-level institutional work and practice-based mechanism and by showing that though practice is the locus of complexity, complexity can arise from preconditions in the institutional order independent from actors within the field, organisation and practice level"
2018,"Multi-Dimensional Institutional Complexity, Privatization and Marketization in China What type of individuals and private enterprises win out is a central question of transitology in studies of post-socialist market transition. Drawing on Chinas education and training industry (ETI), this article shows a pattern of transitology that belies existing predictions: a particular model of prototypical private enterprises (underdog organizations) that was founded by marginal entrepreneurs and was most noncompliant with formal regulations and informal norms became dominant. I solve this puzzle by developing the idea of multi-dimensional institutional complexity. For an industry facing such complex environment, there are conflicts of institutional templates in ownership, organizational goal, structure and operation. The state plays an important role in underlying multi-dimensional institutional complexity. Since underdog organizations were least dependent upon the state education system and the state-led teaching profession, they became the pioneers in adopting noncompliant practices. I argue that underdog organizations benefited not only from their noncompliant practices but also from an interaction effect: under multi-dimensional institutional complexity, state regulations against noncompliant practices rarely succeeded and even made these practice more effective. I specify the mechanisms through which underdog organizations outcompeted other models. Consequently, underdog organizations as prototypical private enterprises became the rule-makers and pushed the privatization and marketization from below. My study has important implications for various institutional theories and studies of organizational ambiguity. It also proposes a novel bottom-up trajectory of Chinas private economy and new understanding of the role of the state."
2018,"Investigating New Types of Decoupling: MSP in Law and Corporate Practice The study of decoupling  i.e. the discrepancies between formal policies and actual practices and outcomes  has seen a remarkable revival. Importantly, a distinction between policypractice and meansends decoupling has become widely-used. We argue that the decoupling literature still neglects a key feature of decoupling, namely that it is inherently a multi-level concept. Distinguishing explicitly the macro- (country) and the micro- (organisation) levels, we develop a more fine-grained typology of policypractice and meansends decoupling. We hypothesis that differences in the macro-environment may influence the type and extent of decoupling that prevails in a given country. We test our hypotheses in the context of the adoption of legal minority shareholder protection in four European countries. We go beyond previous studies that have investigated policypractice and means-end decoupling in the same context by using a unique dataset for firm-level corporate governance practices that allows us to investigate the multi-level nature of decoupling more directly. Our findings suggest that that decoupling is context specific and the extent to which policypractice decoupling occurs may depend on a countrys legal style."
2018,"The Millennial Meh: Generation Cohort and Field Change in the Automobile Industry Explanations for field change have privileged the role of exogenous shocks and powerful strategic actors. In contrast, little attention has been paid to non-strategic and unorganized but cohesive societal spheres as a source of change. We focus on the role of generation cohorts as drivers of change, and take as our empirical context the role of Millennials in disrupting the exchange field of the U.S. automobile industry. Our mixed methods approach combines quantitative analysis of a large nationwide survey (N=2,225) with in-depth qualitative analysis including 40 semi-structured interviews. Our quantitative findings show that Millennials do indeed exhibit significantly different driving behavior than earlier generations. Moreover, contrary to conventional wisdom, these differences are not primarily due to socio-demographic factors, but rather to differences in underlying attitudes. Our qualitative findings allow us to identify mechanisms through which cohort attitudes may drive field change as Millennials challenge current norms, act as a conduit for external field and technological change, and question field values. We discuss the role of generation identity and myth, how change created by generation cohorts differs from other disruptive changes, and implications for managers and policy."
2018,"Structural change, knowledge diversity and change satisfaction: A mixed method study This study investigates how subordinate-supervisor knowledge dissimilarity (relational demography perspective) and unit-level knowledge diversity, as resulted from structural change, influence individual job satisfaction after the change. We focus on two dimensions of individual knowledge, namely educational background (explicit knowledge) and organizational tenure (tacit knowledge). We develop hypotheses about the negative impact of dyadic knowledge dissimilarity and positive impact of unit knowledge diversity on change satisfaction. Moreover, we advance the hypothesis that the implementation lag, i.e. the time elapsed from the structural change, moderates the positive relationship between unit knowledge diversity and change satisfaction. Data were collected through mixed methods. Quantitative analyses document that individual job satisfaction after the change is negatively affected by functional background dissimilarity between subordinates and supervisors, and that the positive effect of tenure diversity at the unit level on change satisfaction is stronger when the implementation lag is longer. Our qualitative findings illuminate on how units with higher diversity develop new, high-quality routines and processes over time. Contributions to theory and practice are discussed."
2018,"Administrative Activists: The Role of State Actors in Organizational Change An important barrier to organizational change is that, even when social movements influence the state to change policies, these new policies are often implemented in ways that do not facilitate the achievement of movement goals. In this twenty- month field study of organizational change in education systems in five states within the United States, we observed social movement actors in all of the states influence policy in line with movement goals. However, two states accomplished greater organizational change among schools involved in the education initiative than did the other four states. We demonstrate that administrative activists state administrators who work in partnership with social movement actors and use administrative practices to specify and direct action within ambiguous implementation regimes are critical to the change process. These findings have implications for social movement theorists understanding of organizational change."
2018,"Interplay between Practitioners and Policymakers in the Construction of New Organizational Fields Scholars have highlighted the importance of studying the mechanisms of interplay between key field actors, including practitioners and policymakers, as frequently mentioned initiators of organizational field construction. This paper provides a comprehensive review of prior literature on the topic, and makes a contribution by unpacking the concept of interplay between the two types of actors, identifying who facilitates that type of interaction, how and why (motivations). We develop a theoretical model of interplay including the key activities undertaken by each type of actor, and their motivations, and conclude that interplay is a continuous process involving a variety of interactions between practitioners, policymakers - where field agents enable and facilitate the process. The study acknowledges the main interplay categories for practitioners and policymakers in their attempts to create and alter policies and practices, aiming to co-construct an organizational field. This study contributes theoretical insights to advance institutional theory and provides suggestions for future research."
2018,"Collective Action, Networks, and Critical Mass for Market Formation The heterogeneous distribution of resources tends to reduce collective action problems. In this paper, we examine whether these insights extend to more complex settings of collective action. While perfect substitutability of resources is a fundamental assumption of existing collective action models, many collective causes, particularly those focused on market formation, require resources across distinct actors that are often imperfectly substitutable. We develop a formal model that shows that heterogeneity under conditions of imperfect substitutability actually exacerbates collective action problems. We examine the central mechanisms governing the existence and resolution of collective action dilemmas for complex causes and we identify the conditions under which collective action is more or less challenging. Analyzing the problem in the context of market formation, we explore implications for those settings with heterogeneous social structure. We discuss the implications of our findings for study of collective action dilemmas, mobilization strategies for collective action, and market formation research."
2018,"Social support ties among strategic actors? Tie formation dynamics among nascent entrepreneurs The relationship between entrepreneurs is reduced to one of competition in entrepreneurship research, thanks to the conceptualization of the entrepreneur as a strategic actor. Yet, mutually supportive ties with each other might provide respite from their lonely and daunting journey as entrepreneurs. Using quantitative and qualitative data from ethnographic field work in a Silicon Valley incubator, we sought to understand how tie formation process unfolds among nascent entrepreneurs. Our empirical analysis of the longitudinal data on interaction patterns revealed stark contrast in tie formation patterns across formally defined foci (i.e., camp) that entrepreneurs belonged to. Tie-formation mechanisms endogenous to network structure (i.e., prior ties and transitivity) had a positive (negative) effect on tie occurrence within formally defined boundaries characterized by informal (structured formal) activities. Our qualitative ethnographic findings revealed the mechanisms behind the discrepancy in empirical findings. By functioning as a platform to cultivate personal connections, informal social activities nurtured entrepreneurs role identity as sociable actors. However, the climate of suspicion and distrust in the structured formal meetings suppressed their role identity as sociable actors. Whereas empathy cultivated in informal activities paved the way for instrumental support, explicit pursuit of instrumental gains only distanced peers from one another."
2018,"Interstate Competition and State Regulation Variations in Commercial Drone Industry Regulations vary when diffusing across states. Prior studies explain the variations with intrastate power struggles, but this paper argues that interstate competition to attract enterprises or deter social activists in nascent industries could also motivate the states to modify the restrictions (strictness) enforced and the flexibility (openness) provided by the regulations. When a high proportion of neighbor states enact strict regulations, the states are less likely to enact strict regulations, because the states keep lenient regulations to attract enterprises from neighbor states with stricter regulations and they are less concerned about activists from poorly-regulated states. The similar mechanism also applies to new open form regulations, where the regulation targets get involved in the regulation process. When a high proportion of neighbor states enact less open regulations, the states are more likely to enact open regulations, which is caused by the states motivations to attract enterprises from the neighbor states with less open regulations. Intrastate interest groups could moderate the impact of interstate competition by making the competition more salient or providing alternative ways other than regulations to deal with the competition. By examining the early regulation formation of the commercial drone industry, this paper finds general support for the arguments."
2018,"Toward a Theory of Entry in Moral Markets: The role of social Movements and Organizational Identit A growing body of research on moral marketssectors whose raison detre is to offer market solutions to social and environmental issues or to express a valued social identityhas offered critical insights into the emergence and growth of these sectors. Less is known, however, about why some firms enter moral markets while others do not. By drawing from research on market entry, organizational identity, and the social movement literature, we develop a theory that highlights the potential of organizational identity to explain variation in entry in moral markets. We then expand our framework by theorizing about contingencies that alter the shape of the relationship between organizational identity and market entry: the flexibility of organizational identity, and the type and orientation of the social movement supporting the moral market. Finally, we discuss the contributions of our framework and opportunities for extension."
2018,"Trust attitudes and behaviors among exchange partners Trust and trustworthiness play a critical role in inter-organizational collaboration especially between supply chain partners. The question arises whether supply chain decisions that seem to indicate trust are actually related to trust attitudes in that setting. Furthermore, we ask the question, which target of trust attitudes matter? We explore these questions while studying business executives decisions in a dyadic supply chain exchange. We measure two targeted measures of trust attitudes. Network trust refers to trust attitudes toward potential partners in current exchanges, while preconditioned trust refers to trust attitudes toward outside business partners in prior experiences. To quantify trust behaviors, we observe the executives making decisions in a forecast information sharing experiment that simulates a fundamental and actively studied research topic in supply chain management. Executives with high preconditioned trust consciously base their trust behaviors on network trust (i.e., the perceived trustworthiness of their current exchange partners) and do not require (or rely on) repeated interactions to act trustfully. In contrast, executives with low preconditioned trust rely more on repeated interactions to trust their supply chain partners. These results offer valuable insights into how researchers can further integrate and advance our knowledge of trust, and how organizations can better leverage executives' trust intelligence to improve supply chain efficiency."
2018,"Digital Alternatives as Providers of Institutional Trust: Evidence from a Natural Experiment Drawing on the institutional trust literature, we propose a competitive theory of trust to explain how policy decisions of trust producing institutions (e.g. state agencies) lead to institutional trust ambivalence among three dimensions  fairness, reliability, and predictability  that consequently leads different organizations, to compete for trust. Our main thesis is that when a policy decision by the state agencies invoke trust ambivalence among different dimensions, depending on the intensity of ambivalence, the alternative providers of trust, as well as alternative channels through which the trust is provided will become more trusted in relative terms, in correlation with how further away they are from the state providers, and state promoted channels. We test our hypotheses in the context of a currency system by collecting rich qualitative (linguistic analysis of social media) and quantitative data (panel data analysis employing regression discontinuity design) on the demonetization implemented by Indian government in November 2016. Results suggest that demonetization policy resulted into institutional trust ambivalence, by negatively impacting predictability, while only positively impacting fairness, and reliability dimensions. This ambivalence conversely resulted in the alternative providers (private banks), and channels (digitized payments) of trust for transactional utility of currency, as well as alternative providers (Bitcoins) for investment venues becoming more trusted. Our study contributes to the literature on institutional trust, as well as on digitization and decentralization."
2018,"Collocation, competition and alter-broker tie persistence Extant work in the network literature suggests that brokers advantages dissipate quickly as alters come to know about brokerage. However, taking the alters perspective, we ask whether and under what conditions an alter might choose to continue its relationship with the broker despite having information about the broker and the other alter. We argue that the broker-alter relationship is more likely to persist when they are geographically collocated, for reasons of trust, informal multiplex ties and lowered transaction costs. We further posit that the relationship between alter and broker is less likely to persist if the other alter is a competitor. Finally, we posit that the positive effect of collocation between alter and broker will be negatively moderated in case of transactions with a competing alter. We test our hypotheses using a unique dataset of 2166 transactions between a ship operator (the focal alter) over the period 2011- 2015, with 191 brokers and 522 associated alters (charterers) in the bulk shipping industry. Our results broadly support our theorizing. We thereby contribute to the stream of research studying the role of geography and network persistence, and also explore the contingent effects of alter characteristics on the continuation of the structural hole."
2018,"External Power Dynamics: Piecing a Fragmented Understanding of Interorganizational Decision-making The literature has unreasonably debilitated resource dependence theorys explanatory power by haphazardly omitting external relations when exploring subsidiary decision-making and MNC power dynamics, myopically considering subsidiary power as having solely an MNC-internal component. The result is researchers exposing themselves to a fragmentary understanding of what truly drives subsidiary decision-making with respect to its knowledge development and, by extension, to its external embeddedness. In this conceptual paper we present a novel model that parses subsidiary power into internal and external power, and conceives it in terms of utility. We argue that the subsidiarys total utility is a function of internal power (vis--vis the sister subunits) and external power (vis--vis local actors), therefore it aims to maximize its total power. However, since access to external network resources reduce the subsidiarys inherent uncertainty from dependence on HQ resources, it increasingly places greater importance and focus on power dynamics in external relationships. As such, the subsidiary sacrifices internal power for external power, a welcome tradeoff it can leverage as bargaining power (vis--vis the HQ). By contrast, to increase its utility, the HQ seeks to decrease its own bargaining power."
2018,"Complexifying reflection: Towards how collective reflection works in organizations Reflection in its social notion has mainly been studied in a temporary way of actors stepping back to question taken-for-granted assumptions of organizing. Drawing on a single case study of introducing lean production to a hospitals emergency care unit (ECU) over a period of 23 months, we aim to explore how reflection works in organizations given the ongoing flux of organizing and understanding reflection as a social phenomenon. We identify four practices that together make up collective reflection in our case and whose activities differ according to where joint reflection takes place, what it is mainly about, who is involved and when it occurs. These insights complexify our current understanding of collective reflection in four ways: First, reflection in its social notion contains several activities, which together ensure communicative availability that cannot be taken as given in organizations. Second, collectively reflecting in organizations calls for taking its value creation into account (reflecting from within or from outside the organizational value creation). Third, collective reflection encompasses two different orientations regarding the organizational value creation (reflecting in order to keep day-to-day business running and/or to improve the conditions for the value creation). Fourth, we empirically find that the reflection activities follow two different temporal rhythms (ad-hoc responses to a situation at hand or pre-planned regular activities). With these insights we contribute new nuances to our understanding of how collective reflection works in organizing."
2018,"Considering Information Technology in Organization Studies: Context, Practice, and Pragmatism While technology and organization studies have a shared history, this relationship has faded. Yet, ongoing technological changes raise interesting questions for organizations and organizing. To address these phenomena, organizational scholars need a variety of ways for studying technology in organizations. I present three alternative approaches to information technology in organization studies. First, technology as context situates organizational phenomena in a technological setting. Second, technology as practice focuses on the use of technology in organizations. Third, I introduce a pragmatist approach to technology in organizations. This approach emphasizes the features, affordances, and processes of technologies and organizing. Last, I explore how the approaches can contribute to organization theory."
2018,"Spacing and Organizing: Process Approaches to the Study of Organizational Space In the past several decades, the research on space in management studies has moved from being an implicit idea to becoming an important generative force in organizational theory. Through this turn, space no longer surfaces as a stable container in which organizing occurs, rather it is a process for enacting organizing. Even with the growth of studies on organizational space, only a modicum of work exists that aims to distill and theorize the notion of space as organizing. This paper sets forth a typology of process studies on organizational space linked to two dimensions and five approaches for conceiving of space as organizing. In offering this typology, it not only provides an overview of recent advances in management literature, but also links the research on organizational spacing to conceptions of order and disorder."
2018,"What We Do in the Shadows: The Formality of Informal Organizing Formal and informal structures shape organizations and the interaction of actors within. Surprisingly, just recently organizational theorists have started focusing on studying the interplay of both structures. However, most studies focus on how formal influence informal structures, viewing formal changes as clear. Building on a 16-month case study of a reorganization and CEO succession in a family-owned company, the study investigates the interplay of formal and informal structures. I find that informal structures can, in times of weak formal structures, partly substitute tasks of the formal organization through processes of encapsulation and rerouting, creating a temporal shadow organization. The study thus contributes to the literature on organizing and organizational design by showing how informal structures can shape formal organizing."
2018,"An Experimental Test of Social Network Opportunity, Choice, and Structure in Evaluation Updating In many facets of life, individuals make evaluations that they may update after consulting with others in their peer group or social network. But not all individuals have the same opportunities for social interaction in a given group or network, or the ability and desire to make use of those opportunities that are available to them. Moreover, the configuration of a persons network can alter how information is spread or signals are interpreted. Hence, mechanisms in addition to individuals social opportunities and choices to make use of them come into play in regard to how they may affect how individuals update their evaluations. Distinguishing these mechanisms has, however, been very difficult, because they are entwined. This research develops and employs a novel experimental platform to empirically assess evaluation updating. Participants viewed and evaluated an entrepreneurial video pitch stimulus and were then randomly assigned either to groups and network positions within groups, or to a baseline condition with no opportunity for social interaction and thus peer influence. Results reveal that those assigned a hub position in the group network updated their evaluations of the stimulus considerably more negatively than those assigned to spokes, or the control condition for no social interaction. Results also demonstrate that group-level network structures that are fully connected magnify negativebut not positivepeer effects given network reverberation and the negativity bias. Theoretical and empirical implications and extensions are discussed. Keywords: Social evaluation, peer effects, networks, experiment, entrepreneurial pitch, agency-structure"
2018,"Relativity in Peer Effects: Evidence from a Travel Agency An individual's peers at work affect her on-the-job performance in important ways. Prevailing research argues that the magnitude of these peer effects depends on the worker's or peers' absolute levels of performance. In contrast, theorize about the distance between the worker's performance and those of one's peers, rather than the absolute performance levels of either one. I argue that the extent to which a worker's performance changes in response to peers depends on how much better or worse one's peers are relative to the focal worker, which I term relative performance. I test my arguments using longitudinal data of call center workers at the largest travel agency in China. Results indicate that a worker's responsiveness to peers is shaped by the extent to which she is relatively better or worse than her peers. Furthermore, I exploit a field experiment that took place at the same organization to rule out confounding factors could have generated peer effects."
2018,"Doing Well and Doing Good? Employee Exit in Social Enterprise The literature on hybrid organizations offers a number of strategies designed to avoid destabilizing, internal tensions within such organizations. We argue, however, that in implementing these practices, hybrid organizations may unintentionally create new challenges for frontline employees and increase their likelihood of exit. We examine a microfinance bank that enacted practices designed to minimize internal, inter-group tensions. We find that this approach left loan officers ill-prepared to achieve the banks key social outreach goal of lending to poor clients. Through qualitative observations, we show how these practices contributed to a lack of fit, unmet expectations, and unproductive social comparisons among loan officers. Through quantitative analyses of the banks employee database, we show that loan officers were more likely to exit the bank when lending to the poor constituted a greater proportion of their workload. Overall, this study reveals an important, unintended outcome of hybrid organizing, and demonstrates how efforts to avoid internal conflict can displace organization-level tensions onto individual employees."
2018,"Stakeholder Orientations Differential Effect on Positive and Negative Employee Growth Rates This paper examines the causal effect of stakeholder orientation on growth rates utilizing exogenous variation in stakeholder orientation due to the staggered implementation of stakeholder friendly constituency statutes in various US states. Stakeholder orientations effect on growth is unclear because it enhances resource access but simultaneously affects resource allocation by introducing ambiguity in the objective function and increasing stakeholder involvement in decision making. Results indicate that firms that orient themselves towards their stakeholders grow and downsize at lower rates. Together with additional analyses, these findings suggest that stakeholder-oriented firms employ stronger selection criteria, choosing only those opportunities for growth and downsizing that satisfy all relevant stakeholders. Thus, stakeholder orientation changes the growth process, suggesting that stakeholder strategy and growth strategy are highly related."
2018,"The Causal Effect of Social Networks on Elite Recruitment Using information on 12,752 passing candidates of the Chinese civil service examinations (CCSEs) between 1400 and 1580, we provide evidence on the causal effect of social networks on recruitment into a particular labor market, the bureaucracy of imperial China. We use a unique institutional feature of the CCSEs as the identification strategy. The candidates with invariant human capital took two otherwise similar exams within one month apart, but were evaluated anonymous only for one exam. This variation in anonymity provides a necessary condition for varying extent of social network activation. The examiners only had opportunity to activate the exogenously formed networks during the non-anonymously evaluated exams. Even the most conservative estimates show that the relative effect of social networks versus school quality (i.e., one human capital measure) on the recruitment outcomes (relative rankings) is between 216% and 327%. Our research has policy implications for network-induced labor-market inequalities and countermeasures by appropriately designed anonymous evaluation."
2018,"Perceived Uncertainty and the Internal Dynamics of Routines Research has established perceived uncertainty as a major preoccupation of organizations and their members. Yet, our understanding of the relationship between uncertainty and the internal dynamics of routines is limited. This paper contributes to this understanding by building on and extending the performative perspective of routines, which conceptualizes routines as generative systems holding the seeds of their own continuity and change. We propose that differences in the level of uncertainty (i.e., high versus low) perceived by participants in routines are likely to produce significant, differential effects on the internal dynamics of routine creation and evolution and the balance between stability and change in routines. Our work contributes to the literature on routine dynamics by providing a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between the internal dynamics of routines and perceived uncertainty."
2018,"Slack, Problemistic Search,and New Practice Adoption During Institutional Change:A Behavioral View By drawing from the behavioral theory of the firm, this study explores the intra-organizational mechanisms through which organizations respond to competing demands from multiple institutional logics. The focus is on how slack resources and problemistic search affect the degree to which organizations amid institutional change comply with the challenging logic, when the incumbent logic is still exerting its influence. Our empirical setting is a panel sample of 254 U.S. county governments faced with the conflict between the market logic of the New Public Management movement (the challenging logic) and the bureaucratic logic of traditional public administration (the incumbent logic). This study examines when these organizations are more (or less) likely to adopt the new, market-oriented practices of outsourcing public services. Slack resources are found to be conducive to the adoption of the new practices until they are substantial enough to help organizations remain unchanged. The results also show that new practices are less likely to be adopted when organizations have met their aspiration level related to the challenging logic or when organizations have failed to meet their aspiration level related to the incumbent logic. Our findings contribute to the literature on both institutional complexity and the behavior theory."
2018,"Toward Sustainable Joint Value Creation: Navigating Tensions and Shifting Orientations Joint value creation emerges from the relationships between the firm and its stakeholders and a mismanagement of these relationships can result in value destruction. Managers thus have to handle these relationships through suitable stakeholder management. Yet there is not solely one approach to stakeholder management but rather two types of approach: the exclusive approach and the inclusive approach. While the existing literature on joint value creation informs us on how insights from both approaches are useful for short-term performance, silence remains about the implications of these approaches for long-term success and thus sustainability. In this conceptual paper, we propose a paradox perspective on joint value creation  an approach that embraces the concomitant needs for stakeholder exclusiveness and stakeholder inclusiveness over time. Such an approach allows mapping out the different tensions and evaluating their impact on the changing stakeholder relationships that are conducive for joint value creation. The paradox perspective leads to an understanding of joint value creation in stakeholder theory that moves beyond either/or thinking by highlighting how the two approaches contradict each other when they are simply juxtaposed, but can complement each other when applied sequentially through dynamic decision-making."
2018,"How Do Founding Teams Form? Towards a Behavioral Theory of Founding Team Formation We advance organization theory by developing a conceptual model of how founding teams form. Our neo-Carnegie model situates founders in particular network-structural milieu, engaging in aspiration-driven search for and evaluation of prospective cofounders. Founding team formation is a consequence of mutually favorable evaluations in a multi-sided matching process. Our multi-level model provides new insights on the formation pathways of founding teams and their initial task and relational endowments, and it draws new links between neo-Carnegie theory and the literature on social cognition. Our central proposition is that founding teams formed prior to opportunity identification are qualitatively different from teams formed post opportunity identification."
2018,"How and Why Does a Scandal Influence Media Heterogeneity? Calciopoli and the Italian Newspapers This paper contributes to the nascent organizational literature on scandals by analyzing the durable consequences of a scandal within a field. Specifically, we explore how media heterogeneity changes after a scandal. Understanding such a change is crucial because it affects how the entire field recovers from the disruption of a scandal, how the specific wrongdoers restore their public image, and the credibility of the same media outlets. Extant research suggests multiple and contrasting social processes at play after a scandal that can influence media heterogeneity. We study how the Calciopoli scandal, which affected the Italian football league in 2006, impacted the heterogeneity in reporting referees decisions among the three Italian national sports newspapers. We find that media heterogeneity increases after a scandal only for the teams involved in it. One key mechanism is the intensification in newspapers partisanship toward their local teams. Interestingly, we found that, despite this growth in partisanship, newspapers are largely able to not compromise the credibility of their reporting. In fact, when commenting on the same episodes, we find a low level of media heterogeneity. Therefore, partisanship arises mainly from reporting episodes omitted by other newspapers and not by holding different opinions on the same episodes."
2018,"Why We Need a Paradigm Shift in Management: Returning Humanity into Organizational Discourse A number of voices have recently begun to question the efficacy and epistemic authority of the natural sciences paradigm in the social sciences, and suggested that social science theories built strictly on such scientific logic actually end up misleading, instead of enhancing, the practice of management (Anderson 2000, Ghoshal 2005). We begin by demonstrating how, over the years, the social sciences gradually subsumed models that were irrelevant, or even downright misleading, by imitating the natural sciences paradigm. This is a trend that seems to have begun when social science scholars sought to defend the legitimacy of their fields as mature sciences on par with the natural sciences. Interestingly, there was a simultaneous shift to referring to people at work as human resources or capital, a phrase that emphasizes the productive capacities of human beings as income-producing economic agents (Hornbeck & Salamon, 1991). In this paper we will argue that bringing back humanity into the discourse will change the way in which organizations are conceptualized and managed. Since people spend most of their waking hours in the work place, organizations driven by the compassion ethos will result in an improvement in the quality of life (Etzione 1988, Frost 1999, Frost et al. 2005)."
2018,"Days of Future Passed: Temporal Anchoring Devices and the Dynamics of Organizational Identity Organizations face a challenge to provide a sense of identity continuity to internal and external audiences, while simultaneously attending to organizational and environmental changes. Drawing on ideas from institutional and social constructivist perspectives, we introduce a new concept - temporal anchoring devices, which are identity discourses with a reference to time, and explore their role in organizational identity dynamics. We conducted qualitative case studies of three chocolate producers; all three established in the first half of the 19th century. In examining the histories of these organizations we paid attention to their (discontinuation of) use of temporal anchoring devices, or no use of temporal anchoring devices at all. We found that organizations use of temporal anchoring devices is related to (internal) organizational and environmental changes. We argue that the use of temporal anchoring devices aids organizational changes by creating a sense of organizational identity continuity during these changes. In addition, the (discontinuation of) use of temporal anchoring devices allows the organization to realign its identity with the changes in the organizations environment. Our findings have implications for how we understand environmental influence on the (re)construction of organizational identity and the role temporal anchoring devices play in the dynamics of organizational identity."
2018,"The ambivalent effects of complexity and network structure on firms sustainability performance In this paper, we highlight the ambivalent and interrelated role of cognitive frames, sectoral logics, and social networks in affecting the corporate sustainability performance. A firm faces opportunities and constraints if it experiences complexity due to multiple frames and institutional logics, and manages this through its network configurations. We demonstrate that if a firms partners hold a different organizational frame, and belong to different sectors, firms sustainability performance improves first due to exposure to diversity, but then it decreases due to tensions and confusions. This inverse U shape relationship is flipped if a firm occupies a brokerage position in its network. The brokerage position of a firm is beneficial only when complexity is very high. The benefit to learn from diversity through cohesive relationships is sacrificed in favour of managing the complexity through structural holes."
2018,"Challenging the functionality of audits: Examining the bureaucratization of risks with Franz Kafka Social audits have become the primary approach to managing risks in global production networks. Many have criticized the incapacity of this approach. Most of this criticism focuses on situational deficiencies of social auditing practices such as insufficiently trained auditors or incomplete auditing protocols, thereby assuming a general functionality of social audits. This paper instead turns attention to the inherent limitations and paradoxes of this form of risk management. Drawing on the work of Franz Kafka and introducing the notion of audits as bureaucratization of risks we argue that the incapacity of social audits to protect workers in global production networks results not only from the violations of bureaucratic rules, but also from an exact compliance to these rules. Particularly, we show that social audits reproduce some of the conditions that made their implementation necessary in the first place. Pointing to such insolvable dilemmas, the paper contributes to a better understanding of the systemic incapacities of social audits to manage risks, but also sheds new light on the value of the work of Kafka for understanding bureaucratic forms of organizing."
2018,"Turning lead into gold: How conflict shapes field settlements in Canadian mining This study examines the role of conflict in a field settlement over time. Drawing from a 20 year longitudinal study of a settlement around the issue of social and environmental sustainability in Canadian mining, I elucidate how conflict between incumbent firms and an internal governance unit (IGU) shapes and modifies a settlement in unexpected ways. In contrast to research that views conflict as destructive to field settlements, I demonstrate how conflict serves multiple and evolving roles in field settlements. Specifically, in periods where an IGU has a high degree of power, conflict can be productive for a settlement by working to increase the legitimacy of a settlement to both incumbents and challengers in the field. In periods of low power for an IGU, conflict may be destructive for a settlement and may lead to an internal weakening of the settlement which hurts its legitimacy to challengers in the field. However, I demonstrate how this destructive aspect of conflict can be mitigated by resistance strategies aimed at restoring the legitimacy of the settlement to challengers. I discuss the implications of my findings for research on settlement durability in organizational fields defined by contested issues and IGUs in settlement processes."
2018,"Institutional and Emotional Dynamics on the Dark Side of Legitimacy: Anti-Corruption at SMEs We explore the dark side of legitimacy, i.e., situations when legitimacy is largely taken-for- granted while negative consequences for society are not revealed. We build on a case study of anti-corruption at small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). Normally, SMEs do not receive much public attention and are not scrutinized. As a result, their legitimacy is not contested, but taken for granted. By contrast, MNCs often have problems with societal approval due to higher public scrutiny, NGO activism, and frequent scandals reported in the media. We identify that, typically, SMEs seek to maintain and justify their status-quo of taken-for-granted legitimacy by applying a set of rationalizations (e.g., we are too small to matter; if everybody else does it...). We argue that such SMEs avoid anti-corruption policies and public surveillance to delib-erately stay off the anti-corruption radar. Surprisingly though, our inductive study reveals that there are two dynamic paths away from the dark side of legitimacy, and that emotions tend to be a crucial trigger for such dynamics. We thus contribute to the institutional theory literature by arguing that emotions, both positive and negative, are crucial for developing theory on institu-tional change in the absence of clear or dominant institutional pressures."
2018,"Institutional legacies: Examining the interplay between emotions and imprinting Employing a longitudinal, mixed-method research design, we examine how variations in the imprinting processes of three political eras spawned different contemporary understandings of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in China. As an authoritative regime, China provides an illuminating counterpoint to studies from Western capitalist contexts  which tend to emphasize highly agentic processes wherein entrepreneurial individuals creatively navigate, and selectively acquire resources from, their external environments. Such depictions are complicated in the Chinese context because of the presence of the Communist Party of China, whose influence permeates every facet of society. Our comparative examination revealed important differences in how the regimes mobilized and regulated emotions in support of political objectives and institutional projects. By articulating these differences, our study provides theoretical leverage for explaining why certain imprints may be more resilient than others."
2018,"The human-ecological apparatus: Extraction and error in an Alaskan commercial fishery The dearth of management research on sustainable development in natural resource extraction contexts is problematic in the face of increasing global rates of change in ecosystem dynamics. This study aims to help remedy this mismatch by both analyzing the human and natural organization that constitutes natural resource extraction contexts, as well as how that organization can produce undesired effects on natural systems. This study asks, how does organization constituted by both humans and nature form in a natural resource extraction context? How does this organization result in undesired effects on natural systems? To answer these questions, this study builds an analytical framework from the literature on sociomateriality and then applies it to qualitative interview, observational, and archival data from a two-year ethnography of commercial fishing practices in an Alaskan trawl fleet. This application reveals an organizational whole constituted by both human and ecological activity, as well as internal mechanics in this context. Drawing from the sociomaterial literature, this study theorizes the whole as a human-ecological apparatus, which is a mode of natural resource production that operates through the organized entanglement of human and non- human activity. The findings further suggest that apparatuses have the paradoxical effect of simultaneously creating assemblages and silos: they merge disparate activities into assemblages, yet at the same time they render their relationship more abstract. The findings suggest that this effect is due to the indirect nature of the materiality that the apparatus produces, and through which it operates. Effects of the assembled yet abstractly- related activities tends to ancillary, and often unexpected, negative impacts on the assembled activities. We argue that such apparatuses, and such effects, prevalent both in natural resources extraction contexts and organizational contexts more generally."
2018,"Occupational Invocation: Managing Experts through Community Norms Using data from a 16-month ethnographic study of a pharmaceutical company research unit, we examine how managers can successfully manage expert contractors. These expert scientists perform essential work in advancing drug development projects. However, they often complete work late, refuse to perform requested work, and act in other ways that managers believe impedes project progress. Although the literature on expert management suggests that these challenges can be overcome by rewarding, punishing, and socializing experts, these practices are difficult to implement when expert workers are contracted from outside of the organization. We show how managers can manage expert contractors through a process we label occupational invocation. In this process, managers first publicly highlight experts breaches of shared occupational norms. Managers then reintegrate experts by providing them with an opportunity to display a correction of their actions such that they align with the communitys expectations as well as the contracting organizations interests. By referencing common norms, occupational invocation helps enable the management of expert contractors."
2018,"Writing in occupational communities as a lens to study becoming, doing, and relating. In this empirical study of diplomatic correspondence in the occupational community of French diplomats, I argue that the practice of writing, using a genres lens, is an analytical entry point to the study of the dynamics of occupational communities, such as becoming a diplomat, doing diplomatic work, and relating within the community and in the organization. The three lenses of becoming, doing and relating as suggested by Anteby, Chan and Dibenigno (2016) help unpack how genres help produce and reproduce the external boundaries of the occupational community, and its internal stratification."
2018,"Pebble in Still Water: How Implementing 3D Printing Reconfigures Boundary Relations in a Hospital This paper examines how occupations mobilize, expand or defend their jurisdictional boundaries while simultaneously collaborating when a new technological innovation creates upheaval. We report on a two-year, longitudinal qualitative study of how medical 3D printing  a technology that transforms digital models into physical objects  was implemented in a UK hospital organization. We adopt a practice lens for examining boundary work practices as enacted by different occupational groups, viewing boundaries as relational, dynamic, and in a state of becoming. We extend theory on how occupations enact boundary work practices not only during adversarial encounters but also during multidisciplinary collaboration across disciplinary and knowledge boundaries. We focus on how jurisdictional boundaries are challenged over time; how new competencies are developed, new roles established, status and legitimacy challenged or reinforced and with what occupational consequences for the groups involved. Our findings highlight the ongoing jurisdictional contestations between four groups, presenting an opportunity for unpacking how the materiality of artifacts and spaces is constitutive of the way occupations mobilize, maintain and expand their jurisdictional boundaries."
2018,"Professionals as Agents of Globalization: The Role of Security Analysts in Financial Globalization This study aims to understand the role of professionals as a key agent in shaping globalization. Specifically, drawing on the sociology of professions, we view international security analysts as professional agents that facilitate financial globalization and examine whether and under what circumstances they influence the extent to which a country is financially integrated into the global economy. Our analysis of cross-border capital inflows into 77 countries from 1987 to 2007 reveals that international analysts in a given country positively affect capital inflows to that country in the forms of both foreign portfolio investments (FPI) and foreign direct investments (FDI). Furthermore, we found that such influence of international analysts on capital inflows in a given country is more salient in less-developed than in more-developed capital markets. This study contributes to our understanding of the role of professionals as a key actor in transforming economic and social systems by shedding new light on analyst professionals as a prominent actor affecting financial globalization."
2018,"Racist on Tuesdays: The Relationship between High-Salience Events and Variation in Discrimination One of the persistent questions in the social sciences is why economic discrimination continues despite legal and social pressures. Multiple studies have considered how large organizations may reduce inequality through organizational or regulatory change. However, it is less obvious how to reduce the interpersonal biases in the one-on-one interactions that dominate market interactions. In particular, taste-based biases are assumed to be constant: people who dislike the members of a particular group do not solicit new information or update their behavior. We propose that taste- based bias varies as the salience of the governing category fluctuates. We consider how an event that increases the salience of racial divisions might affect the unrelated economic activity of minoritiescrowdfunding project success. Our preliminary findings indicate that African- American founders experience negative effects, in particular for projects with a creative orientation, which may reflect the fact that these projects are more closely tied to the founder than technical projects. Finally, we have some evidence that African-American founders anticipate a negative response and that they are more likely to withdraw from the market than non-black founders. The findings suggest that changes in the national-level salience of a trait drive changes in founder and backer behavior, with founders anticipating bias, and financial contributions to projects by African Americans decreasing in the wake of a racially salient event."
2018,"Discrimination and Entrepreneurship: Evidence from LGBT Rights Laws This study revisits the well-established claim that reducing discrimination spurs entrepreneurial entry. We propose that the effect of antidiscrimination initiatives on entrepreneurship depends crucially on whether discrimination originates on the demand- or the supply-side of the entrepreneurial process. The benefits of antidiscrimination practices in the context of entry are based on the study of the demand-side discrimination, or bias which arises when prospective entrepreneurs face discrimination by key resource providers for a new venture (i.e., investors, banks, prospective employers). We hypothesize the opposite effect on the supply-side, or when prospective entrepreneurs face discrimination in paid employment. Using evidence from the enactment of LGBT antidiscrimination policies, we show that initiatives to reduce employer discrimination deter entry into entrepreneurship because they increase the appeal of paid employment relative to entrepreneurship. Despite the reduction in the rates of entrepreneurship, however, new ventures growth orientation increases because antidiscrimination policies motivate the pursuit of higher-potential opportunities."
2018,"When Does Discrimination Increase Predictive Accuracy? The Costs and Benefits of Discrimination Discrimination is a pervasive aspect of modern society and human relations. Building on judgment research, we develop a model that explains the mechanisms driving discrimination and describes situations in which discrimination is more likely to occur because decision makers benefit from increased predictive accuracy. Our work contextualizes existing statistical discrimination models, in which decision makers substitute group averages in the absence of reliable information about individual ability. We do so by incorporating two additional parameters into the decision making process: environmental uncertainty and decision maker inconsistency. We find that uncertainty severely dampens the benefits of discrimination and that inconsistency can overturn any benefit from discriminating (i.e., make discrimination costly). Our model implies that decision makers must acknowledge that discrimination is only beneficial under a very specific set of conditions and uncovers paths toward reducing the likelihood of discrimination occurring."
2018,"Taking a Pass: How Proportional Prejudice and Decisions Not to Hire Reproduce Sex Segregation We propose and test a theory of how decisions not to hire reproduce sex segregation through what we term proportional prejudice. We hypothesize that employers are less likely to hire anyone when the applicant pool contains a large proportion of gender atypical applicants  that is, applicants from a different gender than the typical job holder  because they view this as a signal of a poor quality applicant pool. Analyses, of over seven million job applications for over 700,000 jobs by over 200,000 freelancers on an online platform for contract labor support our contention. A survey experiment isolates the mechanism: Applicant pools with a larger proportion of gender atypical applicants were perceived as less likely to contain people who seemed skilled enough for the job. We conclude by demonstrating how our theory explains the mixed findings as to whether gender atypical job seekers are disadvantaged in the hiring process."
2018,"Learning within Hierarchies: An Empirical Test and Theoretical Extension of March (1991) In this study, we provide a theoretical extension to and the first empirical test of Marchs Exploration and Exploitation in Organizational Learning (1991). We qualify and extend Marchs conclusions on the impact of turnover by examining employee arrivals and departures separately, and the possibility that learning is impacted by a corporate hierarchy. To do so, we consider the impact of turnover at the corporate level and at the subunit level and impact of turnover on the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. Empirically, we use company directories from Motorola over a 24-year period to construct membership turnover measures for the corporate staff as well as for the firms subunits (locations). We pair this data with patenting behavior over the same period to test our conjectures and better understand the exploration-exploitation impact of learning within hierarchies."
2018,"Attention Grabbers: A Cognition-Capability Study of Early and Intense Attention to FinTech The recent integration of the cognition and capabilities literature streams is playing an emerging role in expanding adaptation decisions for organizations with managerial attention playing a specific role in defining organizational adaptation to technological change. Despite this emergence, the antecedents of managerial attention, particularly for temporal orientations of attention, have not been thoroughly developed theoretically or empirically. While managerial attention has been theorized as a capability, scholars have not yet identified how early and intense managerial attention develops as a capability. In an analysis of the global banking sector between 2004 and 2015, I find empirical evidence supporting the notion that the capability of early and intense managerial attention to financial technology (FinTech) is predicted by previous attention to the related technology of mobile banking. This study supports the notion that capabilities are developed over time and contributes to cognition-based literature by identifying antecedents to managerial cognitive capabilities."
2018,"Looking Forward and Looking Backward Revisited: Search from Crude Mental Model with Feedback Delay Bounded rationality challenges agents ability to anticipate consequences prior to actions and the ability to interpret the outcomes of these actions. Forward-looking search processes which are based on an agents mental representation of an action-outcome linkage were shown to attenuate the former challenge of anticipation. Less has been explored about the relationship between these processes and the challenge of interpretation. In this study, we develop a theory by extending the credit assignment model to investigate how forward-looking search interacts with interpretation problems under the multistage problem setting. Our results show that crude mental representation may lower firm adaptation in the long run, suggesting a boundary condition of the effectiveness of forward- looking search. We describe a trade-off between error-reduction and error- amplification that arises during forward-looking search and explain how this trade- off is associated with the crudeness of mental representation."
2018,"Organizational Risk-Taking in Ambiguous Environments: Insurance and Hurricanes Experiential learning can be effective in guiding organizational risk-taking in relatively stable environments. That effectiveness breaks down when unexpectedly severe environmental disruptions signal that past probability distributions might no longer accurately describe the current and future states of the world. How do the resulting ambiguous environments moderate the relation between organizational learning and risk-taking? The paper investigates this question by comparing the impact of learning from past relative performances on homeowner insurance underwriting behavior in high- and low-hurricane-risk regions along the Gulf and Atlantic Coast between 1992 and 2013, a period of unprecedented record hurricane damage. A multi-level statistical analysis of a newly constructed panel dataset suggests that ambiguous environments significantly affected how learning from past performance influenced yearly underwriting changes in firms state subsidiaries. Compared to the low-risk region, relative over-performances reduced average annual homeowner insurance underwriting growth in the high-risk region; historically under-performing subsidiaries expanded their exposure at a significantly lower rate than units in the low-risk region. Qualitative evidence indicates that the deliberate use of catastrophe models to interpret ambiguous performance feedback explains this moderating effect. These findings not only demonstrate that performance feedback theory plays a role in explaining risk-taking in ambiguous environments, but also that this relevance is a deliberative effort by managers and firms to make sense of their experience."
2018,"Organizational Structures and the Improvement of Working Conditions in Global Supply Chains Exploitive working conditions have spurred the development of formal organizational structures that deploy mechanisms including legalization adherence to a set of law-like rules and proceduresand worker participation to improve labor standards in global supply chains. Yet little is known about whether these structures are associated with improved working conditions, especially in organizations in which they compete with productivity-driving economic incentives. Drawing on the economic sociology of law and organizations and theories of organizational learning, we investigate whether and how these formal organizational structures, individually and in combination, are associated with improved working conditions. Using data on 3,276 suppliers in 55 countries, we find greater improvement at suppliers that adopt legalization structures (operationalized as management system standards) and worker participation structures (unions) and find that the combination of these structures amplifies improvement. We find less improvement at suppliers with organizational incentive structures meant to increase worker productivity (piece-rate pay), but also find that this negative relationship is attenuated by organizational legalization and worker participation structures. These findings challenge existing theories of decoupling by showing how these organizational structures can be credible signals for improvement and can also be coupled with organizational changes via processes of organizational learning, even in the face of intense efficiency demands. Furthermore, our findings suggest important strategic considerations for managers selecting supplier factories and provide key insights for the design of transnational sustainability governance regimes."
2018,"Space as a Mechanism of Organizational Control in Collaborative Work Settings In this paper, we set out to explore and better understand how organizational space operates as a dynamic mechanism of organizational control in the context of collaborative work. Building a sociomaterial perspective on space as a mechanism of organizational control, we theorize the relationship between organizational space and control as entangled, i.e. mutually reinforcing and intensifying. Based on an ethnographic case study of a collaborative workspace and network of early-stage entrepreneurs, we show how spatial practices of the collaborative workspace operate as control by mobilizing and authorizing the early-stage entrepreneurs as a community, and by empowering and facilitating them to develop their entrepreneurial projects. The study contributes to (1) the studies on organizational space by illustrating how space functions as a mechanism of organizational control through situated practices; (2) the literature on organizational control by demonstrating how sociomaterial conceptualization of control allows better understanding about the various constitutive aspects of control; and (3) research on work transformations by elaborating on the materiality and spatiality of new work practices and workplaces. Keywords: organizational control, space, practices"
2018,"Hierarchy versus Flat: The Effect of Governance Structures on Conflict in Development Cooperatives Development organizations attempting to alleviate poverty increasingly utilize market-based approaches. These efforts consist of identifying unmet market opportunities and organizing local individuals into cooperatively owned enterprises to collectively exploit these opportunities. However, such cooperatives often struggle with high levels of intra-group conflict that hinder their functioning and long-term sustainability. Existing theory suggests that the choice of governance structure can play an important role in mitigating conflict, but a longstanding debate exists as to whether flat versus hierarchical governance structures are more efficacious. To add further understanding to this debate, we conducted a field experiment involving 40 newly formed development cooperatives within rural Ghana that were randomly assigned to either a flat or hierarchical structure. The quantitative results of our field experiment and subsequent qualitative data suggests that flat structures lead to higher levels of collective psychological ownership, which in turn resulted in lower levels of conflict as compared to hierarchical structures. However, our results also suggest that the extent to which flat governance structures are more effective depends on the salience of informal governance structures."
2018,"Managing hierarchy through organizational ceremonies: Insights from a disruptive event Seeking flexible structures, many organizations today are abandoning the ceremonies of hierarchy. The idea is that removing dress codes, segregated workspaces, and formality with superiors will de-emphasize status distinctions and encourage members of different rank to collaborate freely. On the other hand, researchers show that hierarchies are often resilient because they are reinforced by external institutions such as professions and industry norms. This study explores the conditions under which ceremonial change helps flatten large, institutionalized organizations. We report on an inductive study of four Toronto hospitals in which scripted experiences of the medical hierarchy were undermined by a disruption. We find that disruption to the ceremonial system weakened members commitment to hierarchies, sometimes helping junior members bring their expertise to settings usually reserved for senior members, but at other times leading to tensions and conflict. Based on the findings, we propose that institutionalized organizations can encourage flexible use of authority in a two-step process in which ceremonies emphasizing status distinctions are first replaced then senior members build consensus around new rules, norms, and beliefs that coordinate expertise."
2018,"Picking the low-hanging apples: The case of reverse cream skimming among Swedish private schools An increasingly common practice across the world is to introduce private alternatives into publically funded education systems. Economists have found that following from this practice, private schools often engage in what is called cream skimming, where they attract solely the most highly able students and thereby worsen the socio-economic stratification of the education system. In this paper, we argue that under conditions where for-profit schools are allowed, but they only receive a flat voucher per student, the phenomenon of reverse cream skimming where private schools selectively target the least motivated students is a likely outcome. We show this to be the case in a quantitative analysis of admissions to the secondary schools in a Swedish municipality from 1999 to 2017. Implications for theories of how schools compete, public education policy, and for institutional theory are discussed."
2018,"When Competition Escalates into Conflict  This article investigates the factors that escalate competition into dangerous conflict. Recent sociological theorizing claims that such escalations are particularly likely in dyads of structurally equivalent people (i.e., actors who have the same relations with the same third parties). Using panel data on Formula One races from 1970 through 2014, we model the probability that two drivers collide on the racetrack (an observable trace of conflict) as a function of their structural equivalence in a dynamic network of competitive relationships. Our main hypothesis, that the likelihood of conflict rises with structural equivalence, receives empirical support. Our findings also show that the positive association between structural equivalence and conflict is neither merely a matter of contention for official position nor an artifact of inherently- hostile parties spatially exposed to each other. Our analyses further reveal that this positive association is concentrated in a number of theoretically predictable conditions: among age-similar dyads, among stronger performers, in stable competitive networks, and in safe, rather than dangerous, weather conditions. Implications for future research on conflict, networks, and tournaments are discussed."
2018,"Unexpected Disruptions in Peer Effects In this study, I show that comparing against smart peers do not guarantee better performance, and could be disruptive in unexpected ways. New knowledge identified from comparison against able peers might not be beneficial either because of the lack of required knowledge-base to absorb and utilize them, or because of inability of actors to simultaneously master new information while exploiting what is already known. Moreover, envious emotions and tension triggered from comparison against able peers may not lead to constructive efforts to strengthen performance. Using data from a natural experiment where random assignment of peers occurs, I test whether peers with different ability levels influence the level of individuals academic achievement. My findings show that smart and successful peers are disruptive for performance, more so when they outperform the individual by a high margin. The study emphasizes that performance ramification of peers are multi-faceted, and that cognitive as well as non-cognitive processes could play a pivotal role in determining benefits of peer relations. More broadly, the study contributes to the nuanced understanding of how to learn and maximally benefit from peers in the organizations."
2018,"Boundary Kinking in Public Grading Schemes: The Effects of Tie Strength in Social Relationships Discontinuities frequently appear in the distribution of scores underlying the grades of public regulation schemes such as restaurant hygiene inspections. The typical study of such discontinuities conceives of them as representing rational behavioral responses to incentives inherent in the scheme itself. By contrast, we study how the evolving social relationships between inspectors and restaurants influence grading outcomes in a systematic manner. We study 512,313 inspections in Los Angeles County between 2000 and 2010, conducted by 606 inspectors in 29,666 restaurants. We find that the stronger the social tie between an inspector and a restaurateur, the more likely the inspector will be to fudge upward the inspection score. When aggregated, this behavior produces discontinuities  or kinks  in the distribution of scores occurring around the grade category boundaries. This behavior appears to be part of an implicit quid pro quo agreement: a lenient inspection in exchange for the restaurateur not requesting a re-examination. Importantly, the behavior generates public costs: restaurants that enjoy stronger social ties with inspectors are subsequently more likely to receive a customer complaint. These findings offer insight into how commensuration operates in the context of public grading schemes and point to a range of implications for sociological theory."
2018,"Balancing the Tradeoff or Stuck in the Middle? the Distinction of the Distinctiveness. By integrating the competitive and institutional perspectives, optimal distinctiveness theory views differentiation and legitimacy as a tradeoff in strategic positioning, suggesting a moderate level of distinctiveness as the means to improve performance. In challenging the universality of optimal distinctiveness and arguing for the potential compatibility between differentiation and legitimacy. We distinguish categorical distinctiveness (enhancing legitimacy) from competitive distinctiveness (enhancing differentiation) to examine the functional mechanism. Through a study of 2,710 private firms' industry positioning, we find that the effects of legitimacy and differentiation incompatible on funding likelihood, but are compatible on growth."
2019,"The Socio-Cognitive Bases of Reward Allocation: The Interplay between Status and Social in Peer-Base Although it is reasonable to assume that candidates status and audience-candidates social proximity combine to shape recognition in peer-based evaluative settings, exactly how these two factors combine is unclear because alternative theoretical perspectives that point to different explanatory mechanisms coexist in the literature. Our objective in this study is to shed light on this question using a mix-method approach. We first examine field data on the conferral of prestigious awards in a peer-based evaluative contest  The Silver Tag  one of the main peer-based digital advertising awards contests in Norway. We find the existence of a negative interaction between status and social proximity. We then offer more direct evidence of the causal mechanisms responsible this finding by conduction two experiments. In the first experiment, we replicate the main pattern of effects observed in the field study with stricter controls. In the second experiment, we document how the interaction effect is contingent on the nature of the evaluative setting. When audience members decisions are not in the public domain, social proximity does not temper the effect of status on candidates recognition, but it does when decisions are made in the public domain (i.e., audience member have to justify them before the other members). We conclude by discussing several implications of our study for research on the socio-psychological processes underlying the evaluation of creativity."
2019,"Not in Our Name! How Fields React to Stigma Contagion: Italian Co-ops Facing a Mafia Scandal. In this paper, we investigate the mechanisms through which stigma may spread from a single organization to an entire field, and how fields actors react to this stigma contagion. We do so by inductively investigating the process that the Italian co-op field went through to react to the stigma triggered by the uncovering of a mafia-type infiltration within the field. We find that fields actors may dilute stigma by re-conceptualizing and re-operationalizing the values behind their meaning system, in this way transforming the fields structure. Our evidence has the potential to link and contribute to research on organizational stigma, organizational fields, and values."
2019,"Reputation in Hollywood: Between Scandals and Solidarity In this study, we investigate how scandals, female solidarity and gender affect the reputations of male and female actors in the Hollywood system. Drawing both from an argument of stigmatization and celebration of evil geniuses and protection among peers, we formulate competing hypotheses on the impact of scandalous conduct on individual reputation. Then we investigate female solidarity as a process through which actors might gain support, status and friendship, reinforcing their reputation both directly and, indirectly, by complementing the effect of their personal misconduct. Finally, we investigate the role of gender in these relationships, assuming women, with respect to men, to be the ones who benefit more from female solidarity and who are hurt the most from personal scandals. We test our hypotheses on a person-year-event dataset involving 212 actors and 5,275 observations, using a multi-level longitudinal logistic regression model. Results support the view that both scandals and female solidarity are positive predictors of individual reputation, highlighting that both personal misconduct and the identification with the cause to fight gender injustice are relevant to individual reputation. In addition, while, as expected, women benefit from female solidarity more than men do, unexpectedly they can also leverage more on scandals than their male counterparts to gain reputation. To clarify the unexpected role of gender and its interplay with scandals, we conduct additional analysis to understand if specific categories of non-white women and female newcomers to the field are more likely than others to be subject to discrimination"
2019,"Gender and Paternalistic Leadership in China, a Critical Perspective Women have made significant social advancements in recent times in China, but as in most of the world they still face barriers to leadership positions. This is even (re)presented in the most popular indigenous Chinese theory of leadership: Paternalistic Leadership (PL). As a theory, PL overlooks the potential of women leaders. Acknowledging what may be understood as epistemological sexism, this article critically analyses PL as the dominant theoretical framework for the study of leadership in China. Gender bias inherent within the theory, and even its name. This is identified as a key weakness for its application. The use of a Postcolonial feminist leans to address this gender bias is introduced, applying concepts like Othering, Norm, and essentialisism. This article highlights the utility of postcolonial feminism to PL studies by introducing a conceptual toolkit for future researchers."
2019,"Extra-Organizational Determinants of Careers: Gendered Expert Authority and Attainment of Experts This paper studies factors outside of organizations that influence gender disparities in career attainment. We focus on one such extra-organizational factorexternal stakeholders perceptions of knowledge workers expertiseand provide task-level evidence that it differently shapes mens and womens careers. Using data on the production activities of early-career patent examiners at the United States Patent and Trademark Office, we find that patent applicants afford less expert authority to women than men, and that this difference in authority explains a large part of the gender gap in the examiners career progression. Female examiners face stronger resistance from applicants when issuing rejection decisions, compared to male examiners in the same technology field and job level. The resistance appears to be in part statistical in nature, as direct discussions with applicants are associated with higher acceptance of womens expert decisions. Women in our sample need to exert more effort than men to attain the same task outcomes as they require four discussions with applicants, on average, to achieve the same level of authority as men have without any discussions. Extra-organizational factors may thus substantially disadvantage women even in egalitarian workplaces."
2019,"Educational Prestige and Gender Differences in Financial Crisis Experiences This paper extends traditional explanations of gender differences in crisis experiences. In explaining female-specific crisis experiences, past studies have produced controversial findings. One group of scholars has emphasized that financial crises deepen the classic gender gap, whereas others have suggested that they can operate as opportunities for women. We develop this line of inquiry and focus on educational prestige as a key factor in determining when female workers have opportunities (vs. penalties) amid declining economic conditions. Using the empirical context of law professionals around the time of the 2008 financial crisis, this study found that female lawyers were more likely to experience adverse crisis events. However, this female penalty reversed into a female-specific opportunity when comparing graduates of elite law schools: compared to the male sample, elite female lawyers were less likely to experience decreased compensation, delayed promotions, and job loss during the crisis. The findings also indicated that such benefits from educational prestige diminished and even reversed into penalties when female law professionals had highly routinized work contexts. Through these findings, this paper provides novel insights into current explanations of the gender gap, particularly the growing interest in the heterogeneous labor market experiences of female workers."
2019,"Homophily, Biased Attention, and the Gender Gap in Science How does homophilous collaboration influence women's early career progress? To answer this question, we turn to a granular dataset of 3,233 highly qualified junior life scientists who receive mentored, early career sponsorship from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and analyze their publication trajectories as careers unfold. Employing a matched sample approach that exploits variance in the sets of research contacts the junior scientists start out with, we distinguish sex differences in collaboration choices from potential differences in collaboration opportunities. We document that outsized gender homophily among women exists and primarily stems from how female leaders of scientific projects assemble their teams. Women continue same-sex collaborations as lead authors at twice the rate compared to men, on average, and in particular when the mentor is part of the author team or when the focal junior scientist leads the team. As such, systematic gender homophily among female scientists may engender the sponsorship and resources needed to motivate young women to join and pursue an academic career. On the flip side, we show that author teams led by women receive 11% less citations, on average, and up to 29% less citations for work of comparable caliber published in the most influential journals. Taken together, while women's propensity to working with other women may support early career researchers, biased attention to women's work may harm careers and, in particular, women who publish in the highest-impact journals and who would otherwise be poised to narrowing gender gaps at more senior career stages."
2019,"Mist, Fog or Clear? Diminishing Sensitivity to Status Differences Signaled by Rankings and Choice Rankings constitute a ubiquituous form of status hierarchy that structures the choices of decision makers in many settings. In this study we take a cognitive perspective on status to explain the effect of rankings on the choices made by decision makers in the context of applications to MBA programs. Building on models of diminishing sensitivity, we show that the perception of the value of a program decreases non-linearly as a function of rank with perceived status differences being salient near the top of the ranking and insignificant near the bottom. Furthermore, we argue that due to diminishing sensitivity intermediate rank signals are difficult to interpret. Such difficulty prompts decision makers to use reputation signals that provide cues about the evaluation of their choice third parties as a lens to interpret status signals. We test our hypotheses on a sample of 411,530 candidates to MBA programs in the United States. Our findings contribute to building a theory of how decision makers process status signals and how status signals affect decision making."
2019,"Why and when Do Venture Capital Firms Reciprocate Past Syndication Offers? This paper explores whether reciprocating relationships provide benefits to participating firms by examining venture capital syndication networks. Actively engaging in mutual, reciprocating relationships could signal a firms collaborative capabilities and attract potential collaboration partners. Yet, prior research focused on the effect of inter-firm relationships on status regardless of mutuality. In this paper, I examine if reciprocating inter-firm relationships confer added benefits. Evidence suggests that as firms accumulate more reciprocal relationships, their status increase, their performance improves, and depending on status, their access to future market opportunities could increase. Specifically, higher-status firms have lower chances of receiving market opportunities while lower-status firms have higher chances. Yet because of perceived quality, lower-status firms have difficulties forming mutual relationships. I suggest two conditions under which low-status firms can increase their chances of reciprocation: reducing uncertainty around their quality through recent successes and seeking a partner who has a complementary industry portfolio."
2019,"Captain or the Ship? How Individual and Organizational Status Affect Innovation in Orchestras Using a unique dataset on concert programming of symphony orchestras, we examine two under-investigated status dynamics in relation to innovation. From the supply side, we examine how the interplay of individual and organizational status lead to innovative concert programming decisions in symphony orchestras. Drawing on the social psychology literature on intra-group status dynamics, we argue that high status conductors are more likely to select innovative repertoires as their higher standing in the field signals legitimacy and provides them with greater autonomy. When these conductors are situated in high-status orchestras however, they prioritize gaining acceptance to the organization by signaling legitimate impression about one self, leading to less innovative decisions. From the demand side, we examine the audience response to innovative programming decisions and interesting dynamics to the rewards and penalties towards innovation of high-status actors. High-status actors were heavily penalized for innovation when the act created categorical doubt or was perceived as a betrayal, but received greater rewards when the act signaled higher capability. This study adds a fresh perspective on organizational innovation by attending to the interplay of individual and organization status. The study also contributes to the recent discussions on the audience evaluation towards deviance of high-status actors."
2019,"Trading Rare Events and Status Inconcistency In this paper I explore the role of third party quality evaluations in alleviating audiences interpretive difficulties in the face of rare events. Leveraging an emerging literature in the multidimensionality of status and status inconsistency, I argue that while status benefits organizations and products, the inconsistency between the status of the organization and the status of the product results in a penalty to the organization. High status organizations that offer low status products violate audiences expectations about product quality and are likely to be penalized. Low status organizations that offer high status products are likely to be seen as not credible and will thus not receive the full benefit of offering a high status product. I empirically test my hypotheses using data on all catastrophe bonds issued since the inception of the catastrophe bond market in 1996. My results show that despite the sophistication of this financial market, due to the unpredictability of rare events, investors use third party quality evaluations to overcome interpretive difficulties in making investment decisions. While third party quality evaluations are positive for the valuation of a product, the inconsistency between the status of the organization and the status of the product has moderating effects on the benefits of status."
2019,"The symbolic effect of status on performance: Effect or fable? Research on status has focused on performance advantages that are generated by signaling, a mechanism through which audiences perceive the quality of a high-status actor to be higher, under conditions of uncertainty about actors intrinsic quality. As a result, audiences value more highly, pay more attention to or seek out more the actors output or endorsement, thereby generating a disproportionate advantage for the actor. However, status might also generate advantages in conditions of near perfect information about actors quality, through a symbolic mechanism. Such advantages would help generate value for the high status actor, and organizations they are a member of, independent of audience quality perceptions and re-evaluations. Our empirical design investigates the existence of a causal symbolic effect of status on performance by leveraging a difference-in-differences approach, in a context where status change does not influence either the quality perception or size of reference audiences. Moreover, we disentangle the symbolic effect of status on performance between its impact on the level of input in terms of access to opportunities, and productivity in terms of output for a given amount of input. We test our two hypotheses in the context of the National Basketball Association, comparing players performance before and after their participation to the All-Stars Game, as a treatment for a positive shock on status. Results show that an increase in status generates a positive effect on individual performance, but the effect is short lived."
2019,"Interdependent Routines and Innovation Processes  An Ethnographic Study of Scrum Teams Organizational routines are an important concept to understand how organizations coordinate their work. Most research on organizational routines seems to assume that a concise description of the outcomes that routines produce exists a priori. Work in organizations, however, is oftentimes characterized by high degrees of complexity, uncertainty and ambiguity. In such cases, the outcomes that routines produce are only partially defined in advance and constantly change their shape over time. Hence, this paper focuses on contexts, like innovation processes, in which routines produce outcomes that are largely unknown in the beginning, but are constantly in the process of becoming. We combine theory on epistemic objects and routines to understand how software development teams of a medium sized company deal with highly complex and ambiguous issues to be resolved. We present our ethnographic study of these teams working with the Scrum framework and show that performing multiple organizational routines orchestrates the unfolding of innovative processes."
2019,"Making Sense of the Ineffable: How Film Workers Make Their Intuitions Meaningful  While research on intuition in organizational settings is growing, we still know little about how practitioners make sense of, and talk about, their intuitions. In this paper, we adopt a discursive sensemaking approach to study this question. Building on 32 interviews with film workers, we identify three sensemaking resources by which these practitioners make sense of their intuitions: sensible words, body metaphors, and a hypostatic figure (e.g., the film orders me). We then develop a model that shows how film workers move from one sensemaking resource to another: while film workers initially make sense of their intuitions by rooting them in their senses and their body (sensible words and body metaphors), they gradually move their intuitions out of their flesh, in an external entity (the hypostatic figure of the film). Applying a discursive sensemaking lens to intuition and expanding the scope of sensemaking research to the ineffable allows us to make three contributions to organizational scholarship: First, we complement sensemaking research by identifying a new sensemaking resource  the hypostatic figure. Second, we suggest that discursive sensemaking resembles an externalization process. Finally, we contribute to the intuition literature by putting the question of sense at the core of the intuitive experience."
2019,"I Have a Bad Feeling. Now What? How Film Crews Act Their Intuitions into Sense Having an intuition can be a confusing experience, at the crossroads between sense and non-sense. How do people make sense of and act upon such a feeling? To study this overlooked question, we adopt a sensemaking approach. We observed film crews on the set and developed a unique analytical technique to track intuitions trajectories from their emergence within an individual to their fading away or existence. We show that film crews act their intuitions into sense in three phases: sensing, making, and talking. Each phase enables intuition to acquire a new property  detectability, solidity and authority  that inverts, overcomes, or eliminates (respectively) an obstacle preventing intuitions from being acted into sense. We make three contributions: our study first contributes to refine the conceptualization of sense in the sensemaking literature. Second, we contribute to the intuition literature by showing how intuitions properties are not stable, but instead emerge and evolve in relations with the surrounding environment. Finally, our study contributes to the organizational literature on decision-making by arguing that, just like analytical rationality requires specific resources to exist, intuition needs specific resources to matter in organizations."
2019,"Liminality, Disorganization and the Becoming of a Consultant Recent years has seen the concept of liminality grow in popularity and importance for organisational studies. As a concept that promises to allow for a focus on the fluid and transient nature of work, our critical review highlights that in contradiction liminality is treated as state rather than a dynamic process. The purpose of this paper is to revisit the anthropological roots of liminality and utilise process thinking to develop the idea of social life as continuous movement rather than objectified, static forms and structures. We investigate liminality through the processual notions of the disorganization and the social form of the stranger, embodying the implicit strangeness that characterises life as a border phenomenon; as the ambiguous movement between the immediate and the faraway. Highlighting the significance of this processual account of liminality we present our findings from a longitudinal study which closely followed the experiences of a novice consultant. We argue that a return to the anthropological roots of liminality with the inclusion of process theory allows us to uncover the dynamic processes of a liminal phase, allowing us to grasp the fluidity and becoming of organisational life."
2019,"Silencing Emotions: Survival through Narrating and Narrating for Survival In this paper, we address how individuals cope with emotional distress when working in extreme contexts. To address this issue, we examined 53 personal diaries of people working with Doctors Without Borders in war-torn environments. These environments are characterized by a culture of silence, where despite being encouraged to share and speak about their experiences and emotions, individuals tend to remain silent and some resort to writing narratives (personal diaries) as a way to cope. By analyzing their narratives, we illustrate how new entrants to the field initially attempt to disrupt the unwritten rule of silencing emotions but soon succumb to maintaining that culture of silence despite not being told by colleagues to remain silent. Our findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of how individuals deal with emotional distress by introducing the notion of silencing emotions and offer contributions at the nexus of emotions, organizational silence and institutional contradictions."
2019,"Intentionality: Bring Meaning Back in the MicroMacro Processes of Institutional Theory Despite the centrality of meaning in institutional theory, meaning tends to be inferred from observable behaviors and practices, taken literally from spoken or written texts, or simply assumed by researchers. This paper aims to clarify what meaning is and how we arrive at meaning by introducing the construct of intentionality. Understanding actors intended meanings is important in addressing the question of embedded agency because it enables researchers to go beyond the time orientations of agency and examine the content of agency, that is, the meaning an actor intended through an action. Intentionality and collective intentionality can inform our understanding of the relationship between actions and institutions and thus help us better address issues of institutional decoupling, institutional complexity, and institutional change."
2019,"Strategic Silences and Their Impact on Discursive Processes in Organizations and Fields In this conceptual manuscript, I explore how silence influences the communicative and discursive construction of organization(s) and fields. Starting from the assessment that organization theory has so far conceived of silence in restricted and overly negative ways, I first unpack silence and discuss its different dimensions. After outlining my general approach to silence vis--vis communication, I suggest a conceptual framework classifying silence, on the one hand, according to whether it constitutes a communicative presence or absence and, on the other hand, according to whether it supports or restricts ongoing communication. I develop invitation, suppression, acquiescence, and concealment as four central mechanisms through which silence impacts discursive processes such as (de-)legitimation, theorization, and translation in organizations and fields and discuss the conditions under which silence is most likely to manifest each of these mechanisms. Based on these conceptual ideas, I outline how communication-centered organization research may benefit from a more holistic and systematic integration of silence."
2019,"Ambition in Organizational Life: What the Heck Are We Talking About? The term ambition and its derivatives, such as ambitions, ambitious, and unambitious, constitute a commonly-used set of signifiers in business and managerial discourses. Despite this wide currency in the discourses of business professionals and practitioner-oriented publications, management researchers to date have not sought to understand ambition and the various ways that it figures in business discourses. In this paper, we take an interpretive, grounded theory approach to explore the intricate meanings and workings of the notion of ambition in three top-ranked practitioner-oriented business journals from 2010 to 2018. Our findings show that there are four different constellations of meaning that surround ambition. We identify and draw out the specifications of these constellations, which sheds light on how ambition is situated in different communicative contexts and connected with different regimes of managerial prescription. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of these findings for management and organization studies."
2019,"Governance of Sharing Economy Organizations: Exploring Social Bonding and Economic Transaction The sharing economy is constituted through a hybrid form of governance, combining the development of social bonding and economic transaction. Based on an understanding that enabling ideal social relations between individuals forms the core of sharing economy governance, this paper conceptually explores how the governance of sharing business models varies in terms of their dependence on developing social bonding and facilitating economic transaction, and how organizations strike a balance between the two mechanisms. A framework is presented that conceptualizes the variation between social bonding development and economic transaction facilitation. The framework offers a fine-grained explanation of the way in which sharing economy business models differ in terms of striking a balance between the relational association of sharing and the transactional association of economy. It provides a deeper understanding on the governance potential and tension of the hybrid intermediary organizations in an era of digitalization and complexity."
2019,"Collective Action Theories (CATs) Explaining the Sharing Economy The internet and new technologies give rise to the sharing economy. Here, resources are pooled and shared with a large base of people, commonly connected via platforms. Despite the growing prominence of the sharing economy, few attempts have been made to investigate the underlying foundations of platform organization and individual participation. Here, Collective Action Theories (CATs) offer a promising starting point. In this paper, we introduce four CATs and examine to which extent each of them helps explaining the organization of different sharing platforms as well as individual motivations to participate in it. For Second-Generation CATs, we exemplarily analyze the applicability to the sharing economy, before we draw general conclusions on all CATs. We conclude that despite of differences to the original contexts of CATs, they contain amazing conceptual similarities with the sharing economy. We foresee that most of the sharing economy can be explained by CATs, and with minor adaptations also the newly available technology."
2019,"Presentation of Self as Good and Right: How Values and Features are Linked in the Sharing Economy The sharing economy as an emerging field is characterized by unsettled debates about its shared purpose and defining characteristics of the organizations within this field. This study draws on neo-institutional theory to explore how sharing organizations position themselves vis--vis such debates with regard to (1) the values these organizations publicly promote to present themselves as good sharing organizations and (2) the business model features they make visible to appear as having the right organizational model. This study examines the online self-representations of 62 prototypical sharing organizations in Germany with regard to value propositions and business model features. A semantic network analysis of the features reveals two distinct categories of sharing organizations: grassroots initiatives and platform-based organizations. By showing how value propositions and business model features are linked in the sharing economy, the findings indicate the different legitimation strategies of grassroots initiatives and platform-based organizations, which we term sustainability by model and sustainability by feature. These findings broaden our understanding of the strategies that organizations apply to cope with societal expectations in the emerging sharing economy."
2019,"Hierarchy at Play: Governance as Balancing Act Researchers are increasingly interested in organizations that rely on their communities to create value, yet we still know little about how such organizations can both coordinate their members activities and nurture a sense of community among them at the same time. Based on comparative case analyses of 13 organizations in the sharing economy, this paper explores how organizations manage this balancing act through effective governance. Our findings suggest that they apply a set of three hierarchical governance practices: adventuring, harmonization, and gamification. A core theoretical contribution of our study is uncovering and theorizing how these practices build on and use language to enable effective governance in settings where the community is essential for stable value creation yet the structure of the community is inherently fragile. By showing how control and coordination practices are implemented and unfold, this study expands our understanding of governance in new forms of organizing."
2019,"Spanning Crisp Categories: Primary Category, Complementary Category, and Their Contrasts While research suggests that category schemas discourage hybridization, hybridization is a common production practice in many contexts (i.e., films, patents, and wineries). For producers in those contexts, the question is not about whether to span their primary categories, but about what categories to combine together. In this study, we shift attention from the degree of category spanning to the way in which categories are hybridized. Specifically, we examine whether crisp categories are likely to be combined with crisp or fuzzy categories, as well as the consequences of different combinations. Analyzing U.S. patent classes as technologic categories, we find that producers tend to hybridize crisp categories with crisp primary categories, particularly when they have accumulated more experience or work in larger teams. However, there is a discount for such hybrids, i.e., products that combines crisp categories together generate lower performance."
2019,"From the Margins to the Mainstream: The Expansion of a New Market Category within a Mature Field How mature fields are transformed is a longstanding question within organization studies. We study one process of field transformation: how theorization facilitates the creation and expansion of a new market category within a mature organizational field. Specifically, we study how the new category Canadian wine went from the margins to the mainstream of the wine market in Canada. For decades, large incumbents projected a European identity for their wines and deemphasized their Canadian roots. In contrast, small wineries adopted and projected a Canadian identity for their products by using Canadian names for their wines. We develop and test hypotheses for how theorization by entrepreneurs encouraged the expansion of this category of wine. In doing so, we contribute to our understanding of new category creation and expansion, field evolution, and the role of entrepreneurial theorization therein."
2019,"Authentic Adaptation as Response by De Novo Category Pioneers to De Alio Entrants In this qualitative study, I analyse how Studio X as co-pioneer in service design responds strategically when challenged by management consulting firms imitation of service design. As the firms success attracts de alio entrants with different skillsets, the firm finds itself increasingly under pressure to adhere to updated clients expectations. As exemplary firm at the core, Studio X follows the strategy of what I call authentic adaptation: distancing and adapting to new competition at the same time by embracing its art-inspired heritage whilst mimicking some of the de alio behaviours. I develop a grounded theory model on how the members of the firm begin to adapt the organisational form as a consequence of new market feedback, a huge departure from its original focus on the design community."
2019,"The Duality of Salient Exemplars for Prototype Evolution: The Creation of the Category AIDS Categories are cognitive structures that field participants to use to understand their environments. Category prototypes, which are the most representative part of a category, play an important role in the process of category emergence. However, previous studies on category emergence paid little attention to the role of prototype evolution. In particular, there is little research on how category prototypes are shaped by the inclusion or exclusion of heterogeneous exemplars. This process is important because some exemplars have more salient features than others and carry stronger socio-cultural meanings. In order to shed light on this understudied process, we draw on an inductive study of how medical professionals constructed the novel category AIDS from 1978 to 1985. In contrast to the existing literature which views prototypes as functional for the classification process, we find that prototypes based on salient exemplars are a double-edged sword. The early focus on salient exemplars might facilitate identifying the emergence of a new category. However, later on the same salient exemplars create biases which hinder the inclusion of less salient exemplars, particularly ones that have socio-cultural meanings that conflict with the emerging prototype. We thus show that the categorization process is messier and more non-linear than assumed in prior studies. More generally our study expands the existing literature by integrating theories of materiality and socio-cultural meanings into categorization theory."
2019,"Dimensional Models of Organization Structure: A Meta-Analysis of their Contemporary Relevance Dimensional models of organization structure were once a mainstay of organization theory, but theorists now debate the relevance of these models in the current era of new organization forms. In this article, the question of contemporary relevance was the focus of a meta-analysis of research on dimensional organization structure published between 1958 and 2018. After framing the theoretical debate, a narrative review surveyed structural dimensions conceptualized in four founding models inspired by Max Webers bureaucratic ideal type and distilled a summary model consisting of five structural dimensions: formalization, standardization, specialization, centralization, and vertical differentiation. Meta-analytic comparisons of subgroups from a sample of 435 correlations published between 1958 and 1989 with equivalent subgroups from a sample of 365 correlations published between 1990 and 2018 indicated substantially reduced levels of intercorrelation among the structural dimensions over time. These results were interpreted as casting doubt on the contemporary relevance of dimensional structural models as originally conceptualized."
2019,"Organization Design for Coordination and Cooperation: Model Analysis and Behavioral Experiment While organization design has been a central topic in management and organization research, our knowledge is still limited on how it affects organizational processes and their consequences in the problem of collective action, since past studies have treated the two facets of the problem, coordination and cooperation, separately. Here, we introduce organization design models as a combination of coordination and cooperation problems and conduct a model analysis and lab experiment to show that organization design is a determinant of successful collective action. Specifically, we compare individual behaviors and organizational outcomes under an organization design wherein individuals engage in the cooperation problem first and coordination second and a design wherein the coordination problem is tackled first and cooperation second. The results from the lab experiment indicate that individual behaviors under the latter type of organization design are more efficiently coordinated and more effectively motivate cooperation, thereby resulting in more desirable organizational outcomes. This suggests that, in practice, managers can improve organizational performance by (re-)designing the division of labor and integration processes."
2019,"Transaction Cost Economics & Mutual Uncertainty as a Governance Mechanism The central premise of transaction cost economics (TCE) is that parties select governance mechanisms to mitigate the hazards of opportunism while economizing on the costs of more complex forms of governance. However, boundedly rational actors face meaningful limitations on their foresight which constrains their ability to negotiate complete contractual terms. TCE largely treats contractual incompleteness as a problem that parties eliminate whenever cost considerations allow. The theory developed here argues that under certain conditions, contractual incompleteness serves as a commitment strategy that enables contracting parties to ensure mutual dependence within their overall relationship. Parties that employ a commitment strategy through incompleteness mutually accept the risk of an unfavorable outcome based upon an interpretation of the incomplete language imposed by a third party. Thus, contractual incompleteness constitutes a shared commitment to avoid such an imposed resolution and adapt the relationship to unforeseen or unlikely future events."
2019,"Tight or Loose  An Integrative Perspective on Organizational Structures of Renewal Extant literature distinguishes between two perspectives that make different assumptions about the effect of structure on firm performance: One emphasizes the value of tight interdependencies, the other advocates for loose interdependencies. We find that these literatures build on a common assumption that structure hinders organizational adaptation. Based on an in-depth case study of a software company with 30 years of successful history, we show how a combination of tight and loose coupling  a tightly coupled activity system aligned around loose discretion-inducing elements  can facilitate strategic renewal. We propose an integrative perspective that provides a more complete picture on how organizational structures affect adaptation. This perspective recognizes that organizational structures can enable individual and interpersonal behaviors that aggregate into a firm-level capacity for continuous renewal."
2019,"Punishment and Institutions: A Macro-Foundations Perspective In this paper, we adopt a macro-foundations perspective to explore punishment within institutional theory. Institutional theorists have long focused on a singular type of punishment  retribution  including the use of sanctions, fines, and incarceration to maintain conformity. We expand the types of punishment that work to uphold institutions, organized by visible and hidden and formal and informal characteristics. The four types of punishment include: (1) punishment-as-retribution, (2) punishment-as-charivari, (3) punishment-as-rehabilitation, and (4) punishment-as-vigilantism. We develop important connections between punishment-as-charivari, which relies on shaming efforts, and burgeoning interest in organizational stigma and social evaluations. We also point to informal types of punishment, including punishment-as-vigilantism, to expand the variety of actors that punish wrongdoing, including actors without the legal authority to do so. Finally, we detail a number of questions for each type of punishment as a means to generate a future research agenda."
2019,"Civil Responses to Repression and the Emergence of Challengers: Civilian Murders by Sicilian Mafia How do group challengers emerge under a repressive institution? This study examines how extreme forms of repression prompt collective resistance. We suggest that extreme forms of repression trigger intense emotion, which alters actors rational choice to be inactive and leads them to engage in collective action. We further argue that large gatherings that are flared up as a response to extreme repression will provide an avenue to build an active sense of collective engagement, creating conditions for more organized efforts to establish organizations that fight against the illegitimate institution. We test our hypotheses using the case of the Sicilian Mafia in the city of Palermo, Italy in 1981-2011. Results show that murders of civilian activists by the Mafia influence the occurrences of collective civic action such as processions, sit-ins, concerts, and strikes, especially in the vicinity of the sites of the murders. Furthermore, results also support our prediction that these local collective events facilitate the establishment of anti-mafia organizations in the area. Focusing on the reactive nature of social movements, this study contributes to literature on movements and organizations by explaining how contentious behavior rises under structural constraints that hinder it and how it eventually leads to changes of the stable institution."
2019,"Breaking News: Media Coverage and the Growth of Terrorist Organizations Terrorist organizations are proliferating and growing in lethality worldwide. To combat the proliferation of terror organizations calls for insights from organizational research. Drawing on the insight from organization and strategy research that emphasizes the effect of information intermediaries on organizational outcomes, we study whether media attention to terrorist attacks has inadvertently fueled the growth of terrorist organizations in the past few decades. We collect novel data on media attention to terrorist organizations and employ an instrumental variable approach stemming from the coincidence of natural disasters with attacks which generates exogenous variation in the amount of media attention to terrorist attacks. We find that terrorist groups whose past attacks garner more media attention are significantly more active, ceteris paribus, than groups that experience concurrent disasters that diverted media attention away. Our tests of group resources further suggest that resource acquisition may be one important way whereby media attention influences the future development of terrorist groups. Finally, the significant effect of media attention seems to be persistent over time."
2019,"Tracing the (Un)holy Trinity of Legitimacy: A Longitudinal Study of the Legitimation of Torture How was it possible that one of Americas most prominent government agencies resorted to torture when interrogating terror suspects in the 2000s? And how is it possible that torture continues to be discussed and practiced as a legitimate means to acquire information? We address these questions by conducting a longitudinal case study of the CIAs Detention and Interrogation Program. Drawing on rich archival data, we show how the advocates of torture mobilized the desirable ends of national security to justify a hitherto illegitimate means. By doing so, advocates were able to mobilize support by experts, to stifle the sway of moral principles, and to recategorize torture as efficient, enhanced and thus legitimate interrogation techniques. While our study draws on an unconventional setting, it has critical implications for organization theory. Specifically, our research elucidates that legitimacy is grounded in different legitimacy criteria (consequential, principle-based, and regulatory) which constitute a dynamic configuration of mutually dependent relationships. In our context, key actors within the CIA employed a set of strategies (validation, recategorization, and theorization) to construe torture as legitimate. Conceptualizing legitimacy as the strategic balancing of different criteria adds depth and nuance to existing legitimacy research which previously has assumed that legitimacy criteria are fixed and audience-specific."
2019,"Politics in the Aftermath of Disaster: A Marginal Community Attempting to Shape Institutional Change Industrial disasters can unsettle taken for granted assumptions in an organizational field and can trigger attempts for institutional change. Yet such attempts are likely to be contested between different groups of actors who seek to promote their perspective of event definition, causes, and required solutions. There is mixed evidence when marginal actors succeed in driving institutional change or when powerful actors impose their perspective, and it is unclear what enables marginal actors to change the conversation. We conducted a qualitative analysis into the activities of how the marginal Human Factors community in the North Sea offshore oil and gas industry attempted to influence field-level learning in the drilling engineering community in the wake of the Macondo disaster. However, their strategies were mainly directed at influencing interpretations and knowledge and failed to achieve integration and institutionalization. Our study indicates the need for marginal communities to maintain awareness of potential institutional constraints such as institutionalized values, discourses, and learning mechanisms and responsibilities."
2019,"Living on Shaky Ground: Organizing for Resilience under Conditions of Institutional Volatility In this article, we explore how organizations cope with repeated and significant discontinuities in their institutional environment  an empirical condition that characterizes many societies in Latin-America, Africa and the Middle-East beyond the well-studied Western nations of the Global North. In so doing, we introduce the concept of institutional volatility, as a matter of degree, to characterize institutional environments where institutional infrastructure precariousness lead to a high likelihood of continued  both endogenously and exogenously triggered  and significant socio-political and socio-economic change. After explaining how institutional volatility is triggered as sustained over time in these environments, we explore its consequences by conceptualizing how it this lack of stability may lead to what we christen fluid configurations at the field-level of analysis. Lastly, we explore how different organizations embedded in these fields and societies may resort to resilience as a potential coping mechanism against this enduring instability. At its core, our article examines four central propositions that assess the manifestation and consequences of institutional resilience as an organizational-level response strategy to institutional volatility. We critically evaluate the broader implications of such a perspective on the relationship between institutions and organizations, stress some core contributions of our work, and outline a future research agenda."
2019,"The More Things Change the More They Stay the SameVariability in Discrimination after Salient Events One of the persistent questions in the social sciences is why economic discrimination continues despite legal and social pressure to act in an egalitarian fashion. In this work, we propose and test a contributing mechanism that has yet to be considered in the prior literature, namely that individuals biases toward others may manifest to a greater or lesser degree over time, depending on the salience, and thus attention paid to others group membership, e.g., race. Thus, we propose that acts of economic discrimination may be more sensitive to environmental conditions than prior theory would suggest. In support of this proposition, we offer a combination of observational and experimental evidence. First, we consider high-profile events involving interracial violence against African Americans in the United States, treating their occurrence as a quasi-experiment, to identify their effect on entrepreneurial fundraising outcomes for crowdfunding campaigns conducted on Kickstarter. Here, we pay particular attention to the moderating influence of entrepreneur race. Second, we implement a controlled experiment, wherein we prime racial salience for a random subset of subjects, exposing them to information in the news about a salient event of racial discrimination. Subsequently, we assess subjects perceptions of crowdfunding campaigns and the organizing entrepreneurs, along various dimensions of quality, as a joint function of priming and the race of a randomly assigned entrepreneur, holding the campaign content constant. Our findings indicate that racially salient events depress evaluations of entrepreneur quality and monetary contribution to African-American founders, relative to non-African American founders."
2019,"Unintended Consequences: Institutional Work and the Inadvertent Maintenance of Grand Challenges This paper demonstrates why and how well-intentioned efforts to address societys grand challenges can lead to unintended consequences that inadvertently entrench and further those same challenges. Drawing on a case study of how activists sought to reverse Japans declining birth rates by challenging existing gender roles and marriage norms, we show how well-intentioned but fragmented forms of institutional work lead to both the co-optation of original change efforts, and an absence of public arenas for contestation and debate. This combination of co-optation and low contestation resulted in the legitimation and diffusion of new meanings that reified  rather than challenged  pre-existing gender roles and marriage norms that underpin the countrys demographic challenges. Employing our context as a revelatory case, we exemplify how field-level conditions can lead even the most well-intentioned forms of institutional to negative unintended outcomes. Our findings contribute to the literature on institutional work and institutional change by highlighting the mechanisms that underlie mission drift and unintentional consequences. More broadly, they also highlight the difficulties and dangers of trying to address highly complex grand challenges through proactive institutional work efforts."
2019,"Being, Doing and Becoming: Organizational Identity Work and the Process of Managing Exogenous Shocks Organizational studies struggle to explain the processes through which organizational identities are created and re-created through time. The main reasons for this rests in the disagreements about the manner in which the identity of organizations has been theorized. That is, organizational identity has been limited by theoretical approaches that are built on individual perceptions about a specific time in a specific place. This paper, instead, focuses on how exogenous organizational shocks initiate processes of identity work. Our empirical site is a sample of bars and restaurants that were affected by the implementation of anti-smoking laws. Based on eight (8) distinct case studies, we argue that different types of organizational identities beget corresponding identity work. Our paper links organizational identity to identity work, in terms of how being informs doing and becoming for organizations managing an important exogenous shock."
2019,"Craft Work and the Social Imaginary of Organized Making This paper contributes to understanding how the social imaginary of organized craft work is constructed. The social imaginary enables the practices of a society by providing an interpretive means through which people imagine their social surroundings and develop common understandings. The analysis draws on Taylors (2004) concept of the social imaginary to understand the craft revival that has taken place in Western cultures in the past decade. Using empirical examples, it is proposed that this social imaginary is comprised of five dimensions: imagined communities, imagined places, imagined persons, imagined histories and imagined traditions. The paper shows how these five dimensions form the basis for constructing and contesting the authenticity of craft work. It concludes by drawing attention to the importance of the social imaginary of craft work in establishing a moral order. Specifically, it is argued that the current craft revival reflects a cultural shift away from a version of modernity based on values of rationalization and scientific, technological progress, towards more embedded, embodied conceptions of meaningful work."
2019,"A Temporal View of Tie Formation: Exploring the Role of the Future through a Situated View of Events This paper complements social network theory with theoretical and methodological insights from strong process theory in order to provide a temporal view of tie formation. I follow processes of tie formation unfolding among 15 organizations participating in a collaborative innovation workshop through a longitudinal, qualitative case study. Adopting a situated view contributes to our understanding of how interorganizational network dynamics emerge from the ways in which individual actors purposively enact network ties. While previous research has mostly focused on the role of past ties for tie formation, I describe how actors imagine future ties and work towards them. I find the distant future and past to be important for the forming of new and reactivation of past ties, whereas the near future and past are more focused on the maintenance of ties. The implications provide guidance to practitioners engaged in collaborative processes of innovation and entrepreneurship."
2019,"How Frontliners Enact Strategy: Role of Visual Digital Artifacts in Strategy Realization Process The scholarship on the role of visual material artifacts and how frontliners enact strategy in organizations is maturing. This paper aims to contribute to this stream of research through a qualitative empirical interpretive study of strategy work within an organization, with a focus on how frontliners employed digital maps as visualizing artifacts within the strategy realization process. Our findings show thatfirst they see the strategy and then they do the strategythe digital visualizing artifacts serve as the strategy equivalent of night vision goggles. Thus, our study extends the literature in two ways. First, we highlight how the strategy is rendered seeable via tangibility affordances and then doable via actionability affordances of these strategy visualizing artifacts. Second, we show that strategy realization process is underpinned by two influence mechanisms which may be top-down whereby legibility of strategy is supported by artifact affordances lending enhanced meaningfulness to the strategy consistent with its original formulation; or bottom-up influence mechanism whereby enunciability of strategy is boosted by artifact affordances enabling reinterpretation of strategy beyond the original scope."
2019,"Caught Between a Rock & a Hard Place: How Spatial Facets of Refugee Crisis Shape Institutional Work The institutional work scholarship has come of age and is starting to pay closer attention to the role of materiality and particularly the contribution of spatiality to institutional change. In this paper we aim to contribute to the latter stream of research. We focus on the institutional evolution of illegality of refugee employment and the associated displacement phenomenon in the Eastern Mediterranean (i.e., refugees who fled since the start of Syrian civil strife and arrived as well as gradually settled in Lebanon). Our findings point to the salient role of spatial facets of the refugee crisis, i.e., scattered-ness of population throughout the host country territory and drastic increase in density of refugees relative to the local population and the country land mass. We provide evidence that, these spatial facets shaped the institutional work of actors to bring about a change in the illegality of refugee employment institution  affording opportunities for maintaining (demonizing) and disrupting (undermining assumptions, dissociating sanctions) the latter institution. We also show that, there is a contradictory dynamic, that is, the same spatial facets can effectively trigger opposing institutional work tendencies albeit in an unpredictable and an emergent manner. Our work extends the institutional work literature by highlighting a mechanism of influence on how spatial facets of displacement (refugee crisis) shape the underlying institutional work and how these same spatial facets can unleash contradictory practices of institutional work."
2019,"What Doesnt Kill You Makes You Stronger: Identity Change in Response to Territorial Threat In this ethnographic study of a social services organization Better World located in a Western Canadian city, we build on the organizations response to a geographical disruption in order to explore the dynamics between place and organizational identity. We conceptualize the organizations current place, their home of three decades, as their territory and ask, how do place-oriented environmental disruptions influence organizational identity change? Building on an inductive and interpretive analysis of rich qualitative data, we develop the notion of organizational territoriality, defined as an organizations actions aimed at asserting control over a place, with the objective of managing externalities and other organizational outcomes, including organizational identity creation, sustenance, or change. In our case, organizational territoriality manifested through several forms of organizational identity work over time, which in turn altered the organizations identity."
2019,"With No Strings Attached: Insurgent Uses and the Turnaround of the Electric Guitar Industry With this study I aim to shed light on how artefacts and their symbolic meanings become altered through unintended and unwished, hence, insurgent uses. I problematize the multiplicity of an artefacts possible uses by a case in which both symbolic and material practices challenged the institutional integrity of the manufacturers of the very artefacts and mobilized novel macro-cultural understandings which enabled the emergence of a new organizational subfield. Empirically, I venture into the field of the electric guitars, amplifiers and effect boxes. By means of an historical case study, I spotlight the institutional transformation ignited by the rebellious guitarists of the late 1960s in the backdrop of the cultural countermovement. I argue that insurgent uses gain institutional momentum by rocking both, the technological-material and the socio-symbolic realm. The case highlights that insurgent uses transformed the electric guitars symbolic and functional affordances and the fields meaning systems via three mutually reinforcing concurrencies. Namely, by bringing forward new affordances for practices, second, by disrupting values and role identities, and third, by converting the cultural context of musical production and consumption. Thereby the insurgent uses shifted the interpretative schemes on the field level and led eventually to an altered understanding and conception of the electric guitar."
2019,"It's not that Obvious! When Do Interorganizational Big Data Technologies Allow Cooperative Dynamics? Organizations increasingly employ big data technologies to mediate their collaboration processes. This enables the faster exchange of complex and voluminous data, allowing more complex interorganizational routines of coordination and control. As technology is not deterministic but applied by knowledgeable actors in idiosyncratic settings, the effects on interaction dynamics are unclear. With this qualitative comparative analysis of 13 case relationships, I explore how configurations of relationship antecedent and technology set-up conditions lead to cooperative or non-cooperative interaction dynamics. I find three causal configurations supporting cooperative interaction dynamics and three causal configurations supporting non-cooperative interaction dynamics. This typology of technology set-up and relationship antecedent conditions contributes to the alliance literature by showing how interorganizational big data technologies can create transparency or opacity, and learning symmetry or asymmetry between partners, and how these different organizational powers affect interaction dynamics. It further contributes to resource dependence theory by disentangling the effects of control exertion and bargaining power asymmetries on interaction dynamics."
2019,"Orchestrating Inter-Organizational Networks to Deliver Megaprojects Inter-organizational networks have been of increasing interest to management scholars with studies exploring network evolution and structure. More recently, research has begun to consider the role of a network orchestrator in setting up inter-organizational networks. However, prior research has largely neglected to examine the role of network orchestrator in development, structure, and governance of network. Our study addresses this gap by examining in detail the drivers and activities behind the development, structure, and governance of inter-organizational networks. We empirically focus on the activities and processes through which a large, multinational energy company orchestrates inter-organizational networks in a megaproject. These networks are vital in delivering services for a $25 billion nuclear power plant in the UK. More specifically, we analyze two inter-organizational networks, collecting rich primary and secondary dataset including interviews, site visits, meeting observations, as well as company and government documents. Findings show that in the process of setting up inter-organizational networks, the network orchestrator encounters three types of complexities: vertical, horizontal, and task. These complexities influence the network orchestrators decisions pertaining to the network development, structure, and governance. Moreover, by focusing on the intentional development of network and coordinating its activities, the study contributes to the emerging research on network orchestration. This study offers one of the first empirical studies to unpack key activities of a network orchestrator (in collaboration with network members) in setting up inter-organizational networks. We found that while decisions pertaining to the development and structure of the network ultimately arrived at the same final decision, the governance mode decisions varied across the investigated cases."
2019,"Strategic Balance of Asymmetric Interdependence and Cross-Border Mergers & Acquisitions This study contributes to resource dependence theory (RDT) and mergers and acquisitions (M&As;) research by examining the nonlinear effect of cohesion on cross-border M&As.; We synthesizes the logic of power and the logic of embeddedness to examine how different levels of cohesion between an actor and its partner influence the actors constraint absorption strategies, leading to strategic balance of asymmetric interdependence. Using a sample of 56 industries during 2000-2014 in the United States collected from World Input-Output Tables (WIOT) and Securities Data Corporation (SDC), we find an inverted U-shaped relationship between cohesion (i.e., the synthesis of the logic of power and the logic of embeddedness) and cross-border M&As.; Meanwhile, the above relationship is negatively moderated by actors power advantage."
2019,"The Role of Boundary Organizations in Collaborations between Incumbent Firms and Start-ups This paper investigates how boundary organizations enable and assist collaborations between incumbent firms and start-ups. This particular type of inter-organizational collaborations is puzzling, in that on the surface they are potentially fruitful for both parties, yet difficult to build and manage, and frequently result in a fiasco. Through a field study on an open innovation programme involving a former venture accelerator, an established leader company in the fashion industry, and a group of high-tech start-ups, this paper illustrates three processes through which boundary organizations enable and assist collaborations at the boundary between incumbent firms and start-ups, across organizational as well as disciplinary boundaries: (i) cross-domain framing work, (ii) misaligned translation work, and (iii) collective orchestration work. Our analysis also delineate the implications of such processes for the collaborating firms which, in turn, facilitate the execution of experimental collaboration projects, and lead to the emergence of new business opportunities. Our findings promote a dynamic, processual view of the morphing role of boundary organizations in inter-organizational collaborations, and have implications for theory and future research on boundary organizations, collaboration processes between incumbent firms and start-ups, and the emerging role of accelerators in open innovation."
2019,"Acting in a Dynamic World: Pragmatism and Routine Dynamics Inspired by the writings of classical pragmatists, we propose a process model of routine enactment that takes seriously the processual nature and the inherent indeterminacy of organizational routines. Our model integrates and extends scholarly understanding of routine enactment and internal dynamics by taking into account the interplay between cognition, habit, and emotion as routines unfold. Moreover, by bringing temporality and creativity into the internal dynamics of routines the model highlights an image of routines as constantly in the making, perpetually becoming. That is, routine participants continuously reconstruct their present activities in the face of emergent, uncertain situations that challenge their progress toward their active goals. This reconstruction can be likened to a creative process during which participants act intelligently by merging the past and the future into the present to maintain ongoing activities and potentially revise the routine. In our view, the reconstruction of a routine is not an exceptional occurrence or an epiphenomenon of routine stability, but an inherent characteristic of the nature of all routines."
2019,"Replicating Routines through ICTs: Enacting Complementary Patterns of Augmentation and Adjustment The replication of routines has been a central theme explaining the rapid expansion of service deliveries. The adoption of information communication technologies (ICTs) provides an opportunity to replicate service delivery routines, posing practical and theoretical challenges especially salient in healthcare. This study draws on the capabilities perspective and practice perspective to address how are routines replicated to deliver services to multiple geographic locations? This study draws on an in-depth, longitudinal qualitative research examining the replication of geriatric clinical services comparing the delivery through telehealth at four residential aged care facilities with the traditional face-to-face delivery in a hospital. We advance the literature on the replication of routines by developing an integrative model explaining routine recreation. Routine recreation comprises two ostensive patterns: augmentation (extending the existing geriatric service routine) and adjustment (adapting to unintended consequences of the telehealth service routine). We discuss how our findings provide new insights regarding technology-mediated work flows in light of new interdependencies distributed across multiple locations."
2019,"Configuring Routines: How Interdependence Is Enacted among Routines in Complex Ecologies I investigate interdependence among routines, including how such interdependence is produced and how it shapes and is shaped by unfolding dynamics in an organizations ecology of routines. Drawing on ethnographic data from a two-year study of doctors hospital admissions work, I analyze the processes of configuring multiple routines into various configurations in service to specific projects (i.e., patients). At any given time, a significant number of configurations are taking shape and developing in a dynamic ecology that I characterize as a continuously evolving configuration of configurations. Consequently, the becoming of any one configuration is entangled with that of many others. I identify four causal processes that enact interdependence emergently out of dynamics internal and external to the evolving configuration. My process theory contributes to emerging work on the dynamics of routine ecologies, situating routine-level actions in the unfolding dynamics not only of task-interrelated routines, but also of other consequential organizational action patterns."
2019,"How Core Actors Coordinate Distal Actors in Organizational Routines This paper develops novel theory on how core actors coordinate actions of distal actors in organizational routines. While core actors have experience in executing the routine, distal actors do not. We explore microlevel practices core actors use to tie distal actors into the overall routine performance to ensure robust routine performances. We use unique video, photo, and written ethnographic data from live maritime search and rescue (SAR) missions, where an experienced SAR crew saved refugees in the Aegean Sea. We identify microlevel practicessuch as verbal and body languagecore actors use to coordinate the collective actions of themselves and distal actors in joint routine performances. Based on these insights, we develop a process model on how core actors coordinate actions of distal actors to maintain robust routine performances. By focusing on core and distal routine participants, our study expands the literature on organizational routines into an important and largely overlooked direction. It also provides new insights into the role of verbal and body language as microlevel practices in routine performances, thereby improving theoretical consistency regarding the importance of language for organizing work between routine research and broader management theory."
2019,"The Death of a Bundle of Organizational Routines Much has been written about why organizations die. Some research focuses on how the process of organizational death unfolds (e.g. Sutton, 1987). In contrast little research or conceptual work focuses on how organizational processes die. Organizational routines are acknowledged as key organizational processes. Our qualitative field study of the death of a bundle of entangled organizational routines is used to develop a process model to explain the death of organizational routines. This model adds to existing organizational literature by focusing specifically on the death of an organizational process rather than birth or growth. Additionally, it expands our understanding of the dynamics of bundles of routines and addresses the unexplored theoretical puzzle of how entangled routines are held together despite actors in one routine being ignorant of actions in interrelated routines."
2019,"Seeking Socially Innovative Solutions to Complex Social Problems Our study builds on a growing line of research in management and organizational studies examining responses to grand challenges and complex social problems. We investigate how a rugby team in a high- security prison in Argentina has dramatically reduced recidivism and managed to survive and thrive for almost a decade. We draw our analysis upon the anthropological concept of naturalizing analogy to understand how this prison initiative is simultaneously bridging different institutional domains, operating at individual and collective levels, and opening up prisoners to new meaning structures, emotional dispositions, and ways of behaving and organizing. The findings from our ethnographic case study reveal three reinforcing mechanisms in the naturalizing of an analogy - resonating, resignifying and elaborating. They offer a new conceptual scaffolding that is foundational to institutional theorizing of how change is reified, naturalized and made meaningful."
2019,"The Role of Analogy in the Implementation of Distant Alternatives for Path-breaking Change Analogies are powerful tools for generating distant alternatives, but the analogies role in the implementation of those alternatives has been unclear. In our study we chose a longitudinal, interpretative approach to investigate how analogies impact the resource allocation process from initiating to structurally separating the new alternative from the existing business to allow for path-breaking change. Our study of a winter sports equipment producer from the Austrian Alps starting to developing and producing aircraft components reveals that the change of the analogy over time was critical to the implementation of the distant alternative. The analogy change process that depicts the centerpiece of our resulting process model, explains how analogies are (1) retrieved, (2) expanded, (3) symmetrized, and (4) trimmed in response to market feedback. Our findings also show the internal and external conditions that explain why a distant analogy is selected in the first place and reveal the self-fulfilling tendencies of working with a distant analogy: the relatedness of the existing business with a distant domain that has been initially constructed by the analogy might become factual (e.g., patents in the new domain) when choosing the analogy for implementation."
2019,"A Cognitive and Analogical Approach to the Market Competitiveness of Social Enterprises In this paper, I experimentally test the influence of goal-based categorization and categorical analogy on the perceived competitiveness of social enterprises, which are hybrid organizations with a dual social and business mission. When a social enterprise emphasizes its business mission first (commercial-social hybrid), the organization improves its perceived competitiveness when goal-based categorization is activated in the evaluators mind, meaning they perform goal-derived conceptual combinations and rely on a piecemeal cognitive mechanism based on the evaluators goal. However, when a social enterprise emphasizes its social mission first (social-commercial hybrid), the organization improves its perceived competitiveness when categorical analogy is activated in the evaluators mind, meaning they use a holistic cognitive mechanism that establishes a relational mapping of the hybrid venture with a typical venture. This work contributes to the literature on categorization in markets, hybrid organizations and differentiation in markets."
2019,"The Role of Institutional Fields in Entrepreneurial Emergence and Venture Mortality While many western economies today make notable investments in the development of systems of entrepreneurship to support the survival of entrepreneurial ventures, the mortality rate remains high. To explore the problem of high mortality of young ventures, I examine the role of entrepreneurial systems in shaping organisational emergence. I conceptualize the entrepreneurial system as an institutional field and explore the role of both the logic and the infrastructure of the field in the emergence of the new organisations. Empirically, I study a group of ventures that, despite their demographic homogeneity and shared origins in a single entrepreneurial accelerator, came to reflect different entrepreneurial forms. Using multiple comparative case analysis, I identify four different entrepreneurial forms, of which one exhibits higher levels of mortality than the others. I argue that the heterogeneous forms reflect variations in both the logic and the institutional infrastructure of the field of the emergent organisations. The findings contribute to the understanding of emergence by elaborating the roles of both micro-level entrepreneurial action and the institutional order of the entrepreneurial system. For practitioners and policymakers of entrepreneurship, the study highlights the impact of entrepreneurial systems on the mortality of emergent entrepreneurial ventures."
2019,"Rising from the Ashes: How Ventures use Moralizing Narratives to Reform and Tackle Legitimacy Crises In their quest for growth, new ventures often engage in norm-breaking behavior that triggers a legitimacy crisis among a key audience. However, it is unclear how new ventures can actually reform substantively their norm-breaking core values and practices to address such a legitimacy crisis. In particular, we explore whether and how new ventures can employ narratives to reform internally and tackle a legitimacy crisis. To do so we conducted an in-depth case study of the successful reform process undertaken by a Fintech venture whose survival was threatened by a legitimacy crisis with the financial regulator. Our study articulates a complex process of new venture reforming in which moralizing narratives (cathartic and edifying) enable major reforms of the ventures norm-breaking core values and key practices over time, abating and then resolving the legitimacy crisis. We articulate several ways in which our study contributes to scholarship on new venture legitimation and narratives."
2019,"Decaying State, Crumbling Society: Illicit Violence and Private Business in Rural China Transitional China offers an ideal opportunity for scholars to examine an important yet understudied topic  the relationship between entrepreneurship and extensive social change. Using a national sample survey of private business owners in 1,209 Chinese villages, we found that villains as actors of illicit violence significantly reduced a rural businesss income. Moreover, this negative effect was stronger if (1) the village administration requisitioned more agricultural lands; (2) the business owner was female; or (3) the business owner was an outsider (i.e., was not born in the village). These findings are consistent with our argument that local Chinese state has decayed as it relies on illicit violence to execute its predatory agenda, and that social control has considerably weakened in rural China when more male adults migrate to cities for work. Our study illuminates the emerging gangster capitalism in post-socialist China, deep challenges faced by Chinese state and society, and more generally, the intricate relationship between the state, private business, and illicit violence."
2019,"Turning Antagonists into Supporters: Establishing Legitimacy in Hostile Environments This study gives insights into how new ventures can establish legitimacy in hostile environments, where a large number of audiences carry pre-existing negative views of an organizations activities or agenda. Based on the case of how a new social venture in Egypt gathered support from stakeholders, who were highly skeptical and even suspicious of the organization from the onset, we identify a new model of legitimacy building that is particularly applicable to hostile environments: optimal deviance. We show how optimal deviance enables a new venture, whose agenda is perceived to be inherently incompatible with existing institutional norms, to establish its deviance in a way that appears as non-threatening and inoffensive to key audiences. Our study has implications for research on new venture legitimacy and social entrepreneurship."
2019,"The Community Ecology of Concepts This study builds on sociological and cognitive science to explain why conceptssuch as product or technology classes, organizational forms, professions, and genres of artare used more or less often by audiences to categorize objects in a domain. We argue that concepts populate a semantic space where cooperative and competitive relations arise based on spatial proximity and hierarchical linkage. We hypothesize that concepts are more often used by audiences for categorizing objects when they are moderately distant from their superordinate concept, or root, and maximally distant from other sub-concepts of the same root. We find support for our theoretical arguments in an analysis of genre and sub-genre concepts' usage on a crowdsourced music database."
2019,"(In)Congruence in Organizations Positions in the Product Market and Audience Classification Scheme This study examines how audiences attention and consensus on organizations depend on the extent that organizations' positions in product markets are congruent with audiences' classification schemes. We argue that organizations first select positions in the product market relative to their competitors. To easily interpret organizations positions, audiences classify organizations into categories that may not perfectly reflect product market configurations. Organizations' positions in the product market may differ from their classification for at least three reasons. First, audiences may choose comparison sets for reasons unrelated to organizations' competitive landscape. Second, there could be delays in reclassifying organizations movements in the product market. Finally, macro-level market changes can lead to incongruence. We argue that incongruence in the two positions of organizations will result in increased attention by audience members as well as disagreement between audience members as they try to reconcile organizations positions into extant classification schemes. We test our argument in the setting of security analysts evaluations of publicly listed firms in the United States between 1996-2013. Results show that changes in the number of security analysts earnings forecasts and dispersion of their forecasts increased when organizations had incongruent positions in the product market and in analysts coverage structures."
2019,"Moving Beyond Labels: Text, Images and Biases in Categorization Recent research has emphasized that signaling clear membership in product categories influences how products perform. In this paper we focus on two shortcomings in the categorization literature. First, while prior literature has focused primarily on category labels as signals of categorical membership, other mechanisms that communicate association to a categorysuch as semantic networks and imageshave been under-researched. We draw on the literature on multi-modal processing of information to explain how text-based mechanisms such as the use of labels and semantic networks differ from visual-based mechanisms such as the use of images. Second, the prior literature has overlooked the asymmetry in the effect of positive and negative labels on performance. We draw on an extensive literature within psychology to argue that negative labels have a stronger effect on performance than positive labels. Using original data from the crowdfunding website Indiegogo from 2010 to 2015, we find that both text-based mechanisms, semantic networks and labels, and visual mechanisms of signaling category membership are associated with performance. Our findings also suggest that images convey category membership by activating different cognitive structures than text. Furthermore, we find that labels with negative valence have a stronger effect on performance than positive labels. Our study theorizes and provides empirical support for a more complete understanding of how producers can signal categorical membership to shape the performance of their products."
2019,"All that Rhythm of Identity Propagation: At the Nexus of Intersubjective Sensemaking Arenas How do new ventures use labels to attract greater attention and subsequently institutional legitimacy? This study takes a modified evolutionary view of the nascent markets online conversation, in which allocation of attention to ventures occurs at the nexus of emergent vs. institutionalized arenas of intersubjective sensemaking. The key is to combine labels of varying semantic properties in the right place (i.e., arena) at the right time to navigate the tension between the crowd and the news media. The predictions are tested in a study of 1,395 ventures receiving media attention and external funding in the context of 38 million social media posts and 4 million news articles about the Internet of Things (IoT) between July 2009 and March 2017. The results show that the winning strategy is to use what the news media pick up from the crowds ongoing conversation at time t+1, and what the crowd repeats after the news medias such sensemaking efforts at time t+2. Both times, institutional discourse is infused with semantic novelty to keep the conversation fresh and interesting in the eyes of external audiences. Subsequently, a ventures rise in market prominence among the news media is shown to positively influence its perceived value potential in the eyes of seed-stage institutional investors. Overall, the study suggests that temporary intersections of the crowds semantic variationi.e., a force for changeand the news medias selective retentioni.e., a force for continuityprovide a useful sounding board for a young firm's successful identity change."
2019,"The Impact of Collaborative Failure on Persistence and Course Adjustment of Dyadic Relationships Although Failed collaborations constitute a significant subset of all collaborative work, our knowledge of the impact of failure on the social interactions of project participants, particularly at the basic level of a dyad, remains limited. This study explores the conditions under which dyadic ties in failed collaborative projects persist and reappear within a future project. Using the context of the motion picture industry and focusing on movie flops, we examine the role of dyad homophily and collaboration history on the probability of dyadic tie persistence. Results indicate that while dyad homophily is a far more powerful predictor of future collaboration in failed projects compared to successful projects, there is no significant difference between the predictive power of dyad collaboration history in failed and successful projects. We also examine the nature of future repeated collaborations and find that the dyad partners tend to distance themselves from the old crew and the market niches of the old failed project. Implications for literatures on interpersonal tie persistence and learning from failure in social contexts are discussed."
2019,"Attention Disorders in Organizations, Incompetence Traps and Business Failure Advancing the attention-based view (ABV), we define attention disorders in organizations as systematic tendencies to misallocate attention to goals (i.e., the temporal dimension), interests (i.e., the spatial dimension), outcomes (i.e., the effectual dimension) and/or trends (i.e., the directional dimension). We identify the following attention disorders: (1) learning myopia - neglecting long-term goals, global interests, failing outcomes or emerging trends; (2) learning hyperopia - neglecting short-term goals, local interests, successful outcomes or current trends; (3) learning astigmatism  neglecting both short-term goals and long-term goals, local interests and global interests, winning outcomes and failing outcomes and/or current trends and emerging trends; and (4) learning presbyopia  paying attention ineptly to short-term goals and long-term goals, local interests and global interests, winning outcomes and failing outcomes, current trends and emerging trends. We argue that these attention disorders lead to specific incompetence traps. We apply this typology to reveal the cognitive roots of business failure."
2019,"The Unsafe Act That Just Happened: Bounded Rationality Meets Bounded Reliability Organizations frequently fail  sometimes leading to a catastrophe with numerous casualties, but much more often leading to undesired organizational outcomes such as financial or reputational damages. The literature points to unsafe acts, in the form of errors or violations, lying at the root of organizational failure. However, what processes lead actors to commit such unsafe acts and how exactly this leads to failure remains elusive. We report on an in-depth longitudinal case study of a failed attempt by a European telecom company  by the name of ETEL  to develop and market a new Internet service. The company aimed to roll out a state of the art fiberglass network and to ramp-up novel services made possible by the new network. The case describes how new customers were acquired much more quickly than the operational organization of ETEL could handle and how this process went on for too long, leading to a disastrous outcome. We argue that the interplay between two basic assumptions of human behavior  bounded rationality and bounded reliability  determined how events unfolded over time, by influencing ETELs attitude towards risk. Moreover, we show how the interactive effects of bounded rationality and bounded reliability result from a long-term dynamic process that involved the collective organization of ETEL, rather than from mere static characteristics of key organizational members. Our research calls for new ways of studying the antecedents of organizational risk attitudes and behaviors that may lead to organizational failures."
2019,"Learning from Failed Innovation Experiments A large body of quantitative empirical research has shown that organizations can and do learn from failure in contexts characterized by low causal ambiguity and low failure rates. However, it remains unclear under what conditions organizations or more or less likely to learn from failure when performing innovative experiments in contexts characterized by high causal ambiguity and high failure rates. This paper develops a theoretical framework to explain and predict when experimental failures are likely to helpand even potentially harman organizations future chances for innovative success. This framework is tested using a unique dataset obtained from the Google Play app store. The paper finds that, on average, the more failed experiments an organization has performed in the past, the lower its current odds of success. However, the paper also finds that organizations are more likely to learn from failed innovation experiments when their past experiments were low (rather than high) in novelty and when their pace of experimentation was quick (rather than slow)."
2019,"Meta Organizations and the Emergence of Corporate Professionalism: The Case of UK Consultancy This paper advances our understanding of how organizations which employ or host professionals, such as professional service firms, may influence the strategies of professions as collective actors. Specifically we focus on the characteristics of professional associations and the extent to which they involve both individual practitioners and organizations as members or sponsors. Drawing on theories of meta-organization, we note the latter can have profound consequences for the policies and practices of associations, pulling them away from the objectives of occupational closure. To investigate this concern the paper focuses on the illustrative case of the professionalization of management consulting in the UK over a 50-year period. Our analysis of archival and interview data highlights the way in which key associations in this field adopted both the form and behavioral traits of meta-organizations. We show how this process resulted in a departure from occupational closure objectives in two areas: greater inclusiveness of membership and pragmatism with regard to the framing and enforcement of professional standards. In the final section of the paper we discuss how this tendency is also exaggerated by the absence of a supportive climate for professional development and may, over time, trigger an alternative pathway of corporate professionalism."
2019,"Identity Construction of Nascent Occupational Groups under Organizational and Institutional Pressure In this paper, we investigate how members of a nascent occupation articulate their practices and identities as occupational members in a condition of strong institutional expectations from organizational and institutional constituencies. To this end, we analyze archival evidence to unveil how the American astronauts constructed their occupational identity in the early years of the Space Program (1959-1974) and to understand what role institutional and organizational expectations played in this process. We identify three phases (i.e. pioneering, articulating, and consolidating) in the process of identity construction by members of the nascent occupation. In each phase, the occupational identity of the group members emerged as the result of mutual influences across three levels of analysis: the occupational group, the organization they worked for (i.e., NASA), and the institutional environment in which they operated. The process of identity construction developed in this study redirects attention away from the legitimation efforts of members of nascent occupations and towards a more relational process of identity construction, in which occupational group members constantly negotiate and co-construct their occupational identity in relation to the organization and the environment in which they operate."
2019,"Institutional Work and Professional Values: Values Work by Nurses in the Emergency Department Interest in values work - the purposeful effort of actors to create, maintain and disrupt the values of organizations and institutions  is growing among institutional scholars. In the sociology of professions, scholars feel uneasy about the normative values of professions given contemporary organizing trends towards managerialism. Connecting these lines of inquiry, we ask: How do professionals engage in values work while enacting managerialist practices inside organizations? We investigate this question using a case study of nurses enacting practices associated with lean production management in a hospital emergency department in Australia. Our findings show that when individual nurses enact managerialist practices, they undertake values work directed at three professional values: patient safety, humanistic care, and practitioner expertise. Values work occurs by hierarchically categorising the professions values and using strategies within the managerialist practice to (1) defend a superordinate value category; (2) contain erosion of a subordinate value category; and (3) integrate a complementary value category. Our study advances the literature by opening up the multi-dimensional nature of values work and the role of categorisation. We also offer insight into how the values of professions can be maintained in individual professionals everyday lived experiences of managerialist practices inside organizations."
2019,"Professional Modularity This article introduces the concept of professional modularity, the degree to which a profession and its associated professionals can be produced independently of organizations and later integrated with ease into the existing structures and practices of a generalized, ideal-type organization. Professional modularity emerged as a product of the symbiotic relationship between professions and organizations, in which professions provide the human capital necessary for organizations to succeed and organizations provide employment and legitimacy to professions. In this conceptual paper, we explore the emergence and nature of professional modularity and then offer organizational, professional, and industry level conditions under which modularity is either likely to exist or be most beneficial to organizations. We draw on both the sociology of professions and institutional theory to drive our theorizing, and the concept of professional modularity contributes to both in turn."
2019,"Marriage of Unequals? Investment Quality Heterogeneity and the Formation of Status-Asymmetric Ties In this study, we investigate the emergence of status-asymmetric ties among venture capital firms. We propose that upward status asymmetries (in which a lower-status actor brings a higher-status alter into a project) occur under markedly different conditions than do downward status asymmetries (in which a higher-status actor brings in a lower-status alter). Lower-status firms tend to bring in higher-status alters into well-performing projects, because the high-status partner would not participate in less stellar opportunities and because the lower-status partner would be willing to share the spoils in exchange for status spillovers from the high-status partner. Conversely, higher-status partners tend to engage lower-status alters in poorly performing projects, because the low-status partner would be more willing to accept a potentially worse investment in exchange for the benefits of a higher-status affiliation. We test these theories in the context of venture capital syndication. We find consistent support for our predictions and document that low-status actors gestures to build relationships with high-status alters by bringing them into promising opportunities are rarely reciprocated. We discuss the implications of our study for the broader literatures on network dynamics and organizational inequality."
2019,"Counteracting Status Homophily (Heterophily): Microlevel Mechanisms in an Online Peer-to-Peer Market The tendency to transact with similar or higher status actors is well documented. While previous work emphasized resource and coordination needs that counteract this tendency, this article looks at how actors may counteract it due to their performance rating considerations. Anxieties over performance rating may drive actors rating shopping behaviors and their strategies of exchange partner selection. I test this rating shopping mechanism in the context of a peer-to-peer marketplace where ratings are cornerstones of these marketplaces. The analysis of a proprietary dataset of a home swap platform shows that among higher-status prospective counterplayers, the focal actor will choose status-homophilous ones as exchange partners (status homophily) for the fear that they themselves will be devaluated by even-higher-status counterplayers; in contrast, among lower-status prospective counterplayers, the focal actor will choose status-heterophilous ones as exchange partners (status heterophily) for the speculation that even-lower-status actors can be easily impressed and thus provide desired positive ratings. Furthermore, when the focal actor experiences a decrease in ratings, to garner desired ratings, the tendency to exchange with lower-status counterplayers is even stronger. This study contributes to theories of status homophily (heterophily) and advances the literature on rating and commensuration."
2019,"Navigating Status-Authority Asymmetry between Professions: The Case of 911 Emergency Management Status-authority asymmetry between professions emerge when a profession characterized by lower status is mandated by the organization to command and get work done from another profession with higher status and lower formal authority. This, in turn, can undermine cross-professional coordination. How do lower-status professionals with higher formal authority navigate status-authority asymmetry to orchestrate cross-professional coordination with higher-status professionals? To answer this question, I conducted a 24-month ethnography of 911 emergency management, and examined coordination encounters between 911 dispatchers and police officers. I identify a set of practices entailing communication media (open or private radio channels) and relational tactics (personalizing to officers, escalating to supervisors, and publicizing to peers) that 911 dispatchers use during the emergency coordination process. Specifically, I find that as compared to personalizing and escalating, publicizing an individual police officers non-compliant behavior to his immediate peer group (i.e., the police unit) via the open radio channel enabled the dispatchers to navigate status-authority asymmetry and orchestrate effective cross-professional coordination. Insofar as the lower-status professionals with higher formal authority (i.e., dispatchers) are able to manage the common information space (in this case, the open radio channel) to create and disseminate peer knowledge about the non-compliant behavior of higher-status professionals (i.e., the police officers), then that will in turn trigger peer control and self-disciplining, as the non-compliant individuals professional status is on the line in front of the immediate peer group. I discuss the implications of these findings for research on cross-professional coordination and status-authority asymmetry."
2019,"Crossing Double-edged Swords: Categorical Distance, Status Distance, and Tie Formation Whereas conventional wisdom suggests that categorical and status distances can reinforce each others negative effect on interpersonal tie formation, it largely overlooked the possibility that, because of their double-edged nature, categorical and status distances may weaken each others negative impact. We argue that, in contexts where innovation and identity distinction are both important, status distance can help overcome categorical barriers to interpersonal tie formation. In support for our theory, analysis of music collaboration in the commercial music industry (2000-2015) shows that categorical (genre) distance reduced the likelihood of collaboration between the main artist and the featured artist of an album, but this negative effect was weaker if the main artist had greater status surplus over the featured artist. In addition, the positive interaction of categorical and status distances was stronger if the main artists status was less volatile, which underlines the importance of the robustness of status-based identity."
2019,"Managing Risk as a Duality of Harm and Benefit Contrasting with existing risk studies that predominantly focus on accidents and disasters, this study examines how organizations, within their normal operations, construct and manage risk as a duality of both harm and benefit. We show organizational risk-management unfolding as a juggling act between reducing harm and increasing benefit. Illustrating the organizational practices through which organizations actively construct and navigate this duality of risk, we show that not all organizations seek balance. Rather, organizations engage in processes of localizing and abstracting that enable them to prioritize either harm or benefit. This contributes to understanding regarding sensemaking about risk by illustrating that it involves constructing the relationship between harm and benefit in different ways. This also shows that multiple entangled practices are important in determining risk management approaches; a counterpoint to many existing studies which have focused primarily on calculative practices. Further, showing that organizations can consistently prioritize one contradictory element of the duality, this study contributes to the wider discussions about organizational approaches in navigating dualities."
2019,"The Emergence of Collective Reflection as a Dynamic Practice Collective reflection has been a long-term issue for scholars and practitioners. Yet, being conceptualized as a shared, discursive practice that is dynamic and supported by structures in organizing, existing studies fall short on explaining and illustrating empirically how collective reflection emerges as such a practice in organizations over time. We apply a Heideggerian-inspired practice perspective to address this gap. Drawing on a longitudinal study of a lean implementation in a Swiss regional hospital, we illustrate the development of various communicative platforms and coordinating mechanisms and explain how these together and over time result in an increase in organizational awareness. The research generates two core insights: First, we empirically identify that collective reflection results from coping with different types of surprises: communicative platforms are established or further developed over time as a reaction to surprise. Second, we show how coordinating mechanisms allow collective reflection to travel through time and space in organizing. These insights complement and extend existing theory on collective reflection in organizations in three important aspects: we explain and illustrate the emergence of collective reflection as a practice, we propose and illustrate collective reflection as active communicative structuring and as a knotted net of activities. We conclude by discussing boundary conditions, future research and practical implications."
2019,"No Place to Go? Unfolding the Reflexivity Paradox in Practice Theory Motivated to resolve what is at best a restriction and is in effect a theoretical impasse on whether and where there is space for reflexivity in the literature on practice theory, we draw on Schatzki to show how reflexivity is possible in everyday practice. This impasse comes about as a result of two prominent perspectives on practice theory within contemporary management and organization studies. The first of these, post Heidegger, is that reflexivity is a mindful, cognitive endeavour that occurs after rather than during practice. The second, post Schn, is that fully embodied reflexivity is what occurs within practice, in contrast to lesser, cognitive reflection after practice. We argue that, in combination, these two perspectives result in what we term the reflexivity paradox: that practitioner reflexivity is possible neither during practice (Position 1) nor after practice (Position 2). In contrast, empirical research into practice has identified the possibility of reflexivity over time. Drawing on this research and on related perspectives on temporality, we transcend the reflexivity paradox by introducing temporal reflexivity as an unfolding, general understanding of practice that occurs not only at particular points or periods in time but in relation to time. We show how this understanding may inform both practice theory and research. We also show how studies of temporal reflexivity in practice may be informed by research into organizational and institutional change, particularly retrospective and historiographical research in which the interplay of past, present and future is figural."
2019,"Becoming Upbeat: Learning the Affecto-Rhythmic Order of Organizational Practices How is it that some organizational practices flow like clockwork and may even energize us whereas others seem to be stuck in the mud and diminish our capacities to act? In order to understand this, we set out to investigate how rhythms and affects relate in the flow of organizational practicing. We draw upon a practice-based perspective and offer a theoretically and empirically grounded concept, affecto-rhythmic order. This concept captures the entanglement of practice-specific rhythms and affective attunement and highlights their reciprocal nature through which changes in rhythm and the affective attunement of practicing are interrelated. With an ethnographic study of a Nordic startup accelerator, we demonstrate how accelerator participants learn and embody a contextual affecto-rhythmic order and illustrate how this order enhances their individual and collective capacities to engage with the fast-paced development of business ideas and sales pitching skills relevant in the accelerator setting. By so doing, we further elucidate the regulative yet fragile nature of the affecto-rhythmic order. The study contributes new theoretical insights into the entanglement of rhythms and affects in learning and knowing in organizations."
2019,"Practice Change in Communities of Practice Although multiple streams in the literature point at change in practice, we lack an examination of how the process of practice change unfolds. Findings from an 18-month field study into interdisciplinary cancer research at two top-ranked US universities reveal how, on a micro level, scientists blurred practices in two diverse domains. Practice blurring implies that features of one domain-specific practice come to characterize practice in another domain and vice versa. The case of cancer research based on experimental biology and computational modeling exhibits how scientists  through the three microprocesses absorbing, directing, and rescaling  shaped their practices to make them compatible. Interestingly, scientists succeeded only if all three microprocesses were present. The article elaborates a framework of practice evolution that serves to review the findings from a broader angle. The framework brings together practice-based work with institutional theory and, in light of this studys findings, has implications for research in these traditions."
2019,"A Rising Tide Lifts All Boats: The Origins of Institutionalized Aesthetic Innovation This paper highlights that the strategic use of design, a competitive pattern typically associated with creative industries, those creating and trading meanings, also characterizes industries that produce functional or utilitarian goods not typically considered creative. The paper explores the origins of this phenomenon in the context of three industry settings: cars, specialty coffee, and personal computers. The analysis theorizes three distinct strategic paths that explain how design may become an institutionalized aspect of competition in industries that are not creative. We explain how firms link their products to the identities of their users, how design is linked to stakeholders emotions and visceral reactions to products, and how intermediaries are relevant to enhancing attention to design. Illuminating these strategic paths allows harnessing some of the well-established understandings about competition in creative industries toward understanding competition in non-creative industries."
2019,"The Joke's on Us: The Effect of Organizational Memes on Social Approval of Organizations Constituents evaluations of organizations influence organizational outcomes. Research has primarily examined how traditional media content affects constituents evaluations, yet has rarely investigated the effect of social media content on constituents evaluations of organizations even though social media play a prominent role in many constituents lives. Although much of social media content appears to be frivolous entertainment, we theorize these unique forms of social media content influence social approval of organizations, and thus, should be better understood by researchers and strategic leaders alike. We develop and test a framework of figurative social media content using the example of visual metaphorical communicationsorganizational memesgiven that organizational memes provide an extreme example of ubiquitous social media content that is rare in traditional media. While it might be easy to dismiss organizational memes as unimportant jokes that are unlikely to affect social approval, based on rhetorical and metaphorical communications theories we predict this type of content impacts organizational social approval. We also predict that perceptions of the degree of humor, hyperbole, and accuracy in organizational memes further influences these judgments. We test our theoretical framework in a controlled laboratory setting, and contribute to social approval and communications theories."
2019,"From Catch-and-Harvest to Catch-and-Release: Multimodality and Deinstitutionalization In this paper, we join research on deinstitutionalization with the multimodal turn in organization studies to explore how organizations can use visual and material artifacts to assault longstanding practices. We adopt an interpretive approach using magazine cover images to explore the deinstitutionalization of catch-and-harvest fly fishing practices in the United States, spotlighting organizational strategies around multimodality, including material scrubbing and distancing the gaze. We also detail how organizations can repackage material artifacts linked to practices that have fallen out of fashion as a distinct type of historical capital. This article expands prior research on deinstitutionalization, which has long emphasized the use of discourse, to also include how organizations might deploy visuality and materiality relative to cases of deinstitutionalization."
2019,"Constituting Institutions in Visual Communication: A Barthesian Perspective We extend communicative institutionalism and the communicative constitution of organization by investigating how visual communication contributes to the social construction of institutional reality. We develop a Barthesian approach to visual analysis that is sensitive to power and recognizes multivocality by privileging the viewers/receivers over the operators/transmitters. We apply this approach to the analysis of the photographs of the UK White Paper Industrial Strategy, a document that links in communication the macro-level of policy-making to the micro-level of individual actors. Our analysis relies on Barthes distinction between two interpretive processes: the studium of the viewer as docile cultural subject; and, the punctum of the viewer as self-reflexive critical agent. In the case of the White Paper, the studium constitutes innovation through the interplay of three communicative themes  namely, de-humanization, science as panacea, and Great Britain founding myths  and generates an official, legitimate version of what constitutes innovation that operates as an institutional-level logic, co-orients understandings, and ultimately informs practice. As a critical process, the punctum challenges this un-reflexive interpretation of innovation, potentially stimulating change. Overall, we contribute to theory by demonstrating the formative effect of visual communication as an ongoing, contested flow of practice where power dynamics and multivocality generate institutional ontogenetic opportunities. Moreover, we identify studium and punctum as the communication interpretive processes that regulate and contribute to, respectively, institutional maintenance/reproduction and change. We also link institutional dynamics across levels and highlight the potential role played by social actors like regulators and policy makers."
2019,"Digital Technology Investments in the Face of Non-Knowledge Despite research interest in digital technology investments, insights into the boundary conditions of the benefits of digital technology investments remain vague. By relating to the metacognition literature and literature on non-knowledge our study elaborates the role of managerial digitalization knowledge and metacognition for achieving merits of digital technology investments. We argue that digitalization investments do not automatically result in efficiency and innovation advantages. The present study introduces managerial digitalization metacognition as a means to manage non-knowledge. To test our hypothesis, we draw on a sample of 212 firms operating in the global manufacturing sector. The empirical results indicate that managerial digitalization metacognition moderates the relationship between digital technology investments and a firms digital technology benefits positively. Contrary to our expectation, managerial digitalization knowledge has a negative moderation effect."
2019,"The Marginal Utility Effect of Formalization for Digital Product Innovation The success of digital product innovations depends on how firms can cope with the inherent ambiguity of digital technologies. From a sensemaking perspective, formalization can help to cope with ambiguity. Following this theoretic string, our model assumes a diminishing marginal utility effect through formalization on digitalization on the radicalness and performance of digital product innovations. Our model further hypothesizes a moderating effect by firm age, because mature firms differ from young firms in their innovation processes, in processing ambiguities, and their need for guidance through sensemaking. To test our hypotheses, we draw on a sample of 395 firms operating in the global manufacturing industry. The empirical results support the assumed diminishing marginal utility effects and reveal that mature firms achieve greater merits from digitalization formalization compared to young firms."
2019,"The Construction of Social Performance in Digital Communication Channels Firms increasingly need to perform well socially and therefore often adjust their strategies based on social performance feedback. However, social performance feedback tends to be multivocal and non-linear particularly in digital communication channels to which firm-stakeholder communication increasingly moves. This makes it hard for firms to understand when their social performance is acceptable and when they need to make a change. We present a longitudinal case study to unpack the dynamics of social performance construction in digital communication channels. We identify recurring loops of social performance construction. Our findings suggest that in particular mixed feedback influentially shapes perceived social performance levels, while clearly positive or negative feedback has little effect. We further show how stakeholders self-police discussion channels, which reduces heterogeneity of feedback, supporting the firms ability to comprehend social performance feedback. Based on these insights, we present a model on how social performance is iteratively constructed between firm and stakeholders."
2019,"The Perception of Rationality in a Digitized World The perception of rationality is central to mutual understanding, trust and collaboration. It is commonly assessed against performance in problem solving. Criteria focus on the sampling which supports problem representation, plus the methods and logics used in solution search and selection. And mindful that agents possess limited reasoning capabilities, criteria often allow for trade-offs and simplifications. Notably, however, digitization permits agents to transcend traditional limits in problem solving. Employing digital tools and techniques, problem solving incorporates more expansive sampling, solution search and also calculation. New challenges then arise, because digitally augmented problem solving may lead to overly farsighted processes, defined as hyperopic problem sampling and solution search; farsighted hyperopia being the inverse of nearsighted myopia. Moreover, when hyperopia in one component of problem solving occurs with myopia in another, performances can appear less rational. This is because digitally augmented problem solving is prone to excessive simplification or complication of problems and solutions, heightening discrepancy between reference systems. Digitization thereby amplifies the risk of perceived irrationality in problem solving. My paper examines the mechanisms which create this risk, and the consequences for social and behavioral theories."
2019,"Categorization and Boundary Objects at a Science-Based Start-up How do start-up entrepreneurs negotiate between competing demands of groups aligned with different categorical understandings in the context of the development and commercialization of breakthrough science? Categories represent legitimate bases for resource acquisition. They create abstract claims to rare knowledge and techniques and, at the same time, are aligned with specific organizational forms. Thus, science and technology are two such categories that are often seen to be in harmony. But the claims of science-based activity and technology-based commercialization can be discrepant. In our investigation of a startup that combined at its inception both a science focus and a technology focus, we found that the intersectionality of categorical claims was facilitated by the emergence of a boundary object  the endohedral fullerene. The boundary object allowed the same events to be evaluated through the lens of either science or technology. But as the boundary object moved from its status as a yet-to-be-realized entity to become an actual product, then the boundary object transitioned into an anchor for the scientific categorical understanding of the ventures strategic direction. This, in turn, constrained the technology categorical understanding of the strategic future of the organization. The duality that had been held together by the ambivalent sensemaking facilitated by the boundary object was pulled apart into a dualism. The company broke into two parts. The surviving technology organization focused its efforts on commercial products whereas a spinoff science-based venture carried on pure research, anchored by the emergent production of endohedral fullerenes in collaboration with a research university."
2019,"Some Like It Odd: Organizational Atypicality, Audience Expertise and Valuation in Venture Capital Research suggests that atypical organizations are sanctioned by market audiences compared to more typical ones. This paper underlines the boundary conditions of these effects: in context where audiences are looking for innovativeness and where candidates for evaluation have already reached a certain level of quality standard, atypicality should be rewarded. Moreover, building on cognitive research, we suggest that audience members expertise should amplify the positive appraisal of atypicality. We test our hypotheses in the context of venture capital financing using around 99,000 deals from 1994 to 2017 worldwide. Consistently with our hypotheses, we find, first, that more atypical investees (start-ups) are likely to receive higher valuation and, second, that investors expertise amplifies the positive relationship between investees atypicality and investees valuation. Beyond offering a novel measure of organizational atypicality accounting for category nesting (vertical disposition of categories), this paper contributes to the study of the evaluation of atypical identities on markets and more broadly to the research on market categories."
2019,"Who Gets Admitted? The Gatekeeper Effect in Peer Accreditation In accreditation, candidates are evaluated against a standard for being admitted to a closed category, such as a profession or an organizational grouping. Accreditors typically have to simultaneously judge a candidates performance record and fit with the category. While prior work suggests that higher performing candidates may get away with lower fit, we offer an alternative view. Because categories underpin collective identities, peer accreditors expect stronger categorical fit from high performers, compared to low performers, because high performers pose a greater threat to the coherence of the category. Peer evaluators act as gatekeepers for the category by avoiding to admit powerful yet ill-fitting newcomers as they may durable alter the category. The gatekeeper effect becomes more pronounced when categories have fewer members and are crisper, and when peer evaluators are more typical of the category they represent. We use data extracted from 56,000 resumes submitted by individuals for accreditation in Italian academia to test and confirm our hypotheses. Our findings have implications for work on social evaluation, categories, and collective identity."
2019,"The Categorical Conundrum: Legitimacy in Flux and Interpretive Uncertainty during Category Emergence Extant theory has emphasized the disciplining force of the categorical imperative which compels new firms and markets to fit existing categories. Those that do not fit existing categories are theorized to suffer from the liability of newness that thrusts on them an illegitimacy discount jeopardizing survival and success. However, new categories are endlessly being created by entrepreneurs in unceasing gales of creative destruction. In this article I reconcile this fundamental contradiction by offering a new theory of category emergency. In order to do so, I juxtapose the dimensions of audience evaluations of legitimacy (homogeneous and heterogeneous) and category borders (permeable and impermeable) to posit four types of category emergence: divergence, dilution, disruption, and dissolution. I propose that the former two types of category emergence  divergence and dilution  are the domains of much of extant research focused on the illegitimacy discount. The latter two types of category emergence  disruption and dissolution  are comparatively uncharted territory that delineate contexts where legitimacy is in flux and the source of uncertainty. My theory further offers propositions linking types of category emergence with specific forms of uncertainty. In doing so I offer new insights into legitimacy, category emergence, and uncertainty."
2019,"Financing Choices in Learning-intensive Industries: Implications for Firm Survival We investigate the impact of learning-by-doing on the firms financing choices in learning-intensive industries and the implications it has on firm survival. Using data on 98 SIC-3 industries from Compustat along with estimates of industry learning intensities from previous studies, we find that firms operating in industries where learning-by-doing is important are more prone to bankruptcy. We also find that firms in learning-intensive industries are significantly less reliant on debt financing. Our paper adds industry learning environment as an important determinant of financing choices in firms as well as their survival and highlights a new strategic implication of the dynamic, uncertain and tacit process of learning-by-doing."
2019,"The Truth Will Set You Free: Performance Perception Accuracy and Organizational Learning Organizations and individuals learn from experience, which includes both successes and failures. Success drives individuals to reify existing knowledge and routines, while failure drives individuals to search for causes and discover new routines that can correct the flaws that produced failure. While considerable research examines how different types of experience influences learning from success and failure, research has yet to explore how perceptions of the experience impact this learning process. Using project-level data from a global professional services company, we explore how the accuracy of project performance perceptions affects subsequent learning from those projects. We expect that individuals learn from experience but argue that when individuals misperceive prior performance in either direction (they are overly positive or overly negative about the past) they do not learn. We also argue that prior experience, demands on attention, and the amount of individual effort expended in evaluating prior experience each influence the likelihood and the direction of performance perception inaccuracy. We find that misperceptions can wipe out learning benefits of experience and we identify a partial remedy in that increased attention and effort can reduce misperceptions. In general, our research highlights the role and importance of individual perceptions in the learning process."
2019,"Interfirm Adaptation: An Integrative Perspective Promoting interfirm adaptation is an increasingly important coordination function, although there is little evidence of the role of interfirm governance mechanisms in engendering such a managerial focus. To address this issue, we link organizational design theory to organizational learning theory and propose an integrated model for specifying the link: coordination mechanisms and interfirm adaptation. We reason that interfirm adaptation functions better because the parties involved have developed valuable learning processes (e.g., knowledge articulation and internalization), which act as a mediator that facilitate interfirm adaptation. Specifically, this study contributes to the central problem of interfirm adaptation, contributing to the research literature both theoretically and empirically."
2019,"Evaluation Heterogeneity and Loss of Good Ideas in Organizational Learning The literature on innovation and learning has emphasized the importance of diversity of ideas or knowledge. To boost or maintain diversity, an organization can establish subunits for specialization of different activities, while rotating a few individuals across subunits for cross-fertilization of ideas. Thus far, the literature has taken it for granted that organizations will benefit from boosting diversity with such a differentiated organizational structure. We argue that this received view may not always hold true. By developing computational models, we show that cross-fertilization of ideas to boost diversity will hamper organizational learning if subunits have substantially different evaluation criteria. One trivial reason is that evaluation heterogeneity affects group members to ignore ideas coming from the other group simply because what is good in one group is not good in the other. A more complicated reason is that even when new ideas brought to the focal group by transferred individuals are good based on the focal groups evaluation criteria, these ideas tend to be ignored in the group learning process because the substantial difference in evaluation criteria makes the transferred individuals look unappealing learning targets for the other group members. Then, bad ideas in the focal group can kill good ideas brought by transferred individuals."
2019,"Hybrid Organizing in Complex and Turbulent Fields: Libert, Egalit ... Ambition? Although recent literature on hybrids has been flourishing, the question of how hybrids emerge and progressively gain influence over a complex and turbulent field remains under-researched. In this paper, we seek to address this gap. To do so, we engaged in an inductive study of a hybrid organization emerging in an original empirical context: the field of equal opportunities in France. Equal opportunities reflect herein a socio-political will in reducing social inequalities, especially for young people, and in contributing thus to social inclusion. But this malleable concept may be interpreted in several ways, supported by different competing institutional logics (Friedland & Alford, 1991; Thornton et al., 2012). The resulting institutional complexity (Greenwood et al., 2011; Besharov & Smith, 2014) creates both tensions and opportunities for hybrid organizations. Moreover, literature suggests that managing organizational tensions is particularly challenging in situations of environmental turbulence (Reay & Hinings, 2009; Ramus et al., 2017). Our results show that environmental turbulence and emotions (Toubiana & Zietsma, 2017) also open opportunities for strategic hybrid organizations to become visible actors in the field, and influence the competing institutional logics through active interactions and involvement within the field."
2019,"Building Blocks of Social Organization: Audience Perceptions of Hybrid Organizations as Assemblies Organizational theories hold that audiences view pure organizations as legitimate and are thus more likely to support them. But hybrids of prototypical organizationssuch as those combining features of corporations and charitiesare common. Knowing how audiences actually discern organizations is challenging because observational data conflate competing perceptions of legitimacy. I propose an institutional theory of organizations as assemblies of building blocks whose evaluation depends on context and combination. I test this idea using a conjoint experiment to gauge audience reactions to simulated organization in the social sector. Respondents do not penalize impure organizations. Instead, in the social sector, audiences prefer the best of both worlds. The combination of charitable, participatory, and rational practices explains the non-linear effect of nonprofitness on audience support. This effect is due to an interplay of pragmatic and moral legitimacy rather than an affordance of typicality. The paper contributes to a practice-based view of institutional theory, highlights limitations of audience-side explanations of hybridity, and reveals the cultural underpinnings of nonprofit organizations."
2019,"The Theater of Innovation: Developing Transferable Skills to Perform Hybridity Hybrid organizations have been characterized as contradictory, conflictual, and thus inherently problematic for organizational actors. The organizational and sociological literatures offers two complementary strategies for performing for multiple audiences with competing norms and evaluative schemata decoupling and robust action although there are also significant challenges to these strategies, especially when employees view the organizations hybrid form as a threat to their own professional specializations. I present ethnographic data on the Janus Laboratory, simultaneously an academic research and teaching program and applied R&D; incubator sponsored by private companies. I find that by repeatedly participating in the organizations presentation ritual demonstrations of technological innovations individual employees (graduate students) acquire transferable, dramaturgical skills to support the delivery of multiple framings of their work to diverse audiences on behalf of the organization."
2019,"Categories as Impact Drivers: A unique approach to scaling and change Research on organizational approaches to social and environmental issues has focused on market-related aspects such as tensions inherent in hybrid organizing, but as nonprofit organizations become increasingly rational, and attempt to achieve impact  or progress toward social and environmental issues - at scale, there is a need to investigate and develop models that operate under different assumptions to mainstream strategy research. One area involves the dynamics around product categories. Drawing on an in-depth case study of a national nonprofit organization in the United States, we find an interlinked process by which the organization came to enable the music education category of modern band. This process involves 1) an organizational pivot involving the tight coupling of practices and goals, which supports 2) a process of category impact creation involving four generalizable mechanisms  positioning, open-sourcing, receding and moving, which establish the category on the education system level and reorient the organization to focus on promoting the category as an impact driver and change agent. Our study contributes to research on organizational approaches to social issues and makes the case for attention to dynamics around impact models rather than business models. Our process model can be generalized to other social change initiatives that attempt to introduce a new category as a means to scale and as a mode of institutional change and to other organizations that intend to create an unowned category."
2019,"Status and Egocentric Uncertainty: Theoretical Development and Empirical Evidence from Two Settings This study revisits the fundamental proposition that high-status actors will sort away from markets that are high in egocentric uncertainty because egocentric uncertainty undercuts the value of status. We argue instead that high-status actors have access to a large amount of information that helps reduce egocentric uncertainty, and that egocentric and altercentric uncertainties are often coupled. We test our hypotheses in the venture capital market where information is crucial and, contrary to prior findings, our results demonstrate that high-status firms are more likely than their low-status peers to sort into the markets that are high in egocentric uncertainty (i.e., early-stage investments). We find consistent results from the advertising industry where information is less important to reduce egocentric uncertainty. The results also show that high-status advertising firms deploy fewer star professionals in the uncertain market (e.g., digital advertising), lending support to our argument that high-status actors utilize inferior resources as a way to limit the cost of egocentric uncertainty."
2019,"Category Kings and Commoners: Within and Across Cross-Category Spillovers in the Sharing Economy Through an inductive study of the sharing economy field in the UK, we examine spill-overs within the context of sharing economy categories. We investigate the concepts of category kings and commoners in this empirical setting and we find that besides the previously established reputational spillovers, spill-overs in awareness, regulation, and customer usage are also present between category kings and commoners. We expand extant work on categories by discussing the impact of those category spill-overs between category kings and commoners on the growth of a new field."
2019,"CEO and Organizational Celebrity: Investigating Media Attributions and Organizational Agency CEO and organizational celebrity are two important social approval assets that have relevant, yet different, effects on organizational decision making processes and performance (Rindova, Pollock, & Hayward, 2006). Empirical research on these constructs has mostly focused on investigating the consequences of celebrity at different levels, and only few empirical studies have investigated how celebrity emerges at different organizational levels. Building on previous work on CEO (Hayward et al., 2004) and organizational celebrity (Rindova et al., 2006), and integrating attribution (Kelley, 1973), and framing theory (Entman, 1993), I develop predictions on the factors that affect the likelihood of CEO and organizational celebrity to emerge. I test the hypotheses on a sample of 158 Fortune 500 firms. The results show that the more the positive competitive actions undertaken by a company, the more likely is the emergence of organizational celebrity, but not CEO celebrity. However, contrary to current theory, the distinctiveness of those competitive actions does not increase their efficacy in affecting the emergence of celebrity at either level, unless communicated distinctiveness is considered. Nevertheless, the frequency and distinctiveness of competitive actions become important in determining celebrity when individual or organizational attributional frames are made more salient through the frames promoted in press releases. The results have important theoretical, methodological and practical implications."
2019,"Not All Status Are Created Equal: Inter-Subjective Uncertainty and the Use of Status Indicators This paper examines factors that shape expert evaluators uses of multiple status indicators in the evaluation of early-stage technology start-ups. We propose that while individual-specific uncertainty about the quality of start-ups motivates the use of all possible status indicators, inter-subjective uncertainty about potential disagreements among evaluators motivate the use of consensually legitimate status indicators while discouraging the use of controversial status indicators. We tested this theoretical argument using 5555 expert evaluation profiles of 1111 high-tech start-ups in the competition for a Chinese government innovation grant. Our empirical analysis suggests that having top university graduatesa consensually legitimate status indicatorconsistently leads to more favorable evaluations of a team, regardless of the level of within-group disagreement among evaluators, while having team members with oversea work experiencesa controversial status indicatorserves as quality signal only when within-group disagreement is low. High levels of within-group disagreement among evaluators reduce the use of oversea work experience as a quality signal, even if evaluators personally felt certain about the project."
2019,"Harnessing Work Passion for Advantage in Fine Wineries How do firms garner and leverage employee work passion to gain differentiation advantages? We conduct a mixed-method study of how fine wineries in Ontario, Canada harness passion to create differentiated products in a crowded market. Our qualitative analysis reveals that winery leaders publicly expressed their passion for three domains of fine winemaking (i.e., community, craft and innovation) in ways that attracted, harnessed, and inspired like-minded employees. Because a particular domain of work resonated with these employees, they were keen to support and enhance the unique capabilities underlying a leaders chosen differentiation strategy. To buttress these findings, we analyze expressions of passion (i.e., winemaking philosophies, mission statements, and other public communications) of 117 of Ontarios fine winery leaders and examine the effects of passion on the results of a proxy for performance in the industry: wine competitions. The quantitative analysis finds that wineries whose leaders expressed passion for the three domains of winemaking were more likely to perform well in competition; effects were particularly strong for wineries located at the periphery of the industry with limited access to resources. Our results suggest that while leaders have historically sought to spread their passion for work to their employees to achieve organizational goals, whether that passion will serve as a source of differentiation advantage is strongly influenced by whether it resonates with employees and aligns with their differentiation strategies."
2019,"Analytical Tools and the Practices of Validation in the Production of Strategic Analysis New analytical tools used by knowledge workers contain embedded assumptions which influence the results of analysis. Though literature on knowledge work has long noted the central role that technologies play in producing knowledge, existing literature has focused on contexts such as scientific labs in which the output of tools can be validated using theoretical principles and physical referents. These feedback mechanisms, however, are largely absent in the context of strategic analysis, where analytical tools are increasingly relied upon. How, then, are tools used, understood, and validated in the production of strategic analysis, and with what consequences? In order to address this question, I conducted a two-year ethnographic study of the use of analytical tools in producing strategic analysis within an investment bank. I find two distinct paths to validate analysis through what I call validating practices, which are a set of actions that confer the produced analysis as trustworthy. Surprisingly, engaging in these practices does not necessarily mean that calculations performed by technologies are understood. Specifically, these pathways hold different consequences for the consistency of assumptions within produced analysis, the development of expertise, and whether groups are conscious of the assumptions in their tools or routinely take them for granted."
2019,"Making Use of Complexity: Crafting a City Strategy in Institutional Dialogue This paper contributes to our understanding of the use of societal institutions in interaction, as they are adapted to an evolving cultural, social, and economic context. It does so by taking a practice perspective to institutions, studying the ways in which continuously adapted to organisational and situational contexts. The paper draws on a longitudinal case study of strategy work in a Finnish city. My analysis, based on observations, interviews and documents, elucidates the discursive practices through which participants enacted four central institutions in a polyphonic dialogue which enabled coordinated organizational action without resolving institutional complexity. The dialogical approach taken broadens our understanding of the central role of lan-guage in the use and adaptation of societal institutions. Additionally, this paper elucidates the constructive side of persistent institutional complexity, showing how transient situational settlements enable coordinated organisational action while maintaining the flexibility necessary for later action."
2019,"Formulating Open Strategies in a University Setting: A Response to Increased Stakeholder Demands The universitys missions and its role in society have been an important discussion as stakeholder expectations rise and budgetary constraints tighten. In order to respond to these macro conditions, strategic planning has become increasingly integral to university operations with research universities developing each their own university strategy addressing internal matters and external opportunities. This inductive case study explores the process of formulating a strategy at the large science research and education institution. Addressing questions related to openness as an organizing principle, results suggest that inclusion and transparency are widely promoted in the strategy-making process, however the strategy formulation process of the individual departments becomes a practice of combining top-down and bottom-up approaches as a way to maintain openness and participation at the process itself."
2019,"Capturing Affordability in Institutional Maintenance Works. In this paper, we highlight the challenges connected with the study of institutional maintenance processes. We use an extreme historical case study to illustrate the dynamics of institutional maintenance through the analysis of the persistence of a medieval military order in Bologna: the Compagnia. Using archival data dating back to the XII century, we analyze institutional maintenance dynamics, proposing an affordability framework in which we find two new central works that determine the persistence of the institution when its main goals have disappeared: artifact and unburden work. We illustrate the affordability framework connecting the existing literature on maintenance work and showing how the selection and use of strong and weak maintenance works is key to preserve the institution."
2019,"The Role of Status Symbols in Preserving Inter-Professional Boundaries  Since the time of Weber (1922), the literature on professions has identified a range of strategies used by professionals to retain their share of rewards, exclude ineligible individuals and maintain their superior status. This study focuses on the symbolic realm of the struggle to preserve superior status and asks the question: How are status symbols used to demarcate jurisdictional boundaries between professions. I analyzed ethnographic material concerning one of the most elite and ancient professions: Scottish advocatesknown as barristers outside Scotland. I found that when faced with threat from other professions, advocates engaged in differentiation through the use of status symbols such as professional dress in and out of court, ceremonies, everyday rituals, and forms of address. I observed two concurrent processes of differentiation: the maintenance of stability of status symbols and the maintenance of the mobility of status symbols, which can be explained by the so-called Simmel effect (1895). Building on the Simmel effect, I argue that imitation and distinctiveness preserve professional differentiation, and that managing the stability of some symbols and the mobility of others allow elite professionals to maintain the superior status of their profession."
2019,"Deviant by Design: A Theory of Stigmatized Artifacts Stigma is defined as an attribute associated with inferiority or deviance within a social context. Sociological and organizational research has peripherally recognized the role of material artifacts in stigmatization, yet the field lacks an empirically grounded theory of how material artifacts mediate stigmatization of individuals. This paper offers a novel theory of stigmatized artifacts through an inductive study of the hearing aid market. By comparing user responses to hearing aids as their formal and functional properties change, the study highlights how organizations can manipulate product designs to mitigate stigmatization of their user base."
2019,"What's in a Model? Computer Simulations and the Management of Ignorance Research on artifacts in organization studies predominantly focuses on knowledge  what we know  and how it is produced, used and exchanged through artifacts. This study examines the role of artifacts in managing ignorance. Namely, what is not known, and what cannot be shared across collaborating organizations. We do that through a qualitative study of the use of computerized simulation models in terrorism insurance, using interviews supplemented by observational data. Illustrating the sources of ignorance, we develop a conceptual framework to show how terrorism models, by compartmentalizing ignorance, enable strategies of acceptance, work around and ignoring of ignorance. This contributes to the nascent area of organizational research on ignorance by unpacking the evolving interplay between knowledge and ignorance. Our study also contributes to the organizational literature on the role of material artifacts as enablers of (inter)action. Further, showing how decoupling elements of ignorance from action occurs when demands for rationality in calculating and trading risk require access to knowledge that science cannot produce, this study contributes to the literature that explores how insurance remains possible in contexts of extreme uncertainty."
2019,"When It Is Good to Be Bad: Rewarding Deviance in Stigmatized Markets Organizations selling stigmatized products persist despite opposition from hostile audiences. Scholars have explained the viability of these organizations by detailing strategies organizations pursue to decrease public scrutiny and opposition. These explanations foreground how organizations attempt to conceal their stigma from hostile outsiders but rarely describe how these stigma management strategies affect selling products to customers. Yet stigmatized markets persist because consumers purchase stigmatized products, inviting further study into how stigma management strategies affect organizational performance. In this paper, I show how hiding stigma can hurt performance and leaning into stigma can help performance. Using deep learning to analyze product descriptions advertised by retailers in Washington States recreational cannabis market, I find that that organizations that hid their products stigmatized features performed worse across all contexts than organizations that did not. However, organizations that highlighted their products stigmatized features performed better than those that did notbut only in areas where stigma was strongest. These findings suggest that in some contexts stigma is an asset, not a liability."
2019,"How Scandals Contaminate Professions: Stigma by Association, Status, and Informal Social Control We study how professions can become contaminated through stigma by association in the wake of a scandal that affects their members. We argue that scandals, being field-moralizing events, durably change the way in which audiences evaluate the conduct of members of the profession in a number of ways. First, we show that in the wake of a scandal the behavior of all professionals within the field faces greater contestation than it did prior to the scandal. Second, we find evidence that following a scandal, high-status professionals face higher levels of contestation than low-status ones. We suggest that this is because the generalized loss of trust in the profession that ensues from a scandal is especially damaging to such actors, in a reversal of the deferenceand associated privilegesthey are usually afforded, generally known as Matthew effect. Third, we show that, because in the wake of a scandal audiences tend to develop a preference for informal social control, perceived inaction on the professionals part will become especially contested, and especially so in the case of high-status professionals. A study of media coverage of Italian football referees decisions before and after the 2006 scandal known as Calciopoli provides support for our arguments."
2019,"All the Right Junk in All the Wrong Places: The Incidence of Stigma in the Food Retail Market Prior research has shown that stigma negatively affects organizations. However, stigma does not occur in a vacuum, but rather within socio-cognitive structures in which organizations are embedded. We advance that, once contextualizing stigma in a market structure segmented into categories, not only the attributes of each individual category, but also the pattern of inter category relationships contributes to the incidence of categorical stigma. Specifically, we advance that the social evaluations leading to stigma result from both absolute and relative perceptions of negative attributes. We test our predictions by analyzing the incidence of the junk food stigma on the categories mapping the US food retail market between 2006 and 2015. Results support our theory and highlight the structural antecedents of stigma above and beyond the absolute appreciation of categorical attributes."
2019,"Beyond Best Intentions: Stigma-resilient Leadership and the Emergence of Value for the Marginalised While existing theory on the creation of social value has conceptualized how cognitive, social, and economic barriers inhibit the efforts of organizations to serve the marginalized, we theorize how firms can specifically create value for marginalized populations. Drawing from Goffmans arguments that societies are defined by social stigmas, we argue that the threat of stigmatization and sanctioning during interactions between the marginalized and organizations often prevents organizational actors from overcoming knowledge taboos necessary to create value for disadvantaged groups. We propose a process model of organizational value creation for the marginalized, theorizing that whether organizations are able to bypass knowledge taboos depends upon whether they have stigma-resilient leaders with lived experiences of marginalization, enabling sanctioning navigation competences to produce and deliver value. Specifically, we show how such leaders are more likely to effectively interact with marginalized actors by establishing organizational credibility, network access, and information to garner taboo knowledge of what constitutes value for the marginalized. While prior theory has focused upon how normal leaders and organizations enable the marginalized to overcome their stigmas, we assert that whether a firm can create meaningful value for them depends upon whether non-normals can enable firms to pass as normal among the marginalized."
2019,"Network Neighborhood & Partnerships: From Handshakes to Formal Contracts among US Fire Departments An extensive body of research investigates the conditions giving rise to informal agreements and formal contracts between two partnering organizations. A largely separate body of work has addressed the emergence of ties within organizational networks. In this paper, we contribute to the integration of insights from network theory and contract theory. Specifically, we explore how the level of formality in an agreement between two parties depends on the broader network of exchange relationships in which they are embedded. The analysis draws on the network literature to develop a theory of governance choice that emphasizes the network neighborhood. We argue that partners outside ties influence the coordination, control, and information exchange within the partnership. We test the validity of our claims by analyzing collaborative agreements among U.S. Fire Departments between 1999 and 2010. The results indicate that the network neighborhood significantly influences the way that partners work together."
2019,"A Structural Model of Firm Collaborations with Unobserved Heterogeneity We develop and estimate a structural model of strategic network formation to study the determinants of firms collaborations for patenting new technology in the medical device industry. Our aim is to bridge the strategy literature on interorganizational networks and the economic literature on structural estimation of network models. In our model, firms have payoffs that depend on linking costs and benefits, as well as externalities from common partners and popular partners. Firms are characterized by observed and unobserved characteristics, that affect both their opportunity and their willingness to form links. The equilibrium networks are sparse and match the aggregate clustering levels observed in the data. We use the network of patent collaborations among medical device firms, to estimate the structural parameters using a Bayesian approach. Our results show that firms tend to partner domestically and collaborate with companies in similar markets, perhaps due to technological complementarities or regulation effects. Unobserved heterogeneity matters: we find that firms' payoffs vary by type. Finally we show that the estimated model including unobserved heterogeneity provides a better fit of crucial features of the data."
2019,"Close to Me: Studying the Interplay between Physical and Social Space on Dyadic Collaboration Previous studies of intra-organizational and inter-personal collaboration networks have emphasized the crucial role that social network structures play in various dimensions of organizational performance. Yet, all these network studies overlook the role that physical spaces, and in particular inter-personal physical distance, may play in determining the effect of network structure on collaborative performance. We close this salient gap in the literature by taking advantage of a quasi-natural experiment, in which a global pharmaceutical firm relocated two of their regional offices to two new sites. By capturing both the social network and inter-personal distances prior and after the moves, we study the interplay of social network structures and physical spaces on inter-personal collaborative performance. In addition to the expected positive effects of social and physical proximity on collaborative effectiveness, we find that inter-personal distance amplifies the positive effect that social cohesion has on collaborative effectiveness and that affective closeness mediates the effect of physical proximity."
2019,"Formal Governance by Meta-Organizations and the Challenge of Relational Network Alternatives Drawing on interviews and observations of a wholesale fish market in France, this article examines how market actors arbitrate between formal and relational governance of transactions, and how the marketplace, conceptualized as a meta-organization, copes with the challenge of being bypassed. Meta-organizations - organizations that coordinate collective action through agreement among their members about higher-order goals and not through employment contracts  tend to impose organizational rules and regulatory procedures onto their members. Our findings reveal that members of meta-organizations may experience these formal elements as too constraining and opt for relational network alternatives, although less efficient. Findings also reveal that meta-organizations respond to this issue by developing capabilities to simultaneously emulate, and differentiate from, relational network alternatives. The findings extend our understanding of the dynamics between formal and informal governance, and the capabilities meta-organizations develop to make their formal form of governance attractive."
2019,"Institutional Customization: Geography, Meanings, and Investing Practices in the Slow Money Field This paper explores the interplay of the institutional environment and local interactions in shaping heterogeneity of practices in emerging fields. Analysis of micro-level interactions within the Slow Money field, which supports the development of sustainable local food systems by connecting food entrepreneurs with local investors, offers insights into the notion of institutional customization. I introduce the concepts of infrastructural endowment and community support as key geographic dimensions underlying institutional customization, the process by which actors tether local institutions to the meanings and practices of an emerging field. Consistent with the inhabited institutions perspective, I show that each chapter of the non-profit Slow Money developed different interpretations of the general principles, depending on the perceived local strength of infrastructural endowment vis--vis community support. These different interpretations led to variation in investing practices employed by entrepreneurs and investors. By showing how actors gave meaning to homegrown impact investing practices as a result of institutional customization, this work contributes to the literature on geographic heterogeneity in field practices, as well as to the literature on inhabited institutions."
2019,"Competition under Institutional Complexity: The Emergence of Competitive Microcosm This study investigates how and under which conditions hybrids can influence the market dynamics of the fields in which they operate. The methodology follows a qualitative study design in the context of the So Miguel dairy market, where hybrids and commercial oriented organizations have been competing for more than 60 years. The results reveal that hybrids due to the logic they instantiate tend to display a competitive behaviour that deviates from commercial oriented organizations one, thus displaying an atypical behaviour. When such atypical behaviour is associated with relevant market shares, hybrids may increase local market competition. Markets where hybrids and non-hybrid compete may present higher competition levels when compared to markets with similar structure and characteristics, but where all players integrate institutional logics similarly. I refer to this effect as a competitive microcosm."
2019,"Hybridization in Public Discourse: the case of the Practices of Servitization How can hybridization occur at a structural level? Hybrid practices arise from institutional complexity and are recognised for their potential to cope with complex social problems. The literature has concentrated on how practices hybridize at an intra-organisational level, but it has remained silent on how hybridization processes operate at wider  structural  levels. One way to track these processes is to examine how they are materialized in discourses. Thus, this article investigates how discourses capture institutional complexity and shape the emergence of a hybrid practice. Empirically, it studies the emergence of servitization: an innovation whereby manufacturers sell the use of their products instead of products themselves. Through textual statistics based on a media content representing the discourse on servitization in France, I inductively explore the discursive aspects of hybridization. Results capture how institutional logics contribute to and feed the theorization of servitization. They show that the emergence of servitization is supported by the hybridization of the Market and the State logics, both of them being connected through the Climate change one. On this basis, the discursive determinants of hybridization are exposed, and a discursive model of hybridizing is discussed."
2019,"From Compartmentalizers to Hybridizers: How Individuals Respond to Multiple Institutional Logics Research on individual-level responses to multiple institutional logics shows that individuals may either compartmentalize their compliance with logics across time and/or space or combine elements associated with both logics. In this paper, we aim to understand a neglected aspect of this stream: how and why individuals may resort to these responses and how they may evolve over time. Relying on a qualitative inductive research design, we conducted a comparative, longitudinal case study of the life stories of 14 high net worth individuals. We explored the reasons that led some to practice impact investing, a hybrid practice combining features of the logics of philanthropy and finance, while others compartmentalized these logics, keeping their giving and investing activities distinct. We develop a 3-stage process model revealing that individuals relative adherence to field and societal logics at play influences their ability to recognize hybrid practices, to find them appropriate, and to adopt them, thus becoming hybridizers."
2019,"Strategic Renewal: Very Hard, Nearly Impossible Strategic renewal is one of the essential topics in strategic management research. Earlier research has identified individual firm cases of successful renewal yet industry-level evidence on large-scale renewal is largely missing. On the contrary, industry evolution studies offer indirect evidence on the difficulties of strategic renewal. We approach this classic tension by studying industry-level changes in success formulas. We investigate to what extent individual firms are able to switch from one successful configuration to another. Our findings reveal the challenging nature of strategic renewal while further analysis of individual firms sheds light on how successful renewals were practically implemented."
2019,"Organizational Network Resilience after Unexpected Shocks Organizational resilience can be viewed as the capability of organizations and systems to absorb and adapt to environmental shocks, by either bouncing back to their initial status, or achieving a new, more advantageous equilibrium. Limited research has been conducted on the antecedents to organizational and systemic resilience, and particularly in the context of radical, sudden changes. Particularly understudied is the analysis of relational dynamics in situations of sudden change, when social relationships, their structure and their evolution during environmental shocks or turbulences may be an important antecedent of organizational and systemic resilience. This paper explores how organizations within an open, complex adaptive system modify their social capital to achieve performance resilience, by investigating the modifications of patient referral networks among hospitals in the Abruzzo region as a consequence of the 2009 LAquila earthquake. Our findings reveal that the earthquake has an important, although highly-differentiated, effect on the network structure as a whole and on the ego-network structure of regional hospitals. While network structure indicators seem not to be significantly modified by the earthquake and exhibit a substantial stability of the systems performance, social capital structure of the collapsed hospital changes profoundly in the disaster aftermath and these changes are more radical and profound than the those observed in other hospitals in the network. Moreover, our findings highlight that both geographical and social proximity are significant factors underpinning nodes heterogenous reaction to changes. A discussion of the main theoretical contributions of our findings concludes the paper."
2019,"Reframing Capability Reconfigurations: The Failure of Technology Incumbents Revisited There is continuing interest in how established firms can reconfigure their capabilities in response to technological change. While theory on this phenomenon predicts why some technical structural reconfigurations fit better than others, empirical research remains inconsistent on how and which social structures matter more than others. Our theory explains how important social structures (identity, power, and roles) exert influence when an established firm is responding to technological change by reconfiguring its technical structures in the capability base. Building on extant capability reconfiguration theory, we propose a typology that denotes dynamic disequilibrium and the social and technical antecedents and outcomes that follow. Our typology complements the explanatory power of extant capability reconfiguration theory in ways that explain the failure of a technology incumbent by analyzing its internal social structures as to its reciprocity to technical structures in capability configurations. As such, given technological change, we reveal opportunities for incumbents to capitalize on inherent social configurations and highlight threats to incumbents that ignore social configurations. Our work purports that social configurations can be sources of success and failure for an established firm."
2019,"Knowledge Transfer Strategy Under Complexity - Developing Emergency Management Capability Research within emergency management has developed as a stream to create understanding related to performance, efficiency and decrease of uncertainty. The literature gives indication that emergency management capability may be dependent on underlying organizational complexity as well as knowledge transfer. Knowledge transfer is both associated with sense making and for being a part of the articulation processes of individuals in organizations. Knowledge transfer may also influence the emergency management capability of involved organizations and counteract some of the negative effects due to complexity. Yet, what are strategies that can be used for knowledge transfer. This qualitative case study of knowledge transfer in Arctic emergency management under organizational complexity analyses what characterizes knowledge transfer strategy, in order to increase emergency management capability. In depth insights from participation, interviews, as well as observation at a rescue- and survival exercise in the Arctic form the basis of this study. The research illuminates knowledge transfer strategies and finds that creating joint understanding of knowledge  a process related to senesemaking  is both a driver and a part of knowledge transfer, as well as a strategy for knowledge transfer. A conceptual model of knowledge transfer under organizational complexity is developed."
2019,"Were Not like Those Crazy Hippies: Navigating Dual Mandates in Occupational Construction This paper identifies and analyzes the process of how a nascent occupational group forms in large part due to social movement pressure, and importantly how the resultant occupational group members manage competing mandates from the social movement and their hiring organizations to 1) construct an occupational jurisdiction as well as 2) navigate contentious task areas that go against their organizational mandate. Occupations that are created in large part due to social movement pressure, such as diversity managers and corporate social responsibility managers, have been assumed to pursue prototypical professionalization processes that include carving out an occupational jurisdiction that breaks with their social movement roots as well as avoiding contentious task areas. However, by utilizing observations, archival data, and interviews with sustainability managers in higher education, this paper opens up the black box of how individuals hired into these new roles attempt to manage the dual mandate they face in constructing their nascent occupational group. The analyses reveal that this occupational group adopts a formal jurisdiction that conforms more to their organizational mandate, but they retain a continued ongoing relationship with the social movement behind-the-scenes to pursue contentious task areas that align more with their social movement mandate. These findings challenge our existing understanding of how issues that are initially pushed by social movements, such as diversity, gender equality, and environmental sustainability, become managed in organizations through the formation of new occupational groups, as well as our understanding of how new occupational groups navigate dual mandates."
2019,"A Myth Materialized: Occupational Projects and the Recoupling of Reform in a Finnish High School When external institutional structures in the form of laws, regulations, and policies do not serve the practical needs of organizations, they can respond by decoupling formal structure from organizational practice. Furthermore, occupational communities often resist external pressures to change. How can reform happen in a loosely coupled professional setting where there is little managerial influence over the content of work? My ethnographic study of a Finnish school finds that instead of decoupling practice from educational reform, teachers worked to overcome challenges related to digitalizing classroom practice. In contrast to prior research on recoupled practices, this happened in the absence of external efficiency criteria or strong managerial control. I find actors engagement in occupational projects supported by appropriate spaces and roles in professional networks led to recoupling occupational practice to institutional structures defined by educational reform. These findings have implications for understanding decoupling in organizations and the role of occupational identity in micro-level institutional change."
2019,"The Don Quixote Effect: The Role of Imprinting in Regulatory Failures in a Central Bank The article examines the role of belief-environment misfits in regulatory failures, resulting from the disjunctions in the temporalities of beliefs and institutional conditions. In the 1980s, the Bank of Finlands monetary and exchange rate policies transitioned from an administrative logic to a market logic. Amid the transformation of logics, the central bank deregulated interest rates and capital movements, which together with the changed logic in policies eventually led into a credit expansion, an asset price bubble, and a severe banking crisis. Employing transcribed minutes of the Parliamentary Supervision Committee (PSC) of the Bank of Finland, 88 oral history interviews, and documentary sources, the article examines why the central bank failed both to anticipate the outcomes of its policies in new structural conditions, and to recognize and effectively respond to the escalating process leading to the banking crisis. The analysis finds that even if the Bank of Finland, a field regulator, deliberatively changed its institutional infrastructure and structural conditions, it nevertheless descended into a situation, in which beliefs imprinted during the era of rigid regulation were in misfit with the subsequent institutional patterns. The misfit between beliefs guiding action and institutional conditions resulted in the don Quixote effect; in mismatches, misfires, and opposite-than-intended consequences in policies. The Bank of Finland failed both to control market liquidity and lending, and to secure the stability of financial system. The anticipation of the future and the outcomes of regulatory reforms and policies all dependent on the present of the past performed by cultural logics and heuristics imprinted by the initial conditions of their formation."
2019,"Regulatory Multiplicity: An Exploration of Underpinnings and Constituent Relationships The wide array of regulatory bodies influencing the environment creates a challenge for organizations, particularly when rules overlap or cause divergent expectations. While scholars have noted this tension in the literature and called for a more systematic understanding of the interactions and constraints of regulators, a bias towards taking the purview of the constituent organizations over that of the regulator persists. Our understanding of the drivers of regulatory variation and the impact it has on organizational strategy in response to regulatory change, has not been synthesized into a cohesive framework. This paper aims to do so. Differences driving variation are theorized across two dimensions: the degree of heterogeneity of constituents and the basis of the regulatory body's authority."
2019,"Boundary Objects, Translation Practices and Unstable Entities. Drawing the Boundaries of the Needy Within organisational studies, the translation of boundary objects has provided new ways of understanding success of cooperation across different societal entities without consensus or shared value, mainly stressing the boundary objects` interpretative flexibility. Lately, this one-sided focus of the boundary objects inherent quality has been questioned, stressing the importance of the contextual frames instead. Through a comparative historical study of the boundary objects of Danish philanthropic gift-giving practice 1920-1979 & 1979-2016, the article contributes to organizational studies by returning to the roots of Michael Serres quasi-objects showing that; 1. The quasi-objects are moving agents, bending relationships through temporal and spatial stickiness, neglected in most research. 2. The explanatory strength of boundary objects derives from the intertwined relation of both the quasi-object quality and contextual networks. 3. The translation of boundary objects is a performative act, creating the entities of boundaries. The historical analysis of a foundation owned business will re-consoling boundary objects as a useful analytical category, emphasizing the need of a historical analysis within organisational studies, that do not use history as explanation but instead trace how history is evoked through the boundary objects entanglement of contextual heterogeneities in this process"
2019,"Material Matters: Objects, Value Orientations, and Network Ties Formation in Artistic Collectives In this article, we argue that the effects of materiality on the emergence of social ties are not direct: it is not the sharing of space or objects that necessarily leads to the emergence of ties, but rather the existence of a shared value orientation revealed by materiality. We add to the existing literature on network dynamics in organizations by highlighting the material conditions under which shared value orientation leads to the formation of ties. These effects exist for affective ties but not for professional ties. We empirically back up our claims with a study of three European artistic collectives. Such a creative setting offers a rich socio-material environment (space and objects matter in the arts) and clearly articulated value orientations. Analytically, we use state-of-the-art statistical Multilevel Exponential Random Graph Modelling (MERGM) that has recently opened new prospects in studying the impact of exogenous factors on network ties formation."
2019,"Materiality of Attention: How Selective Use of Materiality Sustains Designing Shared Representations Research on materiality has increasingly drawn attention to how it assists communicative and cognitive processes of group work by highlighting the role materiality plays as material infrastructure, boundary object or epistemic object of work. In this study, building on a six-month ethnography in an architecture firm, I present an inductive qualitative process analysis that accounts for the dynamic interplay between different roles materiality can take over time in the lesser studied processes of heterogeneous group work of constructing shared representations. I focus not only on the what kind and how but also on the when and in what role materiality assisted group work and mitigated impediments arising from heterogeneous group composition. My study shows that multimodal compositions of materiality, jointly and yet selectively employed in different roles, at different moments in time, worked in iteration to background mutual knowledge already created and to foreground following interactions relevant for creating new mutual knowledge. The interplay between materialized backgrounded and foregrounded knowledge sustained group attention on relevant issues and advanced decision making over time."
2019,"Competing Effects of Information Availability and Visibility Enhancement on Post-IPO Media Coverage Building on the literature on media behavior, we examine how visibility enhancing factorsspecifically dramatic events and prominent affiliationsaffect the relationship between availability cascades and media attention and evaluations. We argue visibility enhancing factors have a chronic priming effect that suppresses availability cascade dynamics, due to their higher salience with the media. However, availability the salience of availability cascades is greater when it comes to evaluative judgments, and thus only dramatic events will suppress the effect of availability cascades on positive media coverage. Discrete-time event history analyses on the post-IPO media coverage of 225 initial public offerings support our arguments."
2019,"Do You See What I See? How the Top Managers Frames Influence Shareholder Reactions Though organizational research has offered us important insights regarding how the linguistic frames employed by firms can affect stakeholder assessment, prior research has largely examined the impact of individual frames at a given point of time. However, this likely offers us a simplistic understanding of how shareholders respond to management communication because investors are likely to assess the linguistic frames holisticallythat is, as complex configurations, rather than individually. Building on framing perspective, we take an inductive approach to exploring how cognitive and emotional frames combined in managers communication influence shareholder evaluations of the firm. We adopt a fuzzy set methodology and identify nine language recipes, five that reinforce positive investor impressions when the firm is performing well and four that reinforce negative impressions when firm performance is poor. Our findings offer theoretical and empirical insights to framing research as well as management communication practices."
2019,"Managing Failure: The Effects of Anticipatory and Reactive Strategies Impression management describes the strategies a firm implements to manage evaluator perceptions, an important factor that affects firm financial outcomes. Scholarship to date has considered how firms manage impressions before and after negative events, but considerations of how and why firms use these strategies developed independently. By synthesizing arguments from anticipatory and reactive impression management, I empirically test a novel theoretical framework that treats a firms impression management strategies as path-dependent. I then apply this framework to assess the relative effectiveness of different impression management pairings on firm stock responses, which represent the collective evaluations of firm outsiders. I test these relationships in a sample of late-stage clinical trial terminations. Together, this study seeks to illuminate how firm impression management decisions are more nuanced and interrelated than previous research suggests."
2019,"Firm Media Coverage and Multiple Signals: The Role of Signals Relative Strength and (In)congruence Prior research on the tenor of media coverage has significantly advanced our understanding of how firms react to negative evaluations of the media. Less is known about how firms attract positive or negative media coverage in the first place. Since media build their perception holistically on a combination of multiple elements, we suggest that media coverage is, in fact, the result of a nexus of firm signals that should be considered in combination rather than in isolation. In this paper, we investigate what complex combinations of signals lead to positive or negative media coverage. The context for our study is the medias assessment of the environmental behavior of firms operating in the electric utility sector. Our analyses, based on fsQCA methodology, suggest that it is particularly the relative strength and the level of (in)congruence of signals that drive the direction of media coverage in complex ways. This paper contributes to our understanding of how the media form their assessments about a firm posture in the light of interdependent, simultaneously existing firm-level signals."
2019,"Complements or Substitutes? How Social Approval Assets Drive Product Sales in Peer-to-Peer Platforms Social approval assets like reputation and legitimacy drive stakeholders' choice of transaction partners and products. This paper draws on socio-cognitive perspectives to theorize about how reputation and legitimacy jointly influence consumers' purchase decisions. While previous studies argue that multiple social approval assets reinforce each other, we propose that they will dilute each other's benefits under certain circumstances. Our theory aims to predict product sales in peer-to-peer platforms, in which reviews and ratings provide highly visible reputation cues. Testing our predictions with nearly 900,000 sales transactions on a leading peer-to-peer platform supports our theory."
2019,"Categorical Identity Change: the Privatization of Royal Mail This paper uses findings from a longitudinal case study of the privatization of Royal Mail  the British national postal service organization  to examine internal dynamics triggered by categorical identity changes. By categorical identity change, I refer to changes that alter structural features that determine organizational membership in a particular category, thereby subjecting the organization to a partly new set of rules and expectations, from partly new audiences. This study uncovered the symbolic (e.g. attribution of status and meaning) and substantive (e.g. allocation of resources and discretion) implications of such changes, and how they reflected in a discursive struggle between the employees and the leadership of the organization over who we are as an organization, which, at the time of our study, five years after the change, was still ongoing and partly unresolved. By doing so, the findings provide insights into the previously under-theorized substantive implications of organizational identity claims and their role in discursive identity struggles."
2019,"Idle Hands Are the Devils Tools: Organizational Identity Work as Situated Interaction Studies of identity in organizations have provided valuable insights about how individuals in times of crisis, change, or turbulence make sense of and negotiate understandings of who we are. However, in mundane everyday organizational life, how that which is central and distinctive about the organization is constructed remains underexplored. This research uses the concept of organizational identity work and an ethnographic case study on the rise and fall of an open innovation organization from inception. This study finds that organizational identity work may rather divert from convergence towards values and practices, and risks breaking the organization apart. This study contributes to our understandings of organizational identity work as constructing situated interactions, the unexpectedness of organizational identity construction, and organizational identity as process."
2019,"Battling Identities: How Location Choice is Influenced by Competing Craft Ontologies Organizational identities are often represented as claims of membership into static classification orders. The claims made by organizations are also assumed to be decipherable by audience members. What happens when identities are contested among producers and the underlying organizational claims are hardly scrutable by audiences? We contend that a battle among competing craft ontologies ensues - when producers hold different beliefs about the normative right way of producing something that are not visible to external audiences. Under these conditions, location choice by new entrants represents a meaningful material outcome of this battle. New entrants may contest a given craft ontology along two dimensions: (a) choosing locations whose prior occupant was either of the same or rival identity and (b) by locating closer to rivals. Using quantitative data of French bakeries entries during the period 1998-2017, we examine the competitive behavior of independent and franchised bakeries jointly claiming the identity of the contemporary French artisanal bakery, a label to which both are legally able to assume despite opposing values and methods of breadmaking. Empirical results indicate that both type of bakeries preferred locations where the prior occupant was of the same craft ontology. Nonetheless, independent bakeries opted for head-to-head competition and located more closely to rivals. Conversely, franchised bakeries were more likely to choose locations farther away from rivals. The contributions of our work to existing research are discussed."
2019,"To Change or Not to Change? The Effects of Change in Identity Claims on Cognitive Legitimacy This study explores the effects of change in organizational identity claims on firms cognitive legitimacy. We argue that firms could benefit from having a flexible set of organizational identity claims through signaling flexibility, maintaining congruence between claims and practices, and asserting their distinctiveness among competitors. However, this benefit diminishes as the rate of change increases, because higher rates of change in organizational identity claims create ambiguity and uncertainty for firms audiences. We test our hypothesis in the context of security analysts coverage of public U.S. firms over a period of 20 years (1996-2016). Machine learning techniques are used to develop a new method for measuring change in organizational identity claims."
2019,"Organizational Identity Work in Response to a Category-Wide Issue This paper addresses the interface of research on organizational identity work and strategic categorization. We investigate how producers proceed within their own organization to simultaneously enhance their category identity and their organizational identity in response to an issue that threatens the legitimacy of their core product category. Our empirical study addresses the product category of beer and the issue of alcohol-related harm that threatens the legitimacy of this product. We investigate how organizational actors in Carlsberg Group, a large beer producer, engage in organizational identity work to handle this issue, thereby enhancing the product categorys legitimacy and the organizations position within the beer industry. The organizations identity work paved the way for new, differentiated identity claims that selectively targeted distinct audience groups to improve the legitimacy of the beer category and the organizations position within the industry."
2019,"Appropriating the Refugee Camp. Exploring Volunteers' Spatial Organization Based on an ethnographic study of volunteers in a German refugee emergency camp, established in a former town hall, this article explores the volunteers role during the latest refugee crisis. It adopts a Lefebvrian lens to elucidate how volunteers appropriated the space of the camp in order to match their political agenda. To do so, they selectively mobilised its materiality and history, framing the camp as a private and public space that serves as a laboratory for societal integration. However, these appropriations remained fragile, as the camps present function, its materiality and history pushed back. These results contribute to the literature on refugee camps, showing how volunteers equally contested and co-enacted the camp as a space of control. Moreover, they add to the space literature, unearthing how the function, materiality and history of a space both enables and delimits the ways in which users appropriate it."
2019,"Control in Interactive Space Production. The Role of Lived Space New ways of work and organizing bring about spatial rearrangements where control through space goes beyond the physical walls of the organization. This paper explores the possibility of control through spatial design when organizations produce their space in interaction with the spaces of third organizations. We draw on Lefebvre to analyse longitudinally the space production of an urban film festival where the forms of control through space change over time. The case allows for challenging the notion that spatial control is performed through managerial space design and resisted by bottom-up spatial practices. Rather, the affectively lived space has an important holding power and co-orients the distributed and interactive space production. Attempts of control through conceived space remain limited and necessarily need draw together the existing spatial practices and ways of living space. The paper thus aims to contribute to a more relational, dynamic account of control through space production."
2019,"Recontextualizing Entrepreneurship: Embracing Paradoxes in Liminality Although studies converge to describe tolerance for ambiguity as a strength for entrepreneurs, few, if any, portray ambiguity as contributing to a supportive context. Answering a call to recontextualize entrepreneurship, our research explores how a liminal space, as inherently characterized by ambiguity, is conducive to entrepreneurship. We conducted a 2-year case study in the open collaborative space Le Square, combining 52 days of observation, 43 semi-structured interviews, and over 500 pages of internal and external documents. We depict Le Square as having three major liminal characteristics - an unconventional community, an ephemeral physical embodiment, and a trust-based rudimentary structure, and present how each allows entrepreneurial paradoxes to be embraced. Our study therefore clarifies three main liminal features (social, physico-temporal, and cultural) fundamental to a context supportive of entrepreneurship and demonstrates how entrepreneurs can leverage these features to embrace entrepreneurial paradoxes."
2019,"Crafting Space: The Role of Spatial Practices in Managing Refugee Camps In this paper we explore how refugee camps as specific forms of organizing are actually managed. Based on a contrasting, ethnographic case study of two refugee camps  Oreokastro, Greece and Imvepi, Uganda  we explain how the enactment and crafting of the physical space is fundamental for dealing with the challenges of operating in dynamically emerging refugee camps. Unpacking the managerial practices of aid organizations, we identify three different forms of spatial control: authoritarian, adaptive and collaborative which are enacted through physical or visual boundary setting practices. Our findings shed new light on the importance of enacting and managing space and contribute to our understanding of managing refugee camps in at least three ways: First, we increase our understanding how space is enacted dynamically, second we argue that spheres of influence and spheres of activities can be distinguished through specific spatial practices and third we show that refugee camps are not necessarily total institutions but instead the nature of the camps depends on the way space is actually managed."
2019,"Equality and the Spirit of Capitalism: The Impact of Income Equality on Entrepreneurship I study the impact of income equality on entrepreneurship in emerging market communities. My core argument is that increased income equality will increase entrepreneurial activity because social trust will be higher in communities where community members income is more similar. Furthermore, I argue that the positive effects of income equality on local entrepreneurial activity will be magnified in communities where there is a higher proportion of community members from lower social stratums. The rationale for this theory is that barriers to legitimacy will be lower for those against whom there is institutionalized discrimination; thereby increasing the overall pool of potential entrepreneurs. I test hypotheses drawn from these arguments using data from Mexico that tracks the entrepreneurial activity in every municipality in the country from 2000 to 2011. Results support hypotheses, and the theoretical implications of the results are discussed."
2019,"Why Physical Connectivity Still Matters: New Bridges and Entrepreneurship in Geographic Communities We argue that the confluence of reliance on the local community for resources and support at the time of founding and the inherent segregation across social worlds in geographic communities makes physical connectivity an enduring driver of bricolage opportunities and entrepreneurship. We find that the establishment of new bridges creates vital new arteries for the flow of ideas and the consequent emergence of new organizations in metro areas. Yet, just entirely rebuilding a bridge fails to have the same effects, indicating that the impact of bridges is not merely from the immediate local construction related boom. Further, using the past condition of existing thoroughfares as instruments, we find these effects are identifiably distinct from endogenous forces alone (that might drive both bridge building and subsequent foundings). We also find that greater organizational diversity has a positive moderating effect on foundings post-bridge-building, indicating support for a bricolage argument rather than a customer-access argument alone. The building of new bridges is even more vital in spurring entrepreneurship in highly segregated communities, leading us to conclude that even in the 21st century United States, the emergence of additional connecting infrastructure can have widespread impacts on revitalizing entrepreneurship."
2019,"The Impact of Entrepreneurship on Community Integration: Evidence from a Quasi-Natural Experiment Previous research has focused on the antecedents of entrepreneurship within communities, but little is known about the consequences of entrepreneurship for the community. Focusing on within-community integration, as indicated by violation of community norms through misconduct, we propose that regional boosts of entrepreneurial activity benefit communities. Using employeremployee matched data from Portugal between 2002 and 2010 and an exogenous increase in entrepreneurship, we find support for our claims. Following the enactment of entry deregulation policies which increased entrepreneurship, the incidence of norm violation through misconduct declined within the focal community. We further find that labor market integration of disadvantaged groups is the key mechanism responsible for this effect. Workers from such groups are more likely to (a) transition into entrepreneurship; (b) find employment; and (c) experience improvement in working conditions  when entrepreneurship rates increase. The beneficial effect of entrepreneurship on misconduct was further amplified in communities with greater rates of unemployment and greater income inequality, confirming our prediction that entrepreneurship can serve as a vehicle to improve the standing of low-income communities."
2019,"Civic Engagement in The Creation of Entrepreneurship Our study analyzes the association between civic engagement and entrepreneurship. Analysis of a longitudinal national survey shows that volunteering, a major form of civic engagement, increased the likelihood of starting a new business; volunteering also weakened the negative effect of (1) being a female; and (2) being older on starting a new business. These results are consistent with our argument that volunteering helps people meet others with diverse career backgrounds, obtain non-redundant information, learn bricolage skills for entrepreneurial management, find a liminal moment for career transition, and get a sense of social belonging. Furthermore, volunteering can help overcome challenges related to being female and older age for entrepreneurship. Our study sheds light on unintended economic consequences of social action, thereby complementing existing organizational studies, most of which have been focusing on the anticipable instrumental benefits of social structure."
2019,"Navigating Organizational Stigma Transfer Through Identity Affirmation and Practice Preservation Drawing on evidence from social housing organizations experiencing stigma transfer following the Grenfell Tower tragedy in the UK, we explore how organizations navigate stigma when conventional routes to managing it are unavailable. The literature asserts that stigmatized organizations adjust their practices or use impression management to reduce or remove stigma. Based on interviews, observations, and archival material capturing the history and responses of Tenant Management Organizations (TMOs) to the Grenfell Tower tragedy, we find that their responses were delimited by membership in an already-stigmatized sector (social housing) and focused on navigating the stigma to continue to serve their tenants in the face of increased resource constraints. TMOs responded by: first, reasserting who they were and what they stood for to residents and other key audiences; second, engaging in practices that demonstrated their commitment to tenant management; finally, gaining a stronger collective voice to advocate for tenant management. We discuss implications for organizational stigma theory, including the need to account for historical contexts in which stigmatization is experienced, the interactions between event and core stigma, and how, in contrast to typical defensive responses to stigma, organizations can use their membership in a stigmatized sector to build positive collective identity and voice."
2019,"The Broad versus the Pointed Brush: Status Change, Stigma, Blame and Organizational Failure The paper explores labor-market mechanisms of intra-professional status change following fast organizational failure. Extant research focuses on status change over extended periods of time. We complement that research by undertaking a mixed-method case study of the fast organizational decline and bankruptcy of a former market leader in the global bunker-oil industry. We use unique qualitative and quantitative data to examine the global careers of this firms displaced employees. On the one hand, we find that they suffered no general loss of status. On the other hand, we find that the displaced employees most prone to status loss were those who worked organizationally and geographically proximate to the locus of the organizations failure. We theorize that status change in our case is driven by a mechanism of blamingthe perceived culpability of those displaced employees with comparatively strong association with the organizational failure. We compare this new theoretical notion of blame with the extant notion of stigma, and suggest that while both compensate for imperfect information, stigma entails weaker association with failure. As such, it taints with a broad brush compared to blames pointed brush."
2019,"Identity Exposure as a Remedy for Stigma Transfer Concerns in the Medical Marijuana Market Many legalized markets bear categorical stigma  a vilifying label attached to an industry and its participants  that threatens their performance and survival chances. This happens because audiences avoid engagement with stigmatized organizations to minimize the probability of stigma transfer. Although the literature has explored what strategies stigmatized companies undertake to mitigate their stigma, we know very little whether and how audiences acceptance of stigmatized organizations actually happens, and whether industry collective processes play a role in this acceptance. In this paper, we develop a theory of identity exposure predicting that customers will become less concerned about stigma transfer, as they get exposed to the collective identity of the stigmatized market. We find support to our theorizing in the analyses of customers concerns about stigma in Weedmaps.com  a marijuana-based community  from its inception in 2008 through 2014."
2019,"Stigma Transfer, Social Evaluations, and Category Dynamics in the U.S. Luxury Hotel Industry This paper focuses on category dynamics resulting from changes in the moral character of a category. We explore the process of stigma transfer from individual category members to the overarching category and the full set of category members, particularly when category members have transgressed evaluators moral expectations. We suggest that the stigma associated with the transgressing actions of individual category members leads to stronger and more intense reactions by evaluators in the form of lower ratings and more negative valence judgments towards all members of that category. We further argue that when self-identifying with the transgressing category member, evaluators exhibit stronger positive evaluations and valence judgments towards the transgressing member. Drawing on 20.000+ guests reviews on 129 luxury hotels in major US cities, we test our arguments within the context of the luxury hotel industry in the U.S. We model the victory of hotelier Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections as an exogenous shock and explain how and why his controversial statements and decisions affected social evaluations and category dynamics in the hotel industry. Our findings support the view of a stigma transfer in reaction to the transgression to a single category member. Furthermore, our results suggest that self-identification with the transgressing category member positively influences the intensity and direction of evaluators valence judgments towards that member."
2019,"Network, Strategy, and Time: the Network-Time Compression Hypothesis Temporal discounting is a well-known phenomenon: a reward received today is felt to be worth more than a comparable reward to be received years in the future. We also know that some people are more prone to the phenomenon. In this paper, we look at business planning and strategy as a function of the time compression in temporal discounting. Specifically, we focus on the social environment around a business leader using the network-time compression hypothesis. The hypothesis predicts that more closure in the social network around a person is associated with more time compression such that the future is more severely discounted in favor of the present. Our evidence comes from a probability sample of 700 CEOs leading private manufacturing firms in China. Our results show that CEOs embedded in more closed networks do indeed have shorter time horizons to their business planning, and are less aware of price elasticity in the future market. However, time compression adds nothing to the network prediction of performance. As in work elsewhere, business performance is independent of time compression when network closure is held constant. The results highlight another way in which the network structure around a person is associated with individual differences in cognition, and are consistent with results elsewhere showing that temporal discounting varies within individuals over time as a function of their social situation."
2019,"No Bandwidth, no Problem: Informational Mechanisms for Variation and Selection in Open Networks Informational advantages play a central role in explanations linking firms network positions to their performance outcomes. However, current theory focuses almost exclusively on information that increases a firms exposure to variation, adopting the assumption that information from the network is more useful for firms performance outcomes when more diverse, and when acquired at a faster rate. This paper uses a simulation analysis that formalizes extant network models to highlight an oversight in this logic. The analysis suggests (1) that informational redundancy among alters in open networks enhances performance by enabling actors to better select from the multitude of options presented in the network, and (2) that absent informational redundancy among alters, firms in open networks demonstrate more effective selection processes if novel information is acquired at a slower rate. The consequence of these two results is that the strongest long-run performance advantages for open networks may occur in precisely the social contexts thought most incompatible with open networks, strong bandwidth tradeoff contextsthose where relational factors such as trust and shared cognition are strong preconditions for information transfer between partners. These findings demonstrate the importance of better accounting for informational mechanisms that enhance firms selection of practices from the network."
2019,"Beyond Brokerage Position: Deployment of Multiple Brokering Behaviors and Impacts on Performance Brokerage and brokering are ubiquitous and consequential phenomena in organizations. Classic research overly relies on a structural definition of brokerage and holds a homogeneous view of brokerage phenomena. Recent research has proposed a behavioral construal of brokerage phenomena and formulated three forms of brokering behaviors, i.e., collaborative, mediation, and separation brokering. We systematically examine the effects of these brokering behaviors on individual performance. With empirical data from research scientists at an R&D; Center, we find that different brokering behaviors distinctly impacted performance. Moreover, we find a positive externality on the receiving side of collaborative brokering. However, we also uncover a too-much-of-a-good-thing effect of collaborative brokering on the focal brokers performance. Inspired by Obstfelds insight that broker repertories consist of different combinations of these behaviors (Obstfeld, 2017: 42), we complement the current study with a person-centered approach. Using latent profile analysis, we identify four configural profiles of brokers: non-brokers, average brokers, disjoiners, and bridges. The result provides a conceptually useful representation of deployment of multiple brokering behaviors, which yields insights consistent with those from the variable-centered approach. Overall, this paper illuminates the complexity and richness of brokering phenomena."
2019,"How Social Enterprises Navigate Institutional Complexity in an Authoritarian State Social enterprises have emerged throughout the world as a promising solution to grand challenges such as poverty, environmental degradation, and human rights violations. Although these issues tend to be more acute in authoritarian regimes where the state plays a dominant role, little research has systematically examined how social enterprises perceive and manage the unique institutional complexity in those contexts. Drawing from rich qualitative data on 42 social enterprises in China, we find that the dominant state logic shapes a distinctive form of institutional complexity: the key tensions arise from the state and social welfare logics and the state logic can shift the relationships between market and social welfare logics. We also uncover three strategies that Chinese social enterprises employconformity, engagement, and evasionto manage the conflict between state and social welfare logics. In particular, we find that the engagement strategy was most favored by social enterprises to help develop mutually beneficial relations with the state. This study makes three contributions to research on institutional complexity, social enterprises, and hybrid organizing."
2019,"Navigating Identity Tensions with Oppositional Collective Identity: A Case of B Corp Organizations With increasing awareness that tensions between multiple organizational identities can contribute to mission drift and suboptimal performance, we require deeper insight into how organizations navigate these tensions. In an inductive study on B Corp certified for-profit companies, we investigate whether and how organizations draw on an oppositional, or ideologically-opposed, collective identity to navigate tensions among their own multiple identities. Our findings uncover three strategies organizations leverage to draw on the oppositional collective identity to navigate these tensions. This study shows how an oppositional collective identity can provide a space for an organization to connect and ground an ideologically-opposed organization-level identity and synergize compatibilities with their other identities. In this way, organizations are able to maintain core claims of their organization-level identities, reframe them in ways that generate stronger complementarities between them, and generate higher fidelity between identities and actions."
2019,"Managing Attentional Challenges in Social Enterprises: The Key Role Board Structure and Processes We examine how boards of directors enable social enterprises to sustain their attention on social and commercial goals. Drawing on a comparative case study of eight work integration social enterprises (WISEs), we identify key board-level mechanisms that, when combined, help boards hold their organizations attention on dual goals. Specifically, we find that WISEs with board members who collectively represent the social and commercial logics are more likely to maintain their attention on dual goals. However, they are also more likely to experience highly distracting governance crises. We further find that the WISEs that are able to avoid these crises rely on a combination of board-level structural and processual arrangements. They employ a stable board structure in which one group of board members representing one logic holds the majority of decision rights, yet integrates the perspective of the minority group representing the other logic. Bridging work processes, which refers to activities undertaken by a board member to ensure that members representing different logics understand each other, enables this systematic engagement with the minority. With this attention-holding model, we contribute to scholarship on hybrid organizations, boards, and organizational attention by uncovering the neglected yet essential attention-holding function of boards in hybrid organizations."
2019,"The Emotionality of Social Enterprises: Mechanisms and Challenges for Generating Emotional Energy Despite the clear importance of emotions for social enterprises, theory on social entrepreneurship still lacks a framework for understanding why emotions are so important for these organizations. Further, theory on social entrepreneurship lacks a framework for understanding the challenges faced by social entrepreneurs in attempting to mobilize their internal and external audiences from an emotion-based perspective. Building on the sociological work that has been carried out on emotions, I provide a framework for understanding how a collective emotionality is manifested in and by social enterprises. I suggest that social enterprises leverage three mechanisms for generating emotional energy: (1) pursuing meaningful ideals, (2) nourishing a vibrant emotional culture, and (3) granting power and status to individuals with less power and lower status. By analyzing these factors, I reveal the challenges that social enterprises face in scaling up, challenges that are relatively unknown compared with the well-explored challenges of balancing social and financial objectives. As social enterprises attempt to scale up their objectives, organizational growth exerts pressures on these efforts, putting these organizations at risk of emotional dispersion."
2019,"Timing Is Money: The Flexibility and Precariousness of Login Employment In the gig economy, workers gain scheduling flexibility but lose guarantees of paid workload. Since a schedule without work has no value to workers, the size and variance of workload within an observed schedule become key dimensions of precariousness. Using detailed work data on over ten thousand agents working in a virtual call center (VCC), which pioneered a gig-based on-demand employment model fifteen years ago, we show that workers control over their schedule does little to enhance employment security. The only simultaneous increase in size and reduction in variance of workload comes from trading off flexibility for security by making advance commitments to a specific schedule in exchange for priority in receiving calls. The case gives the first evidence of an innovative economic work arrangement  Login Employment  that combines formal relational contracts with informal directive control and thus becomes a mirror image of the traditional employment relationship."
2019,"Exploring Team Overlap and Knowledge Diversity in Fluid Teams: An Empirical Study in Robotic Surgery In organizations that focus on the execution of team-based tasks, the concept of team overlap refers to the extent to which individuals, who are part of a team involved in the execution of one task, are concurrently members of other teams. Organizations thus learn to better match individuals to tasks by constantly reconfiguring fluid teams that integrate diverse knowledge possessed by external overlapping members with knowledge possessed by focal members. Combining existing theories, original fieldwork and data on 1671 robotic surgery operations performed by more than 100 surgeons within a large university polyclinic during a four-year period, we study the relation between team overlap, knowledge diversity and team performance. We reconstruct operational performance in terms of surgery times recorded automatically by a robot surgeon operated by two human surgeons. We account for knowledge diversity among surgeons by measuring heterogeneity of experience profiles, accumulated performing surgeries in different clinical categories. After controlling for a series of individual and clinical factors, we find that team overlap is positively related to team performance, documenting an increased knowledge sharing among surgeons embedded in communities of shared external partners. Furthermore, we find that experience heterogeneity of shared external partners is negatively related to team performance but its effect is mitigated when the experience of focal members is also heterogeneous, and thus teams possess the necessary absorptive capacity to integrate external knowledge. We conclude by discussing implications for organization theory and team reconfiguration dynamics."
2019,"Bringing Control back in: Using Coworking Spaces for Motivation-as-Control in Independent Work Independent workers are increasingly relocating their working environment from an office, their home, or other locations to coworking spaces, which offer them high-end infrastructure combined with a community-infused atmosphere. Curiously, though, relocating the locus of work into a coworking space leads to a seemingly paradoxical situation for independent workers: independence in task execution and self-imposed constraint in task organization that results from the fixed and institutionalized structure of coworking spaces. Drawing on self-determination theory and combining it with an extensive interview study of coworkers in Germany, we offer an understanding of coworking as a means for independent workers to apply self-induced but externally enforced control over domains of work organization that are inherently hard to control, while at the same time allowing them to maintain high levels of autonomy in their work execution. We find and theorize on four categories of motivation-as-control."
2019,"How Control-Trust Dynamics Influence Trust and Control Perceptions This paper demonstrates that the ways managers combine their applications of control and demonstrations of their trustworthiness produce differential effects on the subordinates trust and control perceptions. When managers either apply outcome controls and demonstrate their integrity or apply clan controls and demonstrate their consideration, they produce higher levels of subordinate trust and decreased subordinate perceptions of managerial control. However, when managers apply behavior controls and demonstrate their capability, managers produce lower levels of subordinate trust and increased subordinate perceptions of managerial control. A key element that drives this moderating effect s is the level of behavioral autonomy that managers provide to their subordinates. The paper concludes with a discussion of how this perspective advances research on organizational control, organizational trust, and control-trust dynamics."
2019,"Implications of Prospect Theory for the Asymmetric Behavior of Costs A growing body of research documents an asymmetric behavior of costs, implying that costs rise more in response to sales increases than they drop for sales decreases. Also known as cost stickiness, this cost behavior is ascribed to managerial decisions on resource commitment. In this study, we build on core components of prospect theory to further explore this asymmetry and examine how such cost asymmetry may be affected by risk preferences in managerial decision making when firms face declining (increasing) activity. In particular, we hypothesize how risk taking (aversion) in the domain of losses (gains) as well as industry performance as a reference point for firm performance act as determinants of managerial decision making on resource commitment decisions. To test these hypotheses, we use secondary unbalanced panel data on 3,558 companies across nine industry sectors from 26 countries around the world over the period of six years (2008-2013). We contribute to existing literature on asymmetric cost behavior in considering the role of risk preferences in different domains (losses and gains) as well as the role of industry performance as a reference point for managerial decision making on resource commitment."
2019,"Risk or Uncertainty? The Effect of Performance on Risk Taking in the Mutual Fund Industry  Prospect theory suggests that increases in performance reduce risk-taking such that managers are risk averse when their performance is above aspiration levels, but risk seeking when their performance is below. However, the theory of capability cues argues that increases in performance lead to more self-confidence and therefore induce riskier behaviors. This study reconciles these contradicting theories by differentiating between risk and uncertainty. Risk refers to variations in the probability distribution of an outcome, while uncertainty involves situations that lack sufficient information. I propose that improvements in performance lead managers to engage in less risk but more uncertainty. Using a rich dataset of 2,275 mutual funds from 2000 to 2015, I find that as performance increases, fund managers choose stocks that have less volatility, or risk, but also less coverage by analysts and thus more uncertainty."
2019,"Performance Feedback and Information Processing: How Do Organizations Regulate Risk-Taking? The Behavioral Theory of the Firm has often viewed risk-taking as an almost mechanistic response to performance feedback. In this study, we develop a more fine-grained model of the performance feedback risk-taking relationship and argue that performance feedback drives how decision makers process information regarding risky opportunities. Specifically, we argue that organizations process information regarding two attributes characterizing risky opportunities (magnitude of potential losses/gains and the likelihood of adverse/positive outcomes) depending upon two dimensions of performance feedback (performance level and deadline proximity). We test our ideas by analyzing 26,514 fourth down decisions from the National Football League (NFL) between seasons 20092016. Specifically, we show that organizational risk-taking becomes more sensitive to the magnitude of the potential losses/gains as the distance of performance from the aspiration level increases (both below and above aspirations), and less sensitive to the likelihood of adverse/positive outcomes as performance improves above the aspiration level; we further show that as the deadline to meet the goal approaches, organizational risk-taking becomes less sensitive to the two attributes characterizing the risky opportunity and more so to the current level of performance. Keywords: Risk-taking, Behavioral Theory of the Firm, Aspirations, Performance Feedback"
2019,"Stakeholder Sentiment, Problemistic Search, and Firm Risk Taking: A Behavioral Investigation Drawing on problemistic search arguments, we suggest that stakeholder sentiments affect firms search and risk taking. Specifically, similar to the logic underlying performance feedback, we suggest that a shortfall in stakeholder sentiments from historically and socially derived aspirations, affects firms decision making. In comparison to financial performance indicators, we suggest that stakeholder sentiments describe a more comprehensive picture about the multi-dimensionality of managers goal perspective and, hence, adds value to our current understanding of problem driven search."
2019,"How Structurally Embedded Indirect Ties Stimulate the Acquisition of Difficult-to-Transfer Resources Organizational theorists are interested in the flow of resources within social networks, especially difficult-to-transfer resources like tacit knowledge and influence. For such resources, research has emphasized the role of direct relational ties and neglected the role of structurally embedded indirect ties. Given the heavy investments needed to build and sustain direct ties, a better understanding of how indirect ties can affect the acquisition of difficult-to-transfer resources is essential. In this study, we elaborate on distinct structural and relational characteristics of an individuals indirect ties to show how they can facilitate the acquisition of tacit knowledge and influence. We argue that more indirect ties, especially those that favor the resource provider, and closer ties between resource provider and mutual acquaintances than between resource acquirer and acquaintances will increase the acquisition of tacit knowledge and influence. We test our model using survey data from marketing and sales managers in a global pharmaceutical company. Our study offers unique insights into how directivity, the directional property, of structurally embedded ties can shape collective understanding, mutual trust, social reciprocity, and sanction to stimulate the flow of difficult-to-transfer resources."
2019,"Exploring the Causal Effect of Network Brokerage on Newcomers Adjustment: Evidence from a RCT The structure of informal relationships is a relevant but understudied component of newcomers organizational socialization  i.e. the process through which new organizational members become organizational insiders. In this paper, we investigate whether developing an organizational network rich in structural holes can help newcomers to more successfully adjust to their new work environment, potentially impacting their organizational knowledge, their ability, task performance and creativity. We test these hypotheses using a randomized field experiment that features a three-wave, longitudinal sample collected from a population of 646 newcomersupervisor dyads, spanning a wide range of industries. Our results separately contribute to the literatures on organizational networks and organizational socialization, and have practical implications for HR managers."
2019,"The Benefits of Adopting Powerful Knowledge or Connecting to Powerful People During a Merger During a merger the acquiring organization is often a dominant force. It overwhelms the target organization and replaces its norms, routines, and formal structures. In this study I consider the relative benefits of referent power and informational power in terms of getting ahead. Is it best to connect with powerful people, or is it better to learn things powerful people know? Over a fourteen month period immediately following the initial integration, I estimate the influence of powerful ties and powerful knowledge on relative changes to salary. Topics are extracted from the email content and then estimated to belong to either the dominant organization, or to higher ranking members of the organization. I measure how much of this powerful knowledge is then integrated into conversations, and how employees change their networks to connect to powerful people. Findings suggest information from the high ranks, and connecting to people in the dominant organization were both beneficial to members of the target organization. Further, adopting the knowledge of powerful people facilitated the creation of new ties to those powerful people. These results suggest formal strategies of information and knowledge exchange could help make merger integrations more successful."
2019,"Heated Atmosphere: Organizational Emotions and Field Structuring in Online Climate Change Debates We use an organizational issue field to conceptualize how organizations partake in the signification of amorphous, yet intransigent issues  such as climate change. Following a network conception, field structure is captured as the linkages between organizations. Besides meaning systems and values, emotional expressions can affect the positioning of organizations within the field and, hence, how they define, debate, and address the core issue. Thus, we ask: How do framings, values, and emotion affect the structure of an organizational issue field? We answer our research question by synthesizing theories of fields, structuring, and emotion. By completing a network analysis of the online climate change debate, we find that organizations are most likely to link to other organizations expressing similar emotions  resembling organizational emotional entrainment. Expressed emotionality influences organizations positions in an organizational issue field even beyond cognitive framings like issue stance, values like moral worldviews, and typical in-group clusterings like organizational type or political orientation."
2019,"Fear and Deinstitutionalization: The Case of Identity Threat by Mass Immigration This article theorizes on the dynamics of collective fear in deinstitutionalization processes by which an established organizational practice weakens and erodes. I extend current theorizing through an in-depth historical study of the emergence and decline of the so-called Swiss guest worker regime between 1946 and 1973. This institutional arrangement governed the contracting of labor from abroad in the context of an economic boom and severe labor short-age after the Second World War. The study focuses on the disruption period in the 1960s, in which public opinion withdrew approval for the practice of recruiting guest workers on a large scale. The disapproval was motivated by the perceived danger to the Swiss national identity from mass immigration, which manifested itself in a collective experience of fear, namely the fear of alienation (berfremdungsangst). Drawing from the structural theory of emotions and the analogy of disease progression through a population, my findings show how the construction and constant resurfacing of collective fear at the society level shapes conditions and dynamics at the field level, in which field members cannot stop but only delay a deinstitutionalization project. In all, while the institutional literature emphasizes both the function of fear in processes of institutional stability and the power of institutional actors to control collective fear, this study suggests that the eliciting of fear is a potent discursive means to weaken and disrupt established institutional pillars."
2019,"Emotional Competence and Post-Crisis Behavior within Organizations In the aftermath of a crisis, organizational actors face environments of high uncertainty which challenge rational models of decision making. As a consequence, emotional processes can meaningfully shape social interactions in crisis contexts. In this study, we adopt an interactionist perspective to theorize and test how interaction-generated affective impressions guide social action in the post-crisis period. Following cultural-normative organizational scholarship, we suggest that interactions within organizations are structured by norms relating to the display of emotions. Consequently, interactions utilizing appropriate emotional displays generate emotional uplift, and inappropriate emotional displays cause negative affect. We theorize that over the course of repeated interactions, such interpersonal emotional exchanges can lead to the formation of affective impressions of interaction partners. In times of crisis, actors facing high uncertainty and cognitive constraints utilize these affective impressions in determining the target and volume of their interactions. Overall, we make a case that emotional competenceresponsiveness to the emotional displays of others in the organization over timeshapes post-crisis interactional outcomes for individuals by moderating the relationship between proximity to the crisis event and their social distancing and withdrawal outcomes. Through an analysis of 0.8 million instant messages exchanged by 119 employees of a hedge fund raided due to allegations of insider trading, we show that actors with low emotional competence experience greater post-raid distancing from peers and are more likely to exhibit withdrawal behaviors, as compared to those with high emotional competence."
2019,"To Hate or to Love? Changing the Emotion Rules of Institutions This study examines how emotion rules, that are core to an institution, change. We do so through an inductive longitudinal analysis of Chinas transition away from a Soviet-style planned economy. Not only did the transition entail the dismantling and replacement of political and regulatory institutions, it necessitated fundamental changes to the value systems underpinning economic activity. By tracing how emotion rules were altered as the Chinese government rolled out its economic reforms, this study seeks to advance research on emotions and institutions by elaborating discursive emotion work strategies. Our findings suggest that discursive emotion work at the societal level is likely to differ from those operating at other levels of analysis  not just because of the scale, but because the discursive strategies need to have appeal to or persuade a very diverse and heterogeneous audience. Moreover, the top-down approach adopted by the Chinese Communist Party stands in stark contrast to the more bottom-up strategies that have been advanced in the literature to date."
2019,"Corporate Demography and Income Inequality: Revisited We replicate and extend Sorenson and Sorensens (2007) study how corporate demography shapes workforce wage inequality across region-industries by: (i) replicating their original results from Danish regions in 1992-1998 using a close to identical dataset of industry-regions in neighboring Sweden during the same time-period, (ii) extending the study to 2012 to gauge the corporate demography  wage inequality relationship during a period of rapidly increasing inequality, and (iii) expanding the scope of the model by two new measures of organizational form diversity. Our findings suggest a fairly strong test-retest validity, an enhanced effect of corporate demography over time, but that more nuanced measure of organization form diversity do not necessarily enhance the models explanatory power."
2019,"Towards Dirty Realism in Inequality Research: is Inequality Always Dirty? We contribute to research on organizations and inequality by providing a more nuanced picture of how organizations  through their employment practices  shape the negative consequences of income inequality. We reply to a recent call for more dirty realism in inequality research by extending the research focus to actual life satisfaction consequences for individuals facing inequality. Building on procedural utility theory and self-determination theory, we hypothesize that adverse effects of disadvantaged income positions on individuals life satisfaction can be mitigated by the way organizations arrange work. We find empirical support for two important aspects of individuals job quality mitigating the negative effects of disadvantaged income positions: individuals in disadvantaged income positions perceive a relatively lower decrease in life satisfaction when their levels of job autonomy and job security are high. In sum, we find that income inequality is always dirty, but less so when individuals have job autonomy and job security. We conclude with a discussion of the research implications of emphasizing employment practices as a key determinant for shaping the impact of income inequality on overall life satisfaction in society."
2019,"The Paradox of Minority Conformity: Same-gender Referencing among Female Financial Analysts This paper examines minority actors conformity behavior. We focus on the influence of minority token status, or skewed proportions of demographic distribution in a group as contextual factors of conformity. Through my analyses of financial analysts earnings forecasts, we find that minority actors, specifically female analysts, tend to conform to the consensus forecast of the entire analyst population due to their minority status. More interestingly, we also find that female analysts tend to conform, rather than deviate, to other female counterparts due to self-stereotyping. To examine the influence of culture as another contextual factor, we further conduct a cross-country difference between individualist vs. collectivist cultures. This same-gender conformity for female analysts, paradoxically, was greater in the U.S than in China. Extending prior socio-psychological research on culture, we argue that this same-gender conformity is contextually derivedan outcome of minority status which arises from the skewed gender distribution and cultural stereotypes towards gender role in the professional society."
2019,"North-South Relations and Inclusivity in Management Scholarship: A Call for Reflexive Hybridity In this essay, we build upon postcolonial theory and our own experiences to take issue with two opposing but equally unhelpful tendencies. Complacent globalism ignores the historical enmeshment between colonisers and colonised, and it normalises the assumptions of the Northern mainstream and perpetuates a view of the Global South as some deficient backwater, ignoring important signs of how these Southern contexts might be harbingers of a world to come. Indigenous isolation reacts to such complacent globalism by focusing inward and, in so doing, creates enclaves that isolate local contexts and knowledge from ideas and critique from elsewhere. As a response to both these tendencies, we recommend a posture of reflexive hybridity to scholars across the tenuous and enmeshed categories of North and South, engendering purposeful dialogue between diverse perspectives from different contexts to constructively challenge each others assumptions and understanding."
2019,"Inside Jobs: The Employment of Internal and Domestic Hires in High-skill and High-pay Positions Individuals transition across organizational boundaries (internal vs. external hires) and/or national boundaries (domestic vs. foreign residency hires) for employment opportunities. Building upon theories pertaining to human capital, information, and international skill transferability, we examine how mobility across such boundaries may be associated with employment in high-skill and high-pay jobs. We leverage unique records regarding the employment transitions of all immigrant workers seeking labor certification at all U.S. organizations over a 33-month period obtained through U.S. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and the U.S. Department of Labor (DoL) Case Disclosure Program. For each of these transitions, U.S. DoL agents review the characteristics of a described job opportunity and determine the jobs skill level and base (minimum) salary. These determinations are reached with no knowledge of the worker that fills these positions (including education, work experience, or job entry pathway  data that is available for this study through FOIA disclosures). Jobs filled by internal and domestic residency hires tend to be classified as high skill with high base salaries, relative to those filled by external and foreign residency hires. Further, employers tend to offer larger discretionary salary increases above the base salary for domestic than foreign residency hires, while internal hires receive smaller increases than external hires. In explaining this latter result, we find positive returns to workers months of prior external work experience, but statistically insignificant returns to months of prior internal work experience. We conclude by discussing implications for theories of labor market mobility, career transitions, and employment-based immigration."
2019,"How Organizations Perpetuate Social Inequality  The Simultaneity of Advantage and Disadvantage Access to the upper echelons of organisations has long been proven to be unequal, as women, racial minorities, and lower-class members are found to be segregated into lower-ranking jobs within organisations. We look at how organisations produce inequality by adopting an intersectional lens and integrating insights from gender-, race-, and class-based inequality into a common framework of inequality processes in organisations. We suggest that stereotyping of individuals and archetyping, a category-based mental model, of job roles jointly privilege some individuals while marginalising others. The extent to which the individuals stereotype and the job role archetype converge (diverge) drives the strength of the positive (negative) bias in the evaluation of the job role fit. Thus, stereotyping and archetyping jointly contribute to the recreation of existing structures by driving systemic job segregation. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we integrate previously separated literatures to show that the mechanism underlying inequality processes in organisations is the same for gender, race, and class. Second, we illustrate the importance of job role archetypes in the recreation of existing inequality patterns. In doing so, we contribute to the inequality literature and specifically to the institutionalisation of inequality. We discuss further implications for research and practice and how these insights help building more inclusive organisations."
2019,"Bridging Cultural Distance in Elite Occupations: The Case of a Media Company Elite professions and professional service firms have a well-known tendency to recruit among candidates with privileged educational and cultural background, thus playing a role in the reproduction of social inequality. Even when elite firms hire more diverse populations of employees, the socialization and career prospects of these employees tend to be poorer than those of the more privileged employees. It is thus crucial to better understand how employees from less culturally or economically privileged backgrounds can be integrated within elite professional firms. In this paper, to better understand how such integration might or might not occur, we study the recruitment and career trajectories at an elite media firm of six cohorts of employees from a socio-economically underprivileged background. The candidates were hired for a two-year apprenticeship. At the end of the apprenticeship, the candidates were offered or not a permanent position within the firm. We thus compare the candidates who are offered a permanent position within the firm and those who are not in order to tease out key dynamics that allow for more successful integration."
2019,"Whos the Boss? The Effect of Gender, Race, and Class on Workplace Authority We analyze a representative U.S. sample to show the effects of inherited privilege in the domains of race, gender and class on the likelihood that an individual will obtain a position of workplace authority. Inherited privilege is shown to be substantial, and approximately equal in magnitude, across all three of those sources. On average over the period we study, someone born to a disadvantaged position in any of those categories is 25% less likely to become a boss than someone born to an advantaged position. We further document trends in inherited privilege with an imprinting approach, examining whether individuals born into particular legal and cultural contexts experience different paths to workplace authority. Individuals born into low-class positions face the biggest disadvantage for much of the period we study but begin to enjoy better outcomes for cohorts born after the passage of the Civil Rights Act, such that for the latest cohorts we observe there is no discernible disadvantage from low-class origins. For women and blacks, the pattern is reversed. Individuals born into those groups in later years but before the passage of the Civil Rights Act were increasingly likely to achieve positions of workplace authority. In both of those categories, their odds get worse for cohorts born after the Civil Rights Act, with the effect being particularly pronounced for blacks. The disadvantage faced by women is a function of motherhood. Women who are not mothers achieve workplace authority at rates comparable to men."
2019,"Ambiguous Authority and Hidden Hierarchy: Collective Leadership in a Professional Service Firm This study examines the response of a professional service firms (PSF's) senior leadership group to the banking crisis of 2008. It contributes to collective leadership theory, by developing a detailed analysis of the composition, interaction and situation of a collective leadership group, and to PSF scholarship, by representing a rare and in-depth analysis of leadership dynamics in this context. It highlights how professional peers deliberately construct and amplify ambiguity in both the composition and authority of the collective leadership group. It identifies intuitive mutual adjustment as their prevailing pattern of interaction, and emphasizes how this is facilitated by social embeddedness. It finds that, in a situation of crisis, a hidden hierarchy is revealed and the prevailing pattern of interaction changes to become what this study terms channeled mutual adjustment. It develops a model of collective leadership dynamics under ambiguous authority which demonstrates how cohesion can be maintained, and it identifies the distinctive practices which characterize intuitive and channeled mutual adjustment. It further contributes to PSF and plural leadership scholarship by demonstrating how leaders can exercise considerable informal authority under the cloak of ambiguity, highlighting the significance of the individual leader within plural leadership, and raising questions about the performance of plurality within supposedly plural leadership groups."
2019,"Momentum and Inferential Strategies: How Rational are R&D; Investment Decisions? This study uses longitudinal data on Spanish manufacturing firms between 1998 and 2012 to provide a microfoundational account of R&D; investment decisions. While there is evidence for both momentum and inferential strategies as mechanisms guiding organizational action in decision contexts characterized by uncertainty, prior research has tended to study the two behavioral strategies in silos. I investigate the two strategies in a single setting and shed light on the role of historical and social performance feedback in propelling momentum and inferential processes. Although I find momentum to be prevalent, performance below aspiration levels fosters inference. However, this effect is weakened by external and internal information ambiguity. These findings offer important contributions to existing research on behavioral strategies as meso-level mechanisms explaining persistence and change in organizations."
2019,"The Benefits of Not Being Known for Something: How the Reputation of a New Organisation Evolves Through a rich five year longitudinal single case study, we show that there is a dynamic relationship between how reputation evolves over time, stakeholder salience, and strategic ambiguity. We find that perceptions of the subject organization change over time, according to various stakeholders, as different factors become more or less salient to them. We present two theoretical surprises. First, despite some literature arguing that prominence is an important building block of reputation, we argue that it is not a sufficient condition for new organizations unless stakeholders perceive the organization as relevant for them. Second, although the literature suggests that reputation is an antidote to strategic ambiguity, we find that some ambiguity can help organizations to navigate different and sometimes competing stakeholder perceptions. Overall, we show how organizations can navigate the challenges of building and sustaining reputation among different stakeholders over time to ensure organizational longevity."
2019,"To be Vague, or Not to Be: Firms Avoidance of Vague Language and Performance below Aspirations In numerous social settings, individuals and organizations are expected to communicate with clear language. Nevertheless, firms actually use vague language in communicating with external audiences (e.g., shareholders and securities analysts). The obfuscation hypothesis in the finance and accounting literature suggests that firms use vague language to hide adverse information such as poor performance. Since this hypothesis has received mixed support in empirical research, this study incorporates the literature on impression management and performance aspirations and proposes the persuasiveness hypothesis: firms avoid using vague language when their performance is below aspirations. We used Hillers communication vagueness dictionary and conducted content analysis of Form 10-K of firms in the U.S. high-tech industries. We found support to the persuasiveness hypothesis, rather than the obfuscation hypothesis, that firms use vague language less when they receive negative performance-feedback."
2019,"Theorizing on Pperational Excellence: A Capability-Based Approach According to reports, two out of every three continuous improvement initiatives fail. Nevertheless, running operational excellence (OPEX) initiatives rank highly on top managers agendas. Within these initiatives, practitioners conduct diverse programmes (e.g., lean management, Six Sigma, total quality management, Kaizen) and use myriad tools (e.g., design of experiments, analysis of variance, statistical process control, Kano model). However, these programmes and tools are yet to be incorporated in extant organizational theories. We propose the capability-based view and, in particular, the dynamic capabilities view to integrate OPEX into a reliable theory of the firm. We propose the concept of OPEX capabilities in order to explain the varying success of OPEX initiatives. Through the notion of equifinality, we clarify how different OPEX programmes constitute the same capability. We present a set of propositions concerning the concept of OPEX capability, its development, and its relation to the reconfiguration capacity of a firms dynamic capability and, thus, to the effectiveness of a firms strategy. Finally, we offer three ways of operationalization of the OPEX capability."
2019,"We Act Therefore We Are: A Theory of Action Driven Strategy This study examines the effects of competitive actions on strategic choice. Competitive actions can be sources of strategy as they expose the firm to its competitive environment, generating salient experience and knowledge that narrow managerial selection of strategic alternatives such as diversification. Results confirm the theoretical prediction that competitive actions are drivers of strategy and show that characteristics of competitive actions such as scope, and the use of action repertoires can directly influence the adoption of diversification. They indicate that connections between competitive behavior and strategy are relevant and that firms might access knowledge and experience previously obtained in the marketplace to decide which strategies to take."
2019,"Mid-Size Firm Growth: The Process and Empirical Examination of Resource Orchestration by Managers From rich description in qualitative research, we unpack the interaction of relationship and resource variables (R&R;) that are orchestrated for growth by managers. We test profiles of R&R; interactions over practical stage boundaries, revealing within-stage growth as an R&R; configuration process and between-stage growth as an R&R; reconfiguration process. Our tests uncover comparative case-related growth cognitions, intentions, and actions by managers, offering a finer-grained model of organic mid-sized business growth. We focus on R&R; given that Penrose (1959) and resource-based theory suggest that resources (which are broadly defined) form the basis for firm growth. We contribute by unpacking what R&R; variables foster mid-sized business growth as well as how, where, and when they do so. Finally, we conclude by discussing potential implications."
2019,"Being Extraordinary: How CEOs Special Names Predict Their Distinctive Strategies and Performance We integrate recent theories and studies about the relational self with studies on uncommon names to explain why the uncommonness of CEOs' names is an important predictor of their strategic decisions and firm performance. Our theory explains why CEOs with more special names tend to 1) pursue strategies that deviate more from industry average, 2) select more top executive team members who have unconventional backgrounds, 3) make more strategic changes, and 4) deliver better financial performance. Using data about name commonness from the U.S. Social Security Administration and financial data of S&P; 1500 firms, we find strong support for our theoretical predictions. This study identifies the uncommonness of CEOs names as an important and unstudied characteristic of top executives that can explain a wide range of major organizational outcomes and offers a novel perspective to understand these strategic issues."
2019,"A Motivational Theory of Network Formation, Change, and Structuring Drawing on the self-regulation and brokerage literatures, we develop theory to help explain individuals motivation to form, manipulate, and configure their social network relationships. Research on social networks has often treat[ed] motivation and opportunity as one and the same (Burt, 1992: 80). A recent strand of research has begun to question this approach and pay greater attention to the focal actors motivation in network development and relationship utilization. Our theorizing helps advance this emerging stream of research by exploring how motivational orientations driven by regulatory foci (i.e., prevention and promotion) affect relationship management processes, including formation, maintenance, dissolution, and reconstitution of ties. Building on two forms of relational orientations (i.e., tertius iungens and gaudens, or union and disunion), we develop a typology that illustrates distinctive paths of actor network development, predicting the nature of network structuring in each configuration, both at the core and the periphery of the ego network."
2019,"Brokers in Disguise: The Interplay of Actual and Socially Perceived Brokerage on Performance Recent research in social network theory suggests that actors with an open network face an idea-action tradeoff: Increases in the ability to generate innovative ideas might come at the cost of a decreased ability to implement them. By linking otherwise disconnected individuals, brokers are exposed to non-redundant information that can be recombined in novel ways. Those that are being brokered, however, may develop a belief that the broker is not one of them, thus triggering skepticism of the brokers motives that can hinder brokers ability to get their ideas accepted. Integrating insights from cognitive social structures into structural holes theory, I argue that others perceptions of a focal actors brokerage opportunities constitute a critical contingency explaining the association between brokerage and individual performance. Specifically, brokers who are misperceived to occupy dense social networks will extract more advantages from their network positions. Using field data from a consulting firm, I test the interaction effect between actual brokerage and socially perceived brokerage on employees performance. I find that employees spanning structural holes are more likely to be evaluated as high-performers when their colleagues perceive them to have closed rather than open networks, and that relational trust is the underlying mechanism driving this effect."
2019,"If Brokers Could Choose Their Utility Function, Would They Choose to Minimize Constraint? Extant literature has emphasized the benefits accrued to individuals who span structural holes. Yet, agent-based simulation has suggested that if all actors in a network strove for structural holes, gains would be depleted. Through this paper, we build on this insight and model the interaction of structural hole seekers with actors who maximize other utility functions, at various network structures. When structural hole seekers interact with actors who maximize degree and closure, the later outperform the former when we consider betweenness. We obtained mixed results when we measured local brokerage (ego network betweenness). We conclude the paper with a discussion on implications for theory and practice."
2019,"From Field Identity Formation to Fragmentation: Cycles of Identity Drift and Expansions The present study contributes to the emerging area of research on field identity formation and change. Our findings suggest that identity custodians such as the professional and industry associations are crucial to the process of field identity formation. They not only organize the field members but also establish linkages with related organizations to forge an optimally distinct identity. The current study also explores the dynamics of field identity fragmentation. Our findings suggest that entry of new members leads to strains in either the symbolic or instrumental aspects of field identity that eventually culminates in identity fragmentation. The study further explicates the intermediary processes of identity drift and expansion. The identity drift in current case took place as new members with symbolic characteristics differing from existing members entered the field. This resulted in formation of cliques around the symbolic dimension and eventual fragmentation of field identity. The subsequent two identity fragmentations were brought about by identity expansion. In one case, the new field members felt the need of distinct identity as the expanded identity had become unmanageable. In another case, the old members felt the need for a separate identity as the expansion led to their under representation."
2019,"Cross Field Linkages and Agency in Organizational Fields Despite the recognition that society is composed by a web of interconnected fields, much of the research has focussed on the fields internal dynamics treated as silos, while the effect of cross-field linkages remains under-explored both theoretically and empirically. By drawing on the sociological literature on agency, we develop an analytical model of the stages through which cross-field linkages may affect agency within fields. The model focuses on four dimensions: a) conceptualizing the fields structure as a set of positioning that orient actor responses to cross-field linkages; b) understanding how generative mechanisms of agency act differentially on actors; c) broadening the scope of agency beyond purposeful action by the challenger and taking into account variation in temporal orientation; d) conceptualizing the critical role of resources in connecting agency with action. We illustrate our model through a contrastive case study of two universities in South Africa during the breakdown of the Apart-heid regime. Our analysis provides a differentiated understanding of variation in responses by the incumbent and challenger and demonstrates how asymmetry in resources largely explained why a disruptive external jolt led to gradual change within the field. Our model therefore moves beyond a representation of linkages as isolated incidents exploited by challengers to a more nuanced conception where linkages are embedded within the fields structure and may generate at times and between actors different responses turning stability and change depending on the specific contingencies."
2019,"Field-Configuring Projects? How Projects Shape the Framing of Electric Mobility in Germany Organizing in the context of projects has been investigated extensively on the project and organizational levels, yet the field-configuring potential of this organizational form is still poorly understood. We analyze two projects in relation to electric mobility (EMO) in Germany and study how the narratives and frames connected with these projects are related to the reception of electric mobility in the field-level public debate. To investigate the potential of these projects to configure organizational fields, we have applied a longitudinal mixed-methods approach by combining interpretative qualitative methods with big data research strategies. The results highlight how projects configure fields by opening and closing public debates and frames. In a broader sense, this study contributes to a more complete understanding of the relation between projects and events based on three scenarios: project-by-itself, project-follows-event and event-follows-project."
2019,"Cruising past the Scrutiny. Toward a General Theory of Social Exchanges in Issue Settlements This study examines the heated debate surrounding the cruise ships, grandi navi, in Venice, Italy. Drawing upon multiple data sources, we trace how the social exchanges among different field actors are able to neutralize the threat to the status quo and alter the natural course of the issue settlement that actors public framing would predict. Specifically, we show how the cruise industry indirectly targets regulators with the provision of resources and these actions decouple regulators public framing from their private decision to settle a contested issue. This work contributes to the literature on issue fields and issue settlements by providing a general theory of issue settlements that includes social exchanges. We advance propositions on the conditions in which social exchanges are likely to occur and on identify potential targets for exchanges from their statements in the public discourse."
2019,"Cognition and the Regulation of Attention by Incumbent Banks during the Emergence of FinTech Attention has been highly influential construct identifying the cognitive aspects of organizations and subsequent strategic moves. As the literature on attention developed to account for dimensions of attention that distinguish heterogeneity in adaptive outcomes, an opportunity to further elaborate on specifying the antecedents of attention itself emerges, particularly with respect to the competing issues that may detract from or the experiences and structures that promote attention toward new technologies. As such, this study leverages on an Attention-Based View (Ocasio, 1997) to focus more specifically on the predictors of organizational attention and the factors regulate attention inside the organization. The novel setting of financial technologys (FinTech) emergence in the global banking sector provides a context whereby attention to FinTech emerges heterogeneously among organizations based on a set of antecedents that are socially-oriented and situated within the governance channels of the organization, shedding light on how issues within dynamic environments are noticed by organizations before they are acted upon."
2019,"Augmented Empathy: Comprehending Other Minds in a Digitized World People seek to comprehend the reasoning of others. However, the human mind is complex and difficult to observe. Hence, this type of intersubjective problem solvingperceiving and comprehending another persons reasoning, termed cognitive empathizing in psychologycan stretch agents to the limits of their capabilities. People therefore simplify and approximate in resolving such problems. In this respect, people cognitively empathice about other minds, as a species of satisficing. Although digitized techniquesincluding artificial intelligence, affective computing and communication networkssignificantly augment cognitive empathicing. Digitization allows people to learn more and more about the reasoning of others. Yet new challenges thus arise, for digitally augmented capabilities can result in overly farsighted processes, and in particular, overly farsighted sampling and search of other minds, the opposite of nearsighted myopia. Augmented cognitive empathicing can therefore lead to overly complex representation and resolution of other minds, including their patterns of reasoning. Furthermore, when excessive farsightedness combines with persistent myopias, there are increasing risks of empathic divergence. People are more likely to miscomprehend others, viewing them as unreasoned, deviant or irrational. My paper examines these mechanisms of augmented cognitive empathicing and the consequences for interpersonal comprehension, cooperation and collectivity in a digitized world."
2019,"(Honesty-)Humility and the ABI-Model of Trust  a Theoretical Integration Building on the integrative model of trust and the HEXACO personality model, this paper aims to provide a theoretical framework that integrates trust with humility focused personality research. For interpersonal trust personality has been conceptualized and empirically researched on the side of the trustor, but there is almost a complete lack of research and especially of an overarching conceptual framework looking at the trustee. Building on a trait-behavior model we argue for an observer-based mechanism: Trustees humility leads to expressed humility and thereby humble behavior, which is perceived as trustworthy, increasing the likelihood for trust. We provide evidence that there is not only a trustworthiness trait but a personality factor: the Honesty-Humility dimension of the HEXACO framework. Focusing on perceived trustworthiness, we argue that the HEXACO model has several advantages over the Five-Factor model of personality. We show how each of the trustworthiness facets of the integrative model of trust can be incorporated within the Honesty-Humility personality domain. We provide an integrative trait-behavior paradigm as a theoretical extension of the integrative model of trust on the trustees side incorporating humility research."
2019,"The Tiny Acts of Management: Microfoundations of the (21st Century) Manager The practical question of what managers do in organizations had been considered largely settled by such scholars as Hales (1986) and Mintzberg (1994). Yet as we continue to automate an increasing number of capabilities once thought to be purely human in character, the literature falls perilously behind in theorizing the manager/managing constructs. In this essay we address what a manager is and what a manager isnt. Increasingly, new organizational forms move away from using bosses, and automate all the work; but we argue that managing is indispensable in a socially constructed organizational reality. We clarify that the manager is the essential social actor for creating value in an inter-objective (weakly socially constructed) organizational reality, whereas bosses capture value in inter-subjective organizational power relationships, and programs enforce fully rational organizational work. Furthermore, as scholars call for multilevel models and studies, we help to close this gap by offering a general, albeit not comprehensive, multilevel model of managerial action. While popular typologies of managerial action already exist for the firm level and practical level, we introduce a new typology of metacognitive managerial action. We sort adapt metacognition literature into four action types (problematizing, objectivizing, situating, committing), and suggest at least eight tiny acts. These intentional metacognitive acts are unique to human normative judgment in organizational contexts and so cannot be substituted by programmatic if/then learning algorithms. We encourage future work to expand and update these action typologies to flesh out the behavioral differences among specific managerial roles, personalities, and situations."
2019,"On Discursive Reconciliation of Sustainability Logics In this study, we investigate how managers in the energy and power industry in Northern Europe navigate potentially competing narratives of sustainability challenges. Through a qualitative study of an ongoing hydropower energy debate we explore the dynamics of how managers resolve and live with the apparent contradictions and tensions in social and profit goals. First we adopt a discursive perspective and identify six discursive processes of managers recognition of sustainability challenges through which managers resolve potentially conflicting goals. To further examine the fine-grained work through which the managers navigate competing narratives, we explore cognitive characterization of the produced discourses and find that conjunctive reasoning, disjunctive reasoning, counterfactuals and conditional reasoning characterizes discourses resolving demands of social and profit logics. We therefore extend existing research into the micro foundations of corporate responses to social issues and by doing so add to our understanding of the underlying variations in the way organizations respond to conflicting goals within an institutionally complex field."
2019,"A Framework of Dialectical Meaning Making in Emerging Technological Fields The paper advances a theoretical framework expounding the process of dialectical meaning creation in technology-driven emerging field. New technologies give rise to economic opportunities, social challenges, and futuristic imageries that spur debate among the actors primarily affected by them. The paper investigates how these discursive processes give rise to emerging organizational fields. The framework proposed here is articulated by first disentangling coordination, legitimation, and competition as core drivers of meaning making activity, and then by identifying technological artifacts, actors identities, and fields infrastructures as the main discursive issues subject to that meaning making activity. The theorization advanced in the paper serves to shed light on the different aspect that are subject to dialectical meaning creation in emerging fields, and it further contributes to a comprehensive understanding of how technological innovation get ingrained in the institutional landscape though the emergence of fields where designs, identities, and arrangements are negotiated among actors motivated by diverging interests and worldviews."
2019,"Everything Must Change so That Everything Can Stay the Same: Open Access in UK Academic Publishing. In this paper, I explore the question of how incumbents can effectively address threats to undermine their privileged positions and interests, when they are not in a position to oppose a reconfiguration of current institutional arrangements. I draw on the case of the transition towards Open Access in the field of academic publishing in the UK. The findings of this study reveal that in spite of the change - from academic production and distribution as closed access to Open Access - incumbents respond to the threat of disruption by using symbolic action. Thus, incumbents seek to convey subjective social meanings beyond its intrinsic content or obvious functional use - as a means of creating legitimacy in order to keep the resources that allow them to capture value. My findings contribute to current theories on institutional processes by refining the notion of institutional change, unpacking how incumbents act as institutional entrepreneurs by strategically adopting some elements of the institutional change that fit with arrangements favourable to their subject positions."
2019,"When Alt Right Enters Our Living Room: Contesting and Shifting Fields at a Field-Configuring Event This paper investigates how a field-configuring event is transformed from configuring an exchange field to configuring an issue field through mediatization. It is based on an extensive longitudinal study of the Gothenburg Book Fair between the Spring 2016 and the Spring 2018, including both a traditional field study with interviews and observations and an extensive analysis of traditional and social media coverage (twitter). The Fair, which is the biggest cultural event in the Nordic countries, got highly and publicly criticized for admitting an extreme-right wing newspaper publisher to exhibit in 2016. The debate developed on traditional and social media over more than 15 months between 2016 and 2017 and in the middle of the media storm, the Book Fair became the key event in 2016 and 2017 to discuss questions about freedom of expression and their limits in todays democratic societies. The study shows how mediatization played a crucial role in transforming the Book Fair as a field-configuring event from an exchange to an issue field by decentering agency, extending the event temporally and redefining its focus."
2019,"Board Diversity: How Board Values and Discretion Impact The Appointment of Female Directors Board diversity brings a variety of organizational benefits. As such, scholars have examined organizational, individual, and behavioral drivers of female board representation. However, little attention has been paid to the influence of board values on the decision to appointment a female to the board. In response, we focus on the political ideology of the board in terms of political conservatism vs. liberalism as an indicator of board values. We hypothesize that more liberal- leaning boards will be more likely to appoint a female given their openness to change and advocacy for equality in contrast to conservatives who tend to resist social change and prefer tradition and stability and are more accepting of inequality. To further support our theorizing, we examine the moderating contexts that may influence a boards discretion to have selection decisions reflect their political ideology. Using data from S&P; 1500 firms, we find support for our theorizing while addressing the potential for sample-induced endogeneity and the inclusion of previously studied drivers of female representation. We aim to spur further research at the nexus of board diversity and political ideology."
2019,"Institutional Investor Influence on Executive-to-Worker Pay Dispersion after the Financial Crisis In this study, we revisit the influence of institutional investors on executive-to-worker pay dispersion by replicating and extending Connelly, Haynes, Tihanyi, Gamache, and Devers (2016). Using a sample of S&P; 1500 firms in the period of 1996-2006, the original study reports that transient institutional investors positively affect executive-to-worker pay dispersion, while dedicated institutional investors negatively affect executive-to-worker pay dispersion. Our replication considers whether these relationships remain consistent over time and whether quasi-indexers, which make up the largest group of institutional investors yet are ignored in the original study, play a role in shaping executive-to-worker pay dispersion. Whereas we are able to reproduce Connelly et al.s (2016) findings for the period they focus on, our results show that the impact of transient institutional investors on executive-to-worker pay dispersion turns negative during 2007-2017. We also find that quasi-indexers function as a key force in reducing executive-to-worker pay dispersion during 2007-2017, though their impact is insignificant before this period. Our findings highlight the importance of temporal context as a boundary condition in understanding institutional investor influence over executive-to-worker pay dispersion. Moreover, we demonstrate that quasi-indexers influence over corporate governance outcomes should not be overlooked."
2019,"CEO Political Ideology and Corporate Discrimination Lawsuits: Examining the CEO-Board Interface Studies show that CEOs with different political ideologies differ in their values concerning equality and diversity issues. Extending this line of research, we argue that as conservative CEOs embed less egalitarian values to corporate-leadership compared to their liberal counterparts, their firms are more likely to experience a diversity-litigation-crisis  defined as the number of corporate-discrimination lawsuits filed against the organization. We also suggest that the hypothesized relationship between CEO conservativism and corporate-discrimination lawsuits attenuates when the board of directors is liberal-leaning. Data from the S&P; 500 firms support our predictions. Overall, our research reveals that, in an era where organizations strive to realize value from diversity, the CEO-Board ideology interface plays a key role in affecting corporate social outcomes."
2019,"The Impact of Formal and Informal Institutions on Gender Quotas in European Corporate Boards We assess whether and when regulatory quotas are effective in achieving gender equality on corporate boards in ten European countries. Specifically, we examine the joint effect of formal (quota design) and informal (firm social consciousness and national gender equality) institutions and find that firms exhibiting high levels of social consciousness in countries with legally-mandated versus self-regulated quota designs and high gender equality demonstrate the greatest progress toward more women on boards. By highlighting the role of self-regulation, organizational agency and alignment of formal and informal institutions, we contribute to institutional theory, public policy and corporate governance literatures."
2019,"The Role of Knowledge Specialists in Multiple-Goal Pursuit: A Field Experiment What enables organizations to pursue multiple goals simultaneously? Scholars agree that structural separation, such that different work units specialize in tasks related to only one goal at a time, is integral to answering this question. However, in some cases the same task affects multiple goals simultaneously such that specializing in tasks related to only one goal is impossible or undesirable. For such cases, I explored whether an organization structure that provides access to knowledge specialists each of whom focuses on only one goal can improve work unit performance. To do this, I conducted a field experiment across 25 locations of a social enterprise in India, where I randomly assigned different types of knowledge specialists to 101 work units. The key manipulation in this experiment was the job design of work-unit members where tasks related to generation and evaluation of ideas for performance improvement were divided based on the type of knowledge held by the worker. The results of this field experiment along with extensive qualitative work after the experiment show that specialists can indeed be useful in increasing work unit performance but that their effectiveness partly depends on the nature of goals."
2019,"Divide and Conquer  When and Why Exploration and Exploitation Should be Separated There is a consensus that achieving a balance between exploration and exploitation spurs superior performance, yet little agreement on how such balance should be achieved. In this paper we investigate the contingencies under which a separation design for balancing exploration and exploitation is superior to a non-separation design. Using a multi-armed bandit model, we demonstrate that a separation design outperforms a non-separation design in turbulent and noisy environments, yet underperforms otherwise. This is because a separation design ensures both completely value-sensitive exploitation and completely value-insensitive exploration, a combination that is important when past knowledge may not be good indicators for future exploration due to turbulence and noise, but wasteful in a stable and certain environment. We also offer different predictions from prior work by showing that the separation design effectively addresses the chasing a moving target problem."
2019,"Is Formalization Really Bad for Exploration? A Social Capital View of The Productivity Dilemma Researchers have argued that the formalization of activities improves organizational efficiency and reliability. Formalization, however, can drive rigidity and inertia, which inhibits exploration and innovation in the long run. While scholars have explored cognitive and routines to cope with this dilemma, a socially embedded perspective has been overlooked. Exploration is, however, a uniquely social process, which requires collaboration between individuals. In this paper, we propose that formalization can improve a teams social capital, and thereby facilitate the activities that enable exploration. Specifically, we hypothesize that formalization improves external communication, psychological safety, and the perception of support for innovation of operational teams, and these social capital attributes mediate the relationship between formalization and exploration. Hypotheses were tested with a mediation model, included 432 members of 62 operational teams in a multinational mining company that recently implemented a Process Management Program. Our results confirmed that formalization improved operational performance via enhanced exploration, and this latter effect was mediated by the teams social capital. The productivity dilemma can, therefore, be balanced by improving the social capital of operational teams."
2019,"The Role of Legitimacy Obtaining in Connecting Subsidiarys Contextual and Behavioral Ambidexterity This study analyzes the mechanisms that connect a subsidiary contextual ambidexterity with its behavioral ambidexterity within dual (external and internal) embeddedness. We argue two views: the alignment trading-up view and balancing trade-off view in managing subsidiary ambidexterity. We design a pair-wise survey of Taiwanese MNEs and their Chinese subsidiaries in different regions to test the hypotheses. The results show that: (1) an alignment condition of both high external and high internal cultural embeddedness will offer most resources in its dual cultural legitimacy obtaining process, which in turn makes the subsidiary to perform exploitation and exploration simultaneously; (2) a balancing condition of high internal and low external cognitive embeddedness can solve the resource and conformity dilemma in its dual cognitive legitimacy obtaining process, which in turn makes the subsidiary emphasize more on exploration and less on exploitation. The different effects of subsidiary legitimacy obtaining in contextual ambidexterity can examine subsidiarys behavioral ambidexterity strategy to adapt to the complex sources of dual embeddedness."
2019,"Doubling Down in Hollywood: Escalation of Commitment in the Product Launch Stage Limitations of the escalation of commitment literature include (1) examining hypothetical, typically unfinished projects, (2) using a limited set of predictor variables, and most importantly (3) ignoring whether the factors that drive escalation or the escalation behavior itself can turn failing projects into successes. We address these shortcomings by focusing on product development projects where escalation opportunities emerge in the product launch stage rather than the development stage. Using data from over 1100 Hollywood films, we identify 467 films that can be deemed as failing, and then examine the role that project, structural, social, and psychological determinants exert on escalation (expenditures made after the film opens poorly at the box office). We then examine whether escalation and these determinants lead to better final box office numbers. Our results question the common assumption that escalation is always a bad strategy, and we identify conditions under which escalation may be most prudent."
2019,"Complexity, Cognition, and the Search for a New Strategy Qualitatively studying the full transcripts of the Federal Reserves monetary policy committee during three meetings in the midst of a financial crisis, this paper traces individual committee members strategic search for a new strategy in a complex environment. Decision makers come in three varieties. Focused decision makers mostly ignore the interdependent nature of the complex environment. Interdependent decision makers attend moderate levels of complexity, opting for a strategy that balances internal coherence and practical feasibility. Finally, complex decision makers seek to internalize all environmental interdependencies even if it means proposing changes that are too radical for the decision making group to accept. It is found that over time attended complexity either stays fairly stable or then increases giving rise to six more fine-grained search strategies. This paper argues that cognitive path dependency, problem framing and reasoning with the help of a cognitive fixed point provide the key to understanding why some decision makers are able to expand their search domains. Furthermore, the paper proposes that in real world strategic situations search can be characterized as being either purposefully ad-hoc or concerned with systematic strategies."
2019,"Aspirations versus Expectations: Performance Feedback, Analyst Forecasts, and Corporate Downsizing We compare two competing models of corporate performance evaluation and examine their relative impact on strategic decisionsan organization-centered model based on performance feedback from historical and social comparisons, and an alternative, market-centered model based on the role of external market critics. We argue that, due to the prevailing norms of accountability and transparency, firms are more likely to make risky strategic changes based on how their performance is evaluated by external market critics, rather than by comparing their current performance to their own past performance or that of industry peers. We test our argument using the case of downsizing announcements made by major U.S. firms. Our analysis shows not only that the likelihood of downsizing announcements increases rapidly when firms performance drops below analyst forecasts, but also that the effect of performance relative to analyst forecasts dominates over the effect of performance relative to both historical and social aspiration levels. Our theory and findings provide a novel mechanism of the external, financial-market control of the firm in the contemporary capital market through the growing role of external market actors in the evaluation of firm performance and strategic decision making and implementation."
2019,"Humans and Algorithms in Organizational Decision Making: Evidence from a Field Experiment This paper reports the results of a controlled field experiment designed to investigate the interaction effects between humans and algorithms in organizational decision-making. We study the performance consequences of providing groups of managers making unstructured sales calls with alternative versions of an algorithm-based sales support system. Surprisingly, we find that standardized algorithms - which are clearly superior in terms of functionality and information processing when compared to the control groups basic information system - showed a negative overall treatment effect on managers sales performance. In comparison, an algorithm adapted to sales managers cognitive styles, showed a positive treatment effect. We further explore the role of human experience and find additional evidence for a human-algorithm interaction effect. Collectively, our results suggest intriguing complementarities in human and machines information processing when dealing with complex organizational decision-making."
2019,"Working the Net: Creating Momentum for Sustainability Through a Common Narrative Sustainable development that supports growth and consumption in a manner that ensures the availability of natural resources and humane living conditions for all amounts to a grand challenge that requires complex coordination among diverse actors. While existing research provides explanations why such collaborations are likely to fail, there are fewer explanations when and why some still succeed. Based on a comparative case study, we argue that a crucial element lies in the ability of actors to work their external network as they sell sustainability internally and coordinate complex issues within multi-stakeholder networks, where they need to bridge different temporal regimes between different stakeholders. We spell out the specific nature of the challenge of advocating environmental and social sustainability in the business context, as goals that are distant in time and space. Taking the perspective of those pursuing such complex interorganizational collaboration, we find that actors connect through a common narrative both internally and externally. As they encounter different temporal regimes among their partners, they engage in temporal brokering: they translate long-term goals into more proximal objectives for those that follow a more short term logic, and create financial and temporal buffers for smaller players."
2019,"How Idea Sellers Facilitate Buying Dynamics to Build Collective Commitment to New Ideas Using real time process data on two cross-occupational and inter-organizational problem solving groups that shaped inter-organizational treatment processes in the Finnish health care field, this study explores how individuals selling new ideas create collective commitment to their ideas. Comparing matched pairs of successful and unsuccessful ideas, we show how individuals selling ideas for groups of idea buyers making selection decisions facilitate what we call buying dynamics to influence the psychological bonds that idea buyers form with the ideas. We integrate our findings into a process model of buying dynamics explaining how idea sellers can successfully make idea buyers take responsibility for idea implementation. This paper has theoretical implications for our understanding of idea selection in pluralistic organizations, idea championing, and collective problem solving."
2019,"Empowering Climate Leaders: An Open Resourcing Approach to Issue Selling Midlevel employees proactively contribute to organizational change by drawing attention to emerging strategic issues, but these efforts often founder due to a lack of organizational backing. However, little attention has been paid to organizational efforts to promote issue selling or to external connections that support these efforts. We contribute to filling these gaps by investigating the impacts on issue selling of an inter-organizational network that promotes climate change reforms at participating organizations. We develop resourcing and open polity theories to understand how external resource flows can sustain issue sellers and expand reform ambitions, contingent on organizational preparations for change. Our analysis combines longitudinal surveys, interviews, and archival records from the Environmental Defense Fund Climate Corps program to reveal the critical role of external and organizational support for issue sellers. The results advance research on issue selling, organizational change, and resourcing, as well as contribute to the urgent problem of understanding climate change mitigation."
2019,"Game Mechanics in the Virtual Environment: Revenue Recognition of Virtual Goods This paper studies the practice of recognizing revenue from the sale of virtual goods. By virtual goods we mean digital objects, such as avatar features or skill boosts, which are usable only in the game environment in which they are sold. Like tangible goods, virtual goods may be consumed at a point in time or overtime. As such, the sale of virtual goods requires a consideration of the recognition and measurement of revenue. We conduct a qualitative case study of two major game companies of the practice of recognizing revenue from the sale of virtual goods. We consider the application of game-level design and processes in the virtual environment to business-level processes of accounting for revenue in the real environment. The study contributes to the growing literature on the translation of accounting regulations into practice, and on the infrastructures and networks of expertise that support financial reporting."
2019,"Family, State, and Quasi-Market: Institutional Logics and the Adoption of Old-Age Insurance Practice This study examines the adoption of new contract-based old-age insurance practices among privately owned enterprises in China during 20002008. We compare the effects of competing logics in the welfare domainthe traditional Confucian family logic based on intergenerational social obligation specified in Confucian filial piety, the socialist state logic associated with lifetime employment in state-owned enterprises, and the socialist market logic featuring state-mandated contractual responsibilities of employers toward employeeson firm owners adoption behavior. We find that firm owners from an extended family background are less likely to adopt the new social welfare practice, while owners with prior work experience with a state-owned enterprise and owners situated in a region with more professionals such as lawyers and accountants are more likely to adopt the new practice. The effects of these three factorsrepresenting the three logics, respectivelyweaken each other. However, in regions with a stronger socialist market logic, the influence of the extended family logic fades away to a greater extent than the influence of the socialist state logic. We discuss the implication of these findings for research in institutional logics."
2019,"Internal Logics of Control: A Study of the Relationship between Internal and External CSR in China We investigate the relationship between internal and external corporate social responsibilities (CSR)voluntary provision of employee insurance and corporate charitable contributionthat benefit internal and external stakeholders respectively. We argue that internal logics of control affect the extent to which the two different forms of CSR are either complementary or substitutive. Internal logics of control are owners formal and informal rules of action, interaction, and interpretation that shape organizational behaviors and reflect the institutional orders in which the owners are embedded. Specifically, we examine how a stronger state logic of control makes the two forms of CSR more substitutive because of an inconsistent focus on employees and the broader society in this logic, and resource constraints. By contrast, a greater market logic of control introduces a consistent and comprehensive focus on both employees and the broader society, is associated with fewer resource constraints and more concern with reputational risk, making the two forms of CSR more complementary. Furthermore, environmental munificence weakens the effect of the state logic of control while it strengthens that of the market logic of control. We found empirical support for our hypotheses by investigating a unique longitudinal dataset of Chinese private ventures from 1993-2012. Our study contributes to research on institutional logics by highlighting owners as carriers of institutions and integrating capital resource dependence as an important intra-organizational mechanism of logic transmission, and provides a more comprehensive understanding of the interrelationship between different types of CSR."
2019,"Museums, Money, and Markets: Crisis and Attention-based Imitation in US Art Museums 2007-2011 This paper analyzes the impact of one type of exogenous shock, the US economic crisis in 2008, on organizational imitation, specifically the adoption of market practices in American art museums. It explains how economic crisis reshaped the imitative strategies of decision makers facing external challenges. Using data from the population of American art museums (a sample of 501(c)(3) operating charities of NTEE (The National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities) code A51 art museums), we demonstrate that market practice adoption of the nonprofit organizations was accelerated by the economic crisis not only because it directly undermined the resource base of art museums but also because it reshaped how decision makers tried to resolve external challenges. Revisiting the institutional logics and organizational attention perspectives for organizations under extreme uncertainty, this study theorizes how exogenous shock delimits organizational cognition and alters problem-solving search behavior, thus accelerating heuristic inter-organizational imitation. With empirical evidence of US art museums under economic crisis, we show that a shock can temporarily upset resource environment and change of organizations reference group to seek for solutions through Attention-based imitation: from leader to peer organizations, from physically distant to close organizations, and from non-direct connection to direct connection."
2019,"Attending Conflicting Logics when Doing Good: The Role of External Fit for CSR Activities Outcomes Organizations increasingly face the challenge to abide to multiple and often conflicting logics in many of their activities, as they aim to cater to multiple stakeholders. Yet, the extent to which the interplay between such logics affects their performance is still poorly understood. We investigate this issue in the context of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities, a domain where such conflict routinely plays out. Engaging in CSR activities consistent with a community logic is a strategic issue for most organizations, which can positively influence their financial performance. Yet, doing so also proves challenging for managers, as some stakeholders see such activities as clashing with a focus on efficiency and profit maximization that is intrinsic to a market logic. We believe this relationship is moderated by the type of CSR activities companies engage in. More specifically, we theorize that the degree to which CSR activities exhibit external business fit  i.e., are closer to the industry-specific market logic (or the set of activities linked to increased efficiency and profitability in the focal firms industry)  will positively moderate the link between CSR activities and financial performance. Furthermore, the degree to which CSR activities exhibit external CSR fit  i.e., are more in line with the industry-specific community logic (or the type of CSR activities other companies in the industry typically engage in to benefit the communities in which the focal firm is active)  will negatively moderate the relationship between CSR activities and financial performance. In other words, we argue that organizations need to strike a balance between conforming to and differentiating from the industry with regards to their CSR activities. Using a dataset comprising the S&P; 100 companies from 2002 to 2015 we find support for our hypotheses. In addition to introducing two distinct concepts of external fit, we contribute to the literature on institutional logics by suggesting how managers dealing with conflicting logics might turn what is perceived as a dualism into a duality, thus benefitting from their simultaneous adherence to multiple logics and achieving optimal distinctiveness."
2019,"Organizing a Competitive Logic in the Swedish School Market A common assumption in organizational literature is that the rules by which organizations compete in a market emerge from processes of mutual adjustment among competitors to the constraints posed by market structures and institutions. While this may often be the case, we point the analytical gaze to the arguably prevalent but understudied case where the rules for competing are decided, i.e. result from an attempt at organizing by an organizer, rather than by mutual adjustment among competitors. We explore the formation and change of a competitive logic among Swedish upper secondary schools, using archival and interview data from two municipalities. We find how a broad-sweeping reform initially failed to shape a competitive logic, i.e. schools did not think they were competing. Over time, however, the idea of competing for students took hold, resulting in the organization of two very different competitive logics. Our findings speak to literatures that deal with institutional, geographical, and structural perspectives on competition, adding the notion of organizers as central actors in processes where competition forms and changes."
2019,"Time Will Tell: Sequencing Institutional Logics to Aid Business Recovery after Natural Disasters Existing research suggests a paradox regarding the effects of government sponsorship of local business recovery during natural disasters, where the largest provider of public resources has been associated with the poorest outcomes. To lend insight into this contradiction we develop a model of how the temporal sequencing of public and private relief organizations influence resource allocation and distribution mechanisms with different performance consequences for business recovery. We use interview, archival, and survey data on financial assistance to local market-based businesses in the context of Hurricane Ike in Galveston, Texas in 2008. Data analysis suggests that public and private relief organizations adhere to different institutional logics. Successful business recovery relies on the correct temporal sequencing of relief organizations with public (state logic) and private (community logic) resources. Whereas relief organizations operating under the state logic can more effectively guarantee resources, relief organizations operating under the community logic can more efficiently allocate and distribute resources. This model identifies a new concept, logic sequencing, and opens new research on the temporal sequencing of institutional logics under extreme events and societal grand challenges. It further suggests managerial and urban planning policy innovations regarding public-private partnerships for the market performance of business organizations in the aftermath of natural disasters."
2019,"Poison or Tonic: A Relational View of Institutional Logics Tensions and conflicts between coexisting, yet contradicting logics have moved to the center stage of institutional logics research: institutional complexity is now understood as a potential threat and opportunity, and as for empirical contexts, more likely to be the norm rather than the exception. We take the concept of institutional complexity to a next level, demonstrating that not only does it occur between logics but that every logic is necessarily inconsistent and internally institutionally complex. We propose a relational view, maintaining that each logic gains meaning and impact as a governing force from its contrast and opposition to another logic. Compliance with an institutional logic thus requires maintaining a balance between a logics dominant meaning and its supplementelements from a contradicting logic which are incorporated into the focal logic anddepending on the dosestrengthen or undermine it. Drawing from two cases of artistic interventions into businesses, we illustrate how our relational view can explain aspects of inter- and intra-logic dynamics that otherwise would remain anomalies. We conclude by highlighting its implications for logics viewed as structures and processes, and the role and reach of agency."
2019,"When Doing Right and Bad Combine: How Pluralist Organizations Comply with Configurations of Logics Research on institutional complexity has focused on how pluralist organizations comply with a small number of independent institutional logics. Little attention has been paid to the interactions between more than two logics. Through a configurational analysis of 115 elite business schools, which experience a range of interdependent institutional logics and heavy scrutiny from stakeholders, I make three contributions. I contribute to the literature on institutional complexity by showing how organisations comply with configurations of multiple interdependent, rather than independent logics. Equally, I contribute to the literature on the outcomes of institutional complexity by showing that, given the interaction effects between logics, stakeholders evaluate compliance with multiple interacting institutional logics more holistically than previously assumed. I show that this produces more gradual, non-binary outcomes than the failure or success of organizational pluralism portrayed in the literature. Finally, rather than the stylised clashes between two institutional logics in fields, I show that the interaction of multiple non-dominant and dominant institutional logics can change fields more gradually than commonly shown in the literature. Based on this, I argue that my results provide for a more realistic conceptualisation of the mechanisms and effects of institutional pluralism. I conclude that, given interaction effects between configurations of logics, pluralist organizations need to carefully consider what institutional logics they comply with, given the unexpected outcomes that compliance can produce."
2019,"Trading Human and Social Capital: Should it be about How the Shoe Fits? I explore how hiring decision-making can be enhanced by jointly considering two significant dimensions of employee-employer matching: Human Capital Fit and Social Capital Fit. I define Human Capital Fit as the extent to which an individuals human capital matches with an organizations human capital structure, and Social Capital Fit as the extent to which an individuals social capital matches with an organizations social capital structure. I argue that different combinations of fit imply different alternatives that would either maintain or modify the scope and depth of organizational resources, eventually influencing organizational processes and outcomes. Thus, I build a conceptual framework that allows me to identify four different hiring strategies and theorize why organizations would pursue them. By taking a strategic perspective that considers both individual and relational assets relative to the organization, I extend prior theory on employee mobility and on the effects of new hires in organizations."
2019,"The Importance of Gender Congruence in Corporate Social Responsibility: Field Experimental Evidence Labor market scholars have made recent calls for moving beyond demand-side explanations for observed labor market outcomes and for uncovering supply-side processes. Some recent work in this vein suggests that job seeker preferences may lead certain subsets of job seekers to apply to some jobs over others. While it is plausible that job-seeker decisions and preferences are shaped by demand-side factors, we have a limited understanding of how these processes interact. In this study, we examine how easily observable characteristics of potential employersnamely gender composition and socially responsible claimscontribute to shaping the applicant pool. Specifically, since these firm characteristics coexist and social responsibility is perceived to be female-typed, we examine how these characteristics interact in influencing whether prospective employees apply for jobs. Addressing this research question poses a key empirical challenge: it is necessary to observe not only those who do apply to a job, but also the risk pool of those would could have applied. We address this challenge using a unique field experimental design and find that congruence between firm gender composition and social responsibility is a key predictor of whether prospective applicants apply for an otherwise identical job opportunity."
2019,"Internal Market for Executives: Inter-divisional Transfer and Resource Sharing The problem of resource allocation is a particularly pressing issue in large and highly diversified companies, where business divisions of different industry dynamics compete for limited resources. However, prior work has focused primarily on impersonal, often structural, mechanisms for resource coordination and control, paying scant attention to the actual process involving human agents such as executives who perform the role of coordination and control in strategic resource allocation decisions. To address this situation, we explore how the inter-divisional mobility of executives serves as a key mechanism to manage the corporate-wide sharing of both tangible and intangible resources. Using business groups in Korea from 1989 to 2006 as an empirical setting, we demonstrate that patterns of executive transfer among divisions clearly coincide with group-level resources and intra-group dependence relationship. Our results also show that such patterns are reshaped by the influence of external environments, i.e., product market competition and capital market control. This study highlights the unique importance of executives who carry the role of coordination and control in sharing resources within a firm, and thereby provides new insight for extant research that has viewed internal labor markets as sources of individual or firm-specific skills."
2019,"Don't Leave Me Now - Organizational Responses to Collective Employee Turnover While a vast body of literature provides important insights into how organizations may proactively seek to control collective turnover levels, few studies examine whether and how organizations might respond reactively to turnover when it deviates from expected levels. We integrate insights from the behavioral theory of the firm and human resource management literature to develop theory and test hypotheses about how collective turnover relative to aspirations may impact human capital investments including employee compensation, on-the-job training and off-site training investments. Results obtained from a unique panel dataset pertaining to 19 years of data from 1,920 Belgian firms are largely supportive of our theory. Turnover above aspirations positively influences compensation, yet negatively influences investments in off-site training. These results provide important contributions to research on collective turnover, human resource management and performance feedback."
2019,"Managing a Strategic Paradox across Organizational Boundaries Top managers are increasingly embedding paradoxes into the goals of the firms strategy to reinforce both/and thinking and manage competing demands simultaneously. The paradox literature offers important insights into how management can address strategic paradoxes effectively. However, given that paradoxes are persistent by definition, the paradox literature theorizes surprisingly little about how firms can deal with continuously emerging tensions from strategic paradoxes. In this paper, we draw on an in-depth case study to examine how a top management team manages a strategic paradox that opposes organizational efficiency and employee identity goals. The study reveals how the proliferating tensions emerging from a strategic paradox may be managed by incorporating opportunities that reach beyond organizational boundaries. We identify five managerial practices that enact mutually exclusive, mutually constraining, mutually enabling, and mutually reinforcing relationships among contradictory elements, and that taken together offer an integrative and dynamic model of the management of strategic paradox. The model extends the previous literature by incorporating practices that traverse organizational boundaries, and by integrating a diverse set of practices into a holistic explanatory framework."
2019,"The False Mastery of Paradox: The Case of Volkswagen Emissions Scandal In management and organization studies, the challenge of dealing with paradoxes has become a central issue. The literature, however, is largely populated by research inclined to idealize paradoxical framing in thinking and theorizing. In this paper, we explore the perils paradoxes present when generated by stretch goals the achievement of which is accomplished through organizational charade. The Volkswagen (VW) emissions scandal is a case that shows how paradoxical promises that are embraced discursively but not substantively create representational simulacra rather than paradoxical mastery. By studying VWs attempt to embrace paradoxes that proved to be a stretch too far, we explore how hubristic leadership, embedded in high-level cultural intolerance for failure, initiated VWs scandal."
2019,"The Spillover of Inter-Organizational Paradox Management Practices in Global Value Chains  This study discusses how and whether paradox management practices spill over between organizations along a global value chain. Based on case study evidence related to a global value chain from the footwear industry between Germany and China, we study how different actors (i.e. retailer, importer, manufacturers, material suppliers) coped with the paradoxical tensions between providing living wages to workers and upholding high financial performance. Our findings show: (a) the German national business system created an institutional context in which the living wage paradox was evaluated in a proactive manner, while the Chinese national business system favored a more defensive response to the paradox and (b) that Chinese organizations reframed a proposed paradox management practice (living wage audits) in a way that it lost its intended meaning. Based on these results, we develop a sensemaking model, which explains why the paradox management practice was reframed from a proactive into a defensive tool."
2019,"Encore! Maintaining Paradox and Balance with Social Drama Paradoxes are rife in organizations. As a response, scholars have started to build meta-theory, and it is this area to which this article contributes. Specifically, I focus on paradox maintenance and balance. Using qualitative data from fieldwork carried out in an experimental community, I first show how social performance - or drama based processes - can be used to maintain paradoxical environments. Second, the data reveal a new type of hybrid equilibrium, that moves the conversation on balance away from dynamic versus punctuated models. A third finding describes how a paradox is more conducive to maintenance when there are shared characteristics between a tension and the wider environment in which it is embedded. Overall, the article contributes to how we think of paradox maintenance and balance, as meta-theoretical concepts. With this in mind, the findings also have a strong implications for practice, especially for organizations that wish to exploit some of the benefits that paradoxical environments can potentially offer."
2019,"Not All Leisure is Shirking: CEO Endurance Leisure and Firm Value We join a conversation surrounding CEO shirking and develop theory challenging the literatures current assumption that CEO leisure can generally be considered costly an indicator of shirking that is detrimental to firm value. Specifically, we draw on theory and empirical research from the leisure studies domain suggesting that leisure activities yield varying levels of benefits for participants, and we theorize that whether engaging in leisure equals shirking depends on the leisure activities CEOs pursue. We introduce and focus on CEO endurance leisure and theorize that CEOs who engage in this type of leisure will experience physical and psychological benefits that will lead to greater CEO performance, and subsequently, greater firm value. We also theorize about a number of moderators. Consistent with these ideas, we find that CEO endurance leisureas assessed by marathon runningis positively associated with firm value, and we find that endurance leisure is most beneficial when CEOs are older or appear to be facing stressful conditions. We also find that CEO endurance leisure is associated with positive stock returns and mutual funds investment decisionstwo alternative measures of firm value."
2019,"Corporate Governance Innovation in the Digital Age Since the advent of the digital age, a number of notable innovations have been developed which are likely to affect corporate governance outcomes. These include the development of blockchain ledgers, e-voting, robo-advisors, and dark pools, among others. To make sense of these new developments, we propose a historically-informed model of corporate governance innovation connecting the producers, users, and key characteristics of these innovations to their effect on corporate governance outcomes relating to corporate control. We argue that the most salient characteristics of these innovations are how they affect investors participation in monitoring firms, in addition to their impact on the strength of investors relationships with firms. The effect of these characteristics is moderated by users and producers behaviors, resources, capabilities, and complementaritiesin other words, the extent to which actors can effectively deploy the innovations to achieve their corporate control objectives. Essentially, we argue that corporate governance innovations act as antecedents to corporate governance outcomes. By identifying the salient features of corporate governance innovations created in the past and observing their effect on corporate governance outcomes, we then apply the model to inform our understanding of the likely impact of recently-developed corporate governance innovations in the digital age."
2019,"Competitive Behaviour of Young Firms under Industry Deregulation Based on institutional and resource dependence theories, this paper investigates how board structures and board share ownership affect young firms competitive nonconformity behaviours. By using the 7,391 competitive actions of fifteen commercial banks, we establish that larger board size leads young firms to adopt competitive nonconformity strategies while more foreign board directors and higher share ownership of board directors discourage young firms to employ competitive nonconformity strategies. The proposed study provides a better understanding of young firms' competitive behaviours under industrial deregulation where the pressure for institutional conformity is normally largely reduced."
2019,"Boards of Directors as Complex Adaptive Systems This conceptual paper aims to contribute to a theoretical foundation for the next step in the research into the behavioral indicators that make a board of directors effective. To this end, we conceive of boards as complex adaptive systems. Boards as complex adaptive systems are characterized by their open and nested interactions, their in-between-ness and primarily by their display of emergence. Emergence in boards refer to the arising of novel and ostensive states, behavioral patterns and structures on the level of the board as a team, out of the individual interactions and processes within the board of directors. To enable research into these emergent board phenomena, an expandable model has been developed that identifies various elements of a board as a complex adaptive system. Future research should aim to identify the configurations of emerging phenomena that make a board more effective and, above all, how and when tipping points transform a board from a stable adverse configuration into a different beneficial configuration."
2019,"The Gendering of Money: How Gender Influences Matching in the Market for Entrepreneurial Finance There is a significant gender gap in the allocation of investment capital to entrepreneurs. While numerous studies have investigated how either demand-side, or supply-side explanations contribute to this phenomenon, they have failed to consider entrepreneurial financing as a two-sided matching process, in which investor and entrepreneurs evaluate each other as potential partners. This can be explained in part by the empirical challenge of working with data on realized matches. I take advantage of a unique dataset allowing me to observe both sides of the market, including failed as well as successful matches, in order to explore how individual gender preferences and biases combine to shape markets in a way that skews the distribution of resources between groups. In particular, I investigate the role played by homophily and gendered expectations of fit on both sides of the matching process, in contributing to gender segregation."
2019,"Early Imprint Formation: Episodes of Collective Bricolage in the Creation of the BBC Organizational imprinting denotes the process by which organizations adopt environmental characteristics that persist for a long time even when the environment changes (Johnson, 2007; Stinchcombe, 1965). Research on imprint formation hints at the collective nature of this process but still lacks an understanding of the processes by which multiple actors interact during early imprint formation. We address this gap through a study of the creation of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) in the 1920s where the BBC adopted a set of unique organizational characteristics that persist until today. We found that early imprint formation resulted from multiple episodes of collective bricolage. During each episode, the organization adopted characteristics that were continued, modified or abandoned at later stages. The final outcome of this multi-year process formed an imprint that has persisted for more than 90 years. We contribute to early imprint formation literature by proposing a process model of early imprint formation based on collective bricolage. We argue that key imprints formed in this process remain stable over long time periods. Moreover, we contribute to the literature on bricolage in organizations by proposing collective bricolage as a mechanism leading not only to innovation but also to persistence."
2019,"Understanding the Symbiotic Relationship between Venture Capitalists and New Ventures This study seeks to extend our understanding of how various conditions influence the trajectory of co-evolutionary relationships between two seemingly symbiotic populations. To that end, we trace the co-evolutionary path of medical tech start-ups and venture capitalist (VC) investors in the US from 1980 to 2017 and examine the impact of the tech-bubble, government supports, and industry maturity on their co-evolutionary relationship. We found support for the existence of a deviation-amplifying relationship between previous growth and current growth of new medical tech ventures and a deviation-countering relationship between previous exit events and growth in new medical tech ventures. However, contrary to expectations, we found a deviation-countering, or competitive, co-evolutionary relationship between growth in the number of new VC investors and growth in the number of new ventures instead of a symbiotic one. Our findings suggest that co-evolutionary relationships between two seemingly symbiotic populations may actually become deviation-countering in the presence of other stronger deviation countering reciprocal causal processes."
2019,"Fools Squeeze in Late? Founder Characteristics and the Weak Competitiveness of Late Entrants Does late entry cause weak competitiveness, or do inherently weak organizations enter mostly late? Received literature has predominantly argued for the prior. However, when asymmetries characterize entrepreneurs/organizations access to information, the latter is equally plausible, yet holds very different implications for theory and practice. Drawing on well-established streams of literature, I argue that entrepreneurs who lack relevant prior experience not only found weaker organizations on average, but are also slower at spotting opportunities, and thus tend to enter emerging industries relatively late. As a result, the higher-than-average failure rates among late entrants might be better explained by their inherently weak competitiveness rather than by their unfavorable time of entry. The proposed theory is tested on the full population of Greek stock brokerage companies, 1996-2005."
2019,"The Role of Temporal Dynamics in the Effects of Content Innovativeness on Diffusion Studies of diffusion have long drawn substantial interest from social movement scholars. With the rise in social media, scholars have become increasingly interested in how the nature of content on social media might be related to its dissemination across online social networks. In this paper, we examine how content differentiation affects the spread of a social movement. We argue that the various stages of a protest cycle moderate the relationship between the innovativeness of content related to a movement and the rate of diffusion of the movement. To test our propositions, we adopt methods from natural language processing to conduct a computational analysis of content related to the Black Lives Matter movement on Twitter from May 2016 to July 2016. Our findings show that tweets with less differentiated content are more likely to spread during the initial stage of a protest cycle  which we call the ripening stage  but when the movement gains momentum  entering what we call the frenzy stage  tweets with more differentiated content are more likely to spread."
2019,"The Network Dynamics of Conventions How does network structure shape the emergence of social and technological conventions? Social and organizational networks tend to have a small number of well-connected central nodes that are far more connected than the average individual. Previous research has shown that such centralized networks can be advantageous when speed is a priority, because central individuals can spread new practices and technologies and can coordinate the actions of the network as a whole. However, when multiple strategies compete for adoption, the fastest process may not select the optimal strategy. This paper presents theoretical results from a computational model of convention formation showing that centralization does increase speed of convergence, but also decreases the probability that the best strategy will become widely adopted. While these results may suggest a speed-optimality trade-off, an examination of network density shows that speed is not inherently problematic, as dense networks are both fast and optimal. The deleterious effects of network centralization are explained instead by the influence of central nodes. In centralized networks, the influence of central nodes allow their solutions to spread at the expense of less popular but higher payoff solutions."
2019,"Born in the US Raised in Denmark: Exploring the Cocreation of a Management Concept In this article we develop a process model of the cocreation of management concepts in the nexus of supply- and demand-side actors. In contrast to existing models that tend to focus on either the supply or the demand side, we employ a cocreation perspective to advance new understandings of how the boundaries between supply and demand side blur and dwindle during the translation and spread of a management concept. Using a longitudinal case study design, we followed how the American-born management concept Leadership Pipeline was reframed, boosted, and maintained in the Danish public sector through a series of supply- and demand-side interactions, including close collaborations between consultants, researchers and adopting organizations. Our model infers three distinct but interrelated cocreation activities that are crucial to the translation and spread of a management concept in the nexus of supply- and demand-side actors: (1) circumventing roles, (2) connecting spokespersons, and (3) leveraging mutually valued outcome. We illustrate the core actions underpinning each of these activities and end the article by outlining implications for research on the translation and spread of management concepts."
2019,"Network Structure and the Adoption of Technological Innovation We investigate how innovation adoption is affected by focal firms extent of exclusivity with their network partners  the extent to which focal firms work with their network partners whose portfolio of relationships was concentrated with the focal firms relative to their competitors. We argue that greater extent of exclusivity promotes innovation adoption by alleviating the problems of control and coordination, which are endemic to co-operative production networks. Further, we propose three boundary conditions that reduce the positive effects of extent of exclusivity on technology adoption  focal firms having greater experience with problems with prior technologies, larger number of network partners, and larger average number of projects with their partners. We test our predictions using data on the U.S. recording industry between 1995 and 2005. This study extends the literature on social networks by introducing a new network property that takes into account how the network of focal firms network partners plays an important role in the adoption of innovations by the focal firms."
2019,"The Role Values Play for Agency in Institutions Although values play an important role as normative ends that drive human agency in institutions, new institutionalism (NI) has paid limited attention to them. Consequently, NI tends to be driven by structural determinism and comes somewhat short when explaining agency in institutional structures. In order to better understand how values promote action in institutions, we conduct a literature review of 122 journal articles published between 1989 and 2016 that draw on NI to study the value-laden management concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR). We make three contributions. First, we show how considering values enhances our understanding of behavior in various institutional contexts at the micro-, meso and macro-level of analysis and reveals a more-balanced view on the structure-agency duality. Second, we map the NI/CSR field conceptually, indicating areas of current contributions and providing insight into recent developments. Finally, we present under-explored themes and directions for future research."
2019,"Busting Out of the Iron Cage: Network Mobilization and Responses to Professional Prescriptions Institutions are undergirded by ongoing sets of social relations. The relationships that give rise to and reinforce institutions can be examined through a network perspective, one approach to which is examining network structure. The structural approach underestimates the role of agency in both institutional and network processes. The research herein examines the relationship between institutional agency and network agency by asking how network mobilization enables forms of social capital associated with institutional agency. The study of 415 contacts of 52 school managers shows those who mobilize networks of trusted, expert and influential contacts conform less to professional prescriptions promulgated by normative pressures in the field. Managers who mobilize networks of contacts who are accessible and endowed with material resources conform more. These findings suggest the importance of continued research on the mutually constitutive relationship between network and institutional processes."
2019,"Cutting the Gordian Knot: A Microfoundational and Dynamic Based Typology of Institutional Actors Institutional theory has a Gordian knot to be solved. It lacks a theory of actorhood that defines actors as change agents who perceive institutional contradictions as opportunity for change while complying with institutional theorys key principal of actors embeddedness. To cut this knot, we develop a microfoundational and dynamic based theory of actorhood that is based on two actors main properties: skills and identity. As these properties are shaped by macro-conditions such as stable social fields or institutional contradictions and as they evolve over time, our theory of actorhood explains dissimilar behaviour of actors in similar situations. On this basis, we develop four types of institutional actors that behave differently during situations of institutional contradictions."
2019,"Institutional Change as a Discovery Process Through the Development of Awareness Our understanding of institutional change has evolved considerably in recent years, moving from an entrepreneurial and agentic view to a more unintentional view of change. What is however lacking is a better understanding of the process leading from one to the other. This paper suggests that the two possibilities are on a continuum, institutional change being unintentional first, then becoming intentional as actors awareness rises. In this article, relying on a longitudinal study of an Algerian experience, we develop a process model of institutional change intentionality by showing how institutional actors intentionality develops as part of everyday practices within an organization. We provide two main contributions to institutional theory. First, we show the emergence of institutional entrepreneurship from an intentionality point of view by showing how actors initially move from actions non-purposively targeting institutions to institutional work. Second, we identify a four stage-model of institutional entrepreneurship awareness. In doing so, we theorize how actors make sense of their daily organizational life and turn to deliberate institutional work."
2019,"Doing Well despite Doing Bad? Investor Response to Repeated Illegal Behavior This study examines how a firms history of repeated offending affects investor response to a new illegal act. Drawing on expectancy violations theory (EVT), we hypothesize that investor response to the announcement of a new illegal act is more negative for firms with a medium number of prior illegal acts than for firms with a small or a large number of prior illegal acts. Analyzing firms illegal acts in the U.S. utilities industry over a 28-year time horizon, we find evidence that a firms extent of repeated offending indeed influences investor response to a newly announced illegal act in a U-shaped manner. We further find that prior firm acquittals and industry pervasiveness of corporate illegality dampen the U-shaped relationship. Collectively, our study contributes to extant literatures on corporate illegality and organizational reputation by investigating the performance implications of repeated offending, by unraveling the theoretical mechanisms underlying investor response to repeated offending, and by providing novel evidence that not only good but also bad reputation can function as a buffer in case of a negative event."
2019,"Sweeping it under the Rug: Positioning Pollution-Intensive Activities in Organizational Hierarchies Often referred to as the pollution haven effect, researchers have shown that organizations locate their pollution-intensive activities in lenient regulatory jurisdictions. In this paper, we explore a similar phenomenon -- the location of pollution-intensive activities within the organizational hierarchy of the multilayered subsidiary form (MLSF), which is an organizational form that comprises a parent company with two or more levels of subsidiaries that are legally independent from the parent company. In this paper, we analyze the location of the pollution-intensive activities of the 71 largest US-headquartered chemical manufacturing firms, which comprise 23,201 business establishments. As expected, we find that firms assign pollution-intensive activities to subsidiaries that are hierarchically distant from the parent company, but we also find that firms are likely to do so even when they are subject to strong environmental regulations at home and host states. These findings suggest that firms capitalize on the multiple layers of liability firewalls between parents and subsidiaries in the MLSF to obfuscate the responsibility of parent companies for their subsidiaries ecological footprint. More importantly, stringent environmental regulations seem to push, rather than pull, pollution-intensive activities away from the parent, suggesting that organizations use the MLSF to sidestep stringent environmental regulations."
2019,"To Give and Give Not: Corporate Philanthropy, Government Aid, and Political Polarization In this study, we examine the distributional consequences of corporate philanthropy. We argue that the strategic nature of corporate philanthropy means that corporate donations will go disproportionately to the more economically influential sections of society who constitute key stakeholders for for-profit firms. Private provision to these influential communities will tend to crowd out government transfers however, with this reduction in government aid affecting even those communities that do not directly benefit from corporate philanthropy. As a result, corporate philanthropy will have a socio-politically polarizing effect. We test and find support for our arguments by examining corporate foundation giving in the US from 2003 to 2011. In particular, we show that increasing differences in corporate donations are associated with increasing political differences, as reflected in US presidential elections from 2004 to 2012. Our study thus suggests that corporate philanthropy may act as a regressive and polarizing force, and highlights the need to think more carefully about who corporate philanthropy benefits and how the gains from it are distributed."
2019,"Understanding Organizational Integrity from an Institutional Perspective Organizational integrity requires that organizations do not act in a purely opportunistic manner, but rather align decisions and actions to be consistent with their espoused social values and demonstrate value-attuned responsiveness to their external environment. Despite significant scholarly attention to employee and managerial integrity, the concept of organizational integrity has been largely ignored in organizational and management literature. This paper attempts to addresses this disconnect. Building on organizational values literature, we propose a social actor conception of organizational integrity. Organizational actors are increasingly portrayed as coherent, sovereign and integrated wholes, self-imposing a plurality of collective social and economic responsibilities, while simultaneously being internally fragmented and imbued with inconsistencies and tensions as a result of competing institutional demands. We argue that this fact of organizational life poses significant challenges for the maintenance of organizational integrity, and we have set out to theorize on how the coherence between the values reflected in organizational talk, operational and social structures, and actions might be frustrated."
2019,"Killing Boredom: On the Expansion and Contraction of Time in Organizational Transformation While time has become an important topic in management research, the role of an Einsteinian conception of time as dynamic and agentically experienced has only recently gained momentum. We conducted a longitudinal case study in a German IT company going through a series of organizational transformations in order to explore the question: How does temporal structuring contribute to the production and re-creation of an organizations identity? We depict that identity transformations were enabled by an interplay between expansions and contractions of time among top management. More specifically, we depict that boredom was a pivotal mechanism through which organizational transformation was initiated. Management experienced boredom, i.e., periods of time expansions, and engaged in strategic initiatives for the sake of killing it, resulting in contractions of time. With our study we contribute to the literature of organizational identity, time and temporality, and to the burgeoning stream of boredom in organizations."
2019,"Historical Narratives as a Change Facilitator in a Buddhist Temple This paper examines the enabling role of history in facilitating organizational change. Change is often inevitable to sustain a long-standing organization; however, change creates a dilemma by modifying the historical tradition that is deeply rooted in organizational rules and practices. Contemporary Buddhist temples confront such a dilemma, as they attempt to implement changes while simultaneously protecting their monastic traditions. To investigate how a Master Monk addressed the dilemma, I engaged in ethnographic fieldwork in a Korean Buddhist temple where the dilemma was most salient. In the data analysis, my focus moved from the change per se to the set of historical narratives the Master Monk used to facilitate his organizational change initiatives. A systematic analysis of these narratives shows that the Master Monk interpreted historical stories, myths, and legends; developed them as rich rhetorical sources; and then skillfully narrated them to facilitate changes. In theorizing the finding, I develop the concept of the historical toolkit, which integrates the historical narrative literature with the cultural toolkit concept."
2019,"Time will Tell: Temporal Tensions in NGO  Business Partnerships for Sustainability This article examines the role of temporal tensions in NGO-business partnerships for sustainability. Temporal tensions are defined as clashes of ideas, objectives, values, principles, logics or/and actions-and the discord that may arise thereof -which emerge as competing temporal demands and are underpinned by different time-related perceptions, practices and norms. To scrutinize the character of temporal tensions, the processes by which they emerge and develop, and the ways in which partners navigate them, the article draws on a case study of the Danish Red Cross. The findings reveal four sets of tensions around time horizons (short term vs. long term), temporal perspectives (clock-time vs. process time), speed levels (fast vs. slow), and temporal foci (present vs. future), as well as actors attempts to accommodate and resolve them. The article explicates the challenges that temporal tensions pose to NGO-business partnerships and broadens conceptualizations of the ability of organizations to address temporal tensions. In so doing, it furthermore elucidates implications of temporal tensions for sustainability."
2019,"Mechanisms of Failure of Rhetorical History Targeting Internal Organization The purpose of this research is to clarify the mechanism of failure when rhetorical history targets inside an organization. Rhetorical history in an organization is often practiced in various context. Most of the existing research deals with cases where executives succeed in encouraging stakeholders' actions as they intended. However, rhetorical history does not always function as intended by such user. Existing research tends to overlook the failure of rhetorical history, and sufficient discussion about the mechanism of failure has not been done. In this research, we comprehensively clarified the mechanism of failure when the rhetorical history targeting inside the organization fails. Firstly, rhetorical history is not always accepted by audiences. We proposed four factors of non-acceptance, such as lack of authenticity, lack of credibility, lack of expectation of outcome, and lack of validity. Secondly, there is a possibility that unfavorable consequences may occur even if it is accepted. We invoked classification by Nietzsche and discussed about three types of history which lead to unfavorable consequences- monumental history, antiquarian history, and critical history. Finally, we pointed out that when rhetorical history is practiced for the purpose of gaining legitimacy, failure is likely to occur because of arbitrary use of history."
2019,"Assembling Expertise: Emerging Governance of Algorithmic Systems in New York City Algorithms are increasingly employed in organizations to automate all kinds of expert work. At the same time, these algorithmic systems have been found to perpetuate old biases and generate new ones. Policy-makers thus recently began to push for algorithmic accountability and oversight  modes of governance that inevitably require new experts. To better understand the twisted role of expertise in the governance of algorithmic systems, we present an in-depth case study of attempts to establish a new regime for algorithm governance in New York City. Building on recent studies that present expert work as a collaborative and co-creative rather than competitive and isolated process, we show how actors in NYC engage in three forms of relational work to create a new form of expertise: creating a void, assembling networks, and maintaining distance. With our study, we show that the assembling of expertise as an important, yet mostly neglected antecedent to the creation of new occupational mandates. We further show that expertise is not just an analytical category to analyze authority at the workplace, but that when facing the uncertainty of emerging technologies, actors can mobilize expertise as a governance resource."
2019,"Ingroup Flexibility: Evidence of Social Influence in Third-Party Regulation Markets We propose and test a group-based mechanism, ingroup bias, as a source of organizational failure for third-party regulators. Extant research examining third-party regulation has mainly investigated threats to objectivity resulting from strategic motivations for regulatory leniency and dyadic exchanges between regulators and regulated entities. We argue that regulatory organizations can fall short of objectivityeven even unintentionally through ingroup bias, a group-based mechanism that does not rely on either prior or future expected business with the regulated firm, incorporating the larger social environment in which a regulator is embedded. Using proprietary data from a prominent firm in the marine survey industry, which regulates the maritime sector, we exploit a natural experiment based on a high-profile industry accident that dramatically heightened the risks of regulatory leniency. We find that regulators are more lenient with their ingroup clients than outgroup clients, by observing a convergence in outcomes for these groups only after the accident. We further find that this leniency is driven by individuals who identify less with their regulatory profession and are thus more susceptible to ingroup bias. Our findings underscore the importance of categorical biases and identities in regulatory processes and how regulatory firms can inadvertently fail to maintain objectivity."
2019,"Striking out Swinging: The Upside of Forced Inferiority Will professionals perform worse on core competencies after frustrating compulsory tasks in which they are inferior, as expected from job design and professions theory? Or will they respond by outperforming expectations in core tasks? We test these alternative expectations using a large data set of all at-bats taken in Major League Baseball (MLB) games played under National League (NL) rules from 1997-2018. Exploiting the quasi-random timing of when a pitcher must pitch following their own at-bat, we find that instances where a pitcher makes an out as a batter in the half-inning prior to pitching, the pitcher is then more likely to get the first batters of the following half-inning out than would otherwise be expected controlling for pitcher, inning, and other relevant fixed effects. These results suggest that when professionals engage in a frustrating task, they are likely to over-perform when returning to tasks in which they excel. We support these conclusions with context-specific robustness checks and discuss the managerial implications of these findings."
2019,"An Empirical Investigation into Market Orientations Impact on Customer-Based Brand Performance Theory suggests that market orientation (MO) provides firms with a better understanding of its customers, which ultimately leads to enhanced customer value. However, empirical findings on customers outcomes remain scarce and the substantial link between MO and customer-based brand performance is yet to be understood. Grounded on customer-based brand equity theory this study investigates how an increase in MO influences customers brand perceptions, particularly in environments characterized by market and technological turbulence. Using large-scale customer data over 10 years, our results reveal that an increase in MO is positively related to an increase in customer-based brand awareness and brand strength. While market turbulence amplifies the positive link between MO and brand strength, technological turbulence weakens this relationship. Our findings entail important implications for marketing literature and for practitioners."
2019,"The Accelerator as an Organizational Form: A Review and Reconceptualization While the widespread phenomenon of the business or seed accelerator has enjoyed increasing attention amongst scholars, the lack of a coherent and theoretically grounded understanding of this organizational form constrains the cumulativeness and transferability of findings. By drawing on a systematic literature review, we identify four distinct research orientations on the accelerator: organizational learning and adaptation, entrepreneurial finance, entrepreneurial ecosystems, and corporate innovation and entrepreneurship. We compare and contrast these orientations along the organizational features that they attribute to the accelerator and synthesize them into an integrative typology. We further distinguish the accelerator from other established organizational forms in the entrepreneurial support landscape and develop a research agenda that contributes to integration of the literature by building bridges between the different research orientations and linking the concept to established theories."
2019,"'Pure' Information Provision: The Implications of Artificial Intelligence for Organizational Design The scope of a firms activities increasingly extends to agents located external to traditional organizational boundaries. Many powerful firms now use artificial intelligence as a tool to self-organize these external agents by providing information for them to concurrently frame and find problems on their own. Existing theories cannot account for such forms of organizing due to an implicit assumption that the firm determines problems. Drawing on theories of computing, I frame firms use of artificial intelligence as an organizational design strategy of pure information provision, based on acquiring and representing data about activities without pre-determining problems, tasks or roles. I show how the strategy enables agents to generate implicit knowledge, dependent on a firms data abstraction capabilities. Beyond contributing to our understanding of a nascent phenomenon, the framework offers a path to more richly integrating extant micro-level approaches to organizational design and capabilities into strategy research on firm boundaries. I propose ideas and methods from computing as a basis for such future work."
2019,"A Configuration Perspective of Project Management In this paper, I build a typology of project organizations. It is built on the basis of four imperatives of relevance in the project management field: environment conditions, project structure, top management support and project maturity. With these four variables, I identify 16 different types, including 5 archetypes. I also introduce the notion of readiness which contends that value and fit are integral for the efficiency of project within organizations. In this regard, I link the 16 types to different project toolsets based on each types readiness."
2019,"Sharing is Caring: How Decentralization in DLTBO Drives the Success of Temporary Organizations Reacting to the fast-moving environment of the information technology-driven global economy, firms are increasingly putting their hopes on temporary forms of organizing to account for the need of flexibility and accelerated task fulfilment. The latest developments in distributed ledger technology (DLT; e.g., blockchain technology) have been substantially altering our understanding of coordinating activities among distributed actors thereby enabling novel forms of temporary organizations (e.g., distributed autonomous organizations; DAOs). By further decentralizing the organizational solutions to the four universal problems of organizing, DLT may positively influence the performance of temporary organizations. Integrating research on novel forms of organizing with work on governance in project and network theory, we theorize on the relationship between decentralization and temporariness as well as drivers of success in DLT-based organizations (DLTBO). We posit that DLTBO classify for a new form of temporary organizations exhibiting stronger degrees of decentralization, that may dissolve tensions of goal alignment within temporary organizations. Bridging structural and temporal perspectives of organization research, our article advances recent theorizing on DLT-based decentralized organizations and contributes to the literature on temporary organizing by suggesting a novel and distinct organizational form, and examining the influences, its mechanisms may have on the performance and duration of temporary organizations."
2019,"The Folding of Organizational Tensions Organizational tensions are often considered intrinsically binary by nature, yet many represent complex, multipolar tensions that involve multiple stakeholder interests. Only more recently, the literature has acknowledged the complexity of organizational tensions whereby actors face sets of interwoven and nested tensions that are not dyadic. However, it is unclear through which mechanisms actors deal with this inherent complexity of organizational tensions. In this paper, we address this gap by studying the question how actors construct dyadic tensions from complex sets of interwoven tensions among multiple actors. We conduct an inductive case study of social entrepreneurs and their accounts for social impact. We find that social entrepreneurs discursively reduce the complexity of multiple interwoven and multipolar tensions through the mechanism of folding. Through folding, people temporarily align different actors and their interests with either pole of a binary tension. We identify the underlying rationale and different stages of folding (bracketing, collapsing, and releasing). As our main contribution, we identify the discursive mechanism through which actors reduce the complexity of interwoven tensions by temporarily forming distinct dyadic tensions. We also show that the mechanism of folding is an interest-based mechanism, which highlights the role of political aspects of responses to tensions, aspects that have been understudied in the literature to date."
2019,"Tensions of Ambidextrous Change: Evolutionary View to Tension Emergence and Resolution Technological transformations such as digitalization creates major tensions for managers pursuing to retain the current sources of competitiveness, while innovating new ones. In this environment, companies need to be ambidextrous  able to handle both exploration and exploitation at the same time. In this study, we analyze a longitudinal single-case study of a regional media company undergoing a major digital transformation. We examine the variety of tensions arising from the ambidexterity demands faced by the managers in the company, the ways how the company pursues to manage these tensions, and finally, how managers are able to revolve those tensions over time. We find evidence of contextual simultaneity, path-dependence, structural heterogeneity and resource scarcity related tensions. Each of these tension types are either retained, reinforced, or resolved over time as the organization changes. We also find that the tension resolution takes place both due to deliberate organizational arrangements aimed to manage ambidextrous demands, as well as through evolutionary mechanisms such as experiential learning in the individual level, as well as improvements in the capability-environment fit. The results contribute to our understanding of the organizational tensions emerging from the ambidextrous demands of digitalization and other social and technological transformations."
2019,"Navigating Occupational Paradox through Managing Compatibility While scholarship details how to address organizational-level paradox, how employees navigate occupational-level paradox remains little understood. Drawing from an analysis of 40 interviews with corporate grantmakers and observational data of their professional networking meetings, I argue that an important way that individuals navigate paradox is through compatibility presentations, or the process of reducing conflict around competing elements when interacting with others. Grantmakers intentionally portrayed their work to others in ways that differed from their private understandings. For themselves, grantmakers made sense of their work in an integrative and expansive manner. Yet when interacting with others, grantmakers favored either a dominantly economic or dominantly social impact presentation of their work, adjusting to the perceived preferences of their various audiences. This code-switching behavior meant grantmakers were inconsistent across situations. I further detail the features that support their compatibility presentations:1) occupational socialization, 2) multivocal measures, and 3) reaffirmation events. While most studies of paradox detail how organizational leaders ensure their employees do not face daily paradox, this study instead shows how individuals navigate daily paradox when their larger organization does not make space for them to do so. The results have implications for paradox management and navigating the relationship between business and society."
2019,"From Taking to Making Paradox: A Multi-Level Perspective on How CEOs Balance Nested Paradoxes Based on a unique dataset of interviews with 146 interviews with CEOs of multinational corporations, we develop a multi-level perspective on the paradoxical tensions CEOs experience at the individual level, as an organizational leader, and a corporate diplomat interfacing with the organizations external environment. Using this perspective, we make three contributions to the literature on paradoxical leadership. First, rather than perceiving themselves as passive takers of the tensions they experience, CEOs perceive they have discretion in defining and dealing with those tensions, thereby actively choosing why they engage with tensions and how to make them salient. Second, CEOs developed very practical approaches in how to deal with tensions. Many of those approaches were paradoxical in their own right and were part of the everyday work of CEOs rather than special or rare aspects of their work. Third, as active shapers of paradox, we found that CEOs choose what kind of tensions to deal with -and where - as encountered at, but also across organizational, individual, or institutional levels. These contributions enable us to reach beyond simplified notions of dyadic contradictions that have dominated the paradox, ambidexterity and institutional complexity literatures to paint a more realistic picture of 21st century leadership challenges."
2019,"Timing and Function of Top Management Team Changes in Organizational Decline and Turnaround This study explores how different patterns of change in the top management teams affect the outcomes of turnaround firms replacing their CEOs, using a sample of 14 successful and unsuccessful turnaround cases. Our research follows a two-phase approach, first generating insights from three cases (3 pairs), and then cross validating our findings with an additional eight cases (4 pairs). Overall, our findings suggest that the timing, type, and functional domain of top management change systematically affect turnaround outcomes. Successful turnarounds exhibited top management changes in primary functions/business units resulting in vacant top management positions prior to the new CEOs arrival while maintaining management stability in support functions after the new CEOs arrival. Unsuccessful turnarounds involved personnel replacements in primary functions/business units and the departures of top managers for other opportunities after the new CEO arrival. This study extends the literature on top management change and corporate turnaround by being the first to examine patterns between the context and timing of changes in the top management team and turnaround outcomes."
2019,"Eyes on the Horizon? Fragmented Elites and the Short-Term Focus of the American Corporation In recent years, scholars and popular commentators have expressed concerns that U.S. corporations are too focused on short-term performance, thereby undermining their long-term health and competitiveness. This paper examines how this focus on short-term strategies and performance, or short-termism, results from the dissolution of the American corporate elite network. In particular, we argue that the corporate board interlock network traditionally served as an important collective resource that helped corporate elites to preserve their autonomy and control, mitigating short-termism. In recent years, changing board-appointment practices have fractured the board network, undermining its usefulness as a platform for collective action and exposing corporate leaders to short-term pressures. We develop and apply a cohesion metric for network managerialism, derived from theory and evidence in social-network scholarship. Using three indicators that capture short-termism earnings management and shareholder returns, we identify a structural basis for managerial short-termism that links external, network-based resources to managers decisions. The results highlight the benefits of the corporate elite network and illustrate unforeseen consequences of the networks dissolution."
2019,"Performance Shortfall and Board Political Capital Building: A Behavioral Model of Director Selection While research typically emphasizes the role of board capital in mitigating uncertainty, we argue that board political capital per se could be a source of uncertainty. Drawing on the behavioral theory of the firm (BTOF), this study theorizes board political capital building as a form of problemistic search in response to performance shortfalls  pursuing potential gains while taking the associated risks. In the context of director selection, we propose that firms performing below aspirations are more inclined to appoint new independent directors (IDs) with political backgrounds (PBs). Based on director selection data on 897 Chinese listed manufacturing firms from 2008 to 2013, we find support for this argument, which is contingent on the identity of dominant coalitions and regional market institutions. Our study advances the director selection literature by offering the new insight that director selection decisions may not be made simply based on the anticipated functional benefits from candidates; instead, our theory and findings suggest that such decisions represent a balance between prospective benefits and potential side effects. Additionally, this study contributes to the BTOF literature by extending the problemistic search logic to the political strategy domain."
2019,"The Restructuring Imperative: Deviation, Performance and CEO Dismissal in the Shareholder Value Era This paper proposes that CEO dismissal is a form of penalty that CEOs incur for their record of deviation from historically prevailing norms of appropriate behavior during performance downturns. To verify this argument, I examine CEO dismissal and post-dismissal strategic change in large U.S. companies between 1984 and 2007, when the field in which these firms were embedded was characterized by the prominence of the norms of corporate restructuring for shareholders. My findings are three-fold. First, the effect of performance declines on CEO dismissal was intensified by the extent to which CEOs held a record of deviation from the norms of restructuringi.e., that of increasing assets, employees, and unrelated diversification. Second, new CEOs were more inclined to engage in restructuring when they took office following the dismissal of predecessors with a record of deviation. Finally, those patterns of CEO dismissal and post-dismissal restructuring became more evident over time as the norms developed. Meanwhile, the findings did not apply prior to the shareholder value era. Consequently, this paper suggests that institutional norms act as interpretive frameworks that enable a board of directors to make sense of performance problems and evaluate managerial competence to resolve those problems. Implications for the literatures on institutional theory and upper echelon research are discussed."
2019,"Which Kind of Employees Benefits More from Gender Diversity? Extant research has shown that gender-diverse organizations tend to be more innovative than gender homogenous ones but has left unaddressed the question of who, among an organizations workforce, becomes more innovative as gender diversity increases. We address this question by examining how gender diversity affects individual-level innovative performance, measured through patent-based indicators, within the R&D; labs of the 40 largest pharmaceutical companies over the period 1985-2010. We argue that higher levels of gender diversity increase the performance of three categories of scientists  women, rookies, and brokers  whereas men, long-tenured scientists, and scientists embedded in constrained networks experience limited or no performance benefits. By demonstrating that gender diversity has a heterogeneous effect across different segments of an organizations workforce, these results both deepen and qualify current understandings of how gender diversity affects innovation within organizations. A key implication of our proposed argument is that gender diversity does not only affect the overall performance of the organization; it also affects how performance (and hence the material and symbolic resources associated with it) are distributed within the organization."
2019,"Too Busy to Wonder? CEO Job Demands and Firms Innovation Performance Although there is increasing interest in how top executives influence firms innovation performance, extant research has focused exclusively on top executives cognition and individual characteristics. We draw from psychological research on job demands to explain how this key attribute of top executives job environment influences firms innovation. Our theory explains why CEO job demands negatively influence firms innovation performance, and how the negative effect of CEO job demands can be weakened by CEOs need for achievement, employees human capital, and firms ties to the government. Using survey data collected on-site from hundreds of Chinese companies, we find support for our theory. This study contributes to research on innovation and strategic leadership by explaining how characteristics of CEOs job environment influence firms innovation performance."
2019,"Experience Instability Together: A Firm-Level View on Divorce This paper investigates how various sources of instability originating at work affect the stability of marriage. We propose that organizational characteristics of employer types anchor basic qualities of organizations that shape employee experience and isolate this structural effect from individuals selection choices. The results reveal that workers of entrepreneurial ventures (categories of small young and large young organizations) have higher divorce hazards compared to employees of established (large old) firms, even after using an instrumental variables strategy and account for the heterogeneity in individual propensities to seek out different types of employers. Our models also include effects of instabilities within organizations and in the life-course. Moreover, we also show that partner fit with respect to employer type can offset the negative mechanisms entrepreneurial environments facilitate: couples both working for an entrepreneurial venture have the lowest divorce rates. These results are also robust to a research design that takes into account partner and employer selection. The presented results lend support to the insight that organizational structures vary in their instabilities and highlight that joint employer type choice has a cementing quality that can offset the negative mechanisms unsettled organizational environments facilitate."
2019,"Reciprocity or Monetary Incentive? Network-Activation Strategies and Referrals to Investors We shed light on the micro-processes of entrepreneurial resource mobilization by investigating how entrepreneurs elicit referrals from their pre-existing network contacts to gain access to seed-round investors. We theorize network activation strategies by which entrepreneurs persuade their network contact to initiate referrals. Our conceptual model distinguishes between activation strategies that elicit contacts cooperation by appeals to reciprocity versus offers of monetary incentive. We test our predictions in a field experiment at an Indian entrepreneurship accelerator and two within-subject vignette experiments with executives. Results across the three studies suggest that network-activation strategies that emphasize reciprocity rather than monetary incentive are more effective in securing referrals to seed-round investors, particularly when the entrepreneur has strong ties to the network contact."
2019,"Legitimacy, Government Regulations and the Emergence of the Market for Cryptocurrencies Building on legitimacy in institutional theory research, we theorize how the perception of regulative legitimacy based on strong versus weak government regulations varies in conjunction with institutional voids, country level corruption and trust and its implications on the emergence of the market for cryptocurrencies (i.e. Bitcoin trading) from 2013 to 2017 in 45 countries. We find that strong regulations based on the declaration of Bitcoins as either legal or illegal makes Bitcoin trading in a country less attractive  even under high corruption. However, in the context of institutional voids strong regulations facilitate Bitcoin trading while in the context of high social trust, strong regulations hamper it. Our study contributes to a better understanding of new market emergence and the tension between (il)legality and (il)legitimacy in different institutional settings."
2019,"With Cheaters We all Prosper?: Micro-Movements through Rankings and their Systemic Implications Reputation rankings and other forms of social hierarchy have long been used to motivate cooperation. Yet, recent research warns that pressures associated with gains and losses in rank may incite cheating and deception, suggesting that rankings may undermine continued cooperation. This study seeks to understand whether rankings can offset the negative externalities they produce. Using data from an organization that utilizes a ranking to motivate cooperative behavior, I examine over 1.2 million observations of individuals weekly movements through a ranking and their corresponding rates of cooperative and uncooperative behaviors. I find that increases in rank are associated with a higher likelihood of uncooperative behavior, such as cheating. However, actors that exhibit uncooperative behavior tend to cooperate more than actors that never exhibit uncooperative behavior. These findings suggest that upward movements through rankings create pressures that increase the likelihood of uncooperative behaviors, but that individuals who are most susceptible to these pressures are on average more cooperative. At the level of a system this suggests that cooperation can be maintained even though rankings produce pressures that perturb a system. Ultimately uncooperative behaviors such as cheating, may not be harbingers of failing systems of cooperation, but instead may be symptoms of robustness."
2019,"The Production of Trust in Global Platform-based Markets Classical theoretical propositions in sociology of markets stress three mechanisms of trust production in market exchanges: homophily-based, process-based, and institutionally-based. Todays platform-based peer-to-peer markets provide a unique opportunity to test the interplays of these mechanisms. Specifically, whether process-based and institutionally-based quality signals for trustworthiness can counteract homophily in global online markets, and whether homophily can in turn influence the efficacy of the latter two quality signals. Using a proprietary dataset of a global peer-to-peer home swap platform, I show that both types of quality signals can offset the tendency to rely on cultural-homophily-based trust, but cultural dissimilarities can bifurcate the efficacy of these quality signals: as cultural dissimilarity between market actors increases, the effect of process-based quality signals is mitigated, but the effect of institutionally-based quality signals is enhanced. This study corroborates the classical theoretical proposition that formal modes of trust production are the sine qua non for modern markets where transactions occur across heterogenous social groups. The investigation of the divergent interaction effects of process-based and institutionally-based quality signals with cultural dissimilarities also suggests unexplored contingencies to theories of homophily and double standards."
2019,"Do I Want My Money Backed? Trust Ambivalence & Business Consequences Ensuing Indias Demonetization This multi-method study brings the topic of money back into business scholarship by investigating how the relationship between institutional trust and trust in money affects organizational growth. Using demonetization in India as our empirical setting, we first use qualitative data and find that the policy shock implemented in 2016 by the government created institutional trust ambivalence (i.e. some dimensions of trust were affected positively and others negatively). Then, using theory on attributional search and social evaluation spillovers, we hypothesize and demonstrate empirically, with a regression discontinuity design, that trust ambivalence provides growth opportunities for business organizations acting as alternative trustees to government. Specifically, we show that organizations without ties to the government benefit the most from institutional trust ambivalence, especially private banks (to process payments) and cryptocurrency organizations (to store value). Our study contributes to the interdisciplinary literature on institutional trust and money and reconnects the notion of institutional trust to organizational growth and industry evolution."
2019,"How Firms Competitively Became Anti-competitive: The Diffusion of Noncompete Agreements, 1996-2015 This paper examines organizational-, sub-population, and population-level factors to explain rapid and widespread diffusion of contested practices whose legitimacy and effectiveness are debatable. Taking noncompete agreements with CEOs as an example of contested practices, this paper shows that contestation both within and beyond the organization as well as unexpected shocks can undermine or facilitate diffusion of noncompete agreements across the biggest U.S. corporations. First, consistent with studies that focus on internal contestation between management and the firm, this paper finds that organizations are less likely to adopt noncompete agreements with powerful CEOs. Second, this paper explores the impact of variation in legal environments among different U.S. states and reveals that organizations do not only comply with mandates from legal environments but also actively test the limit to the legality of their NCA use. Finally, this paper investigates exogenous disruptions that broadly affect organizations across different legal environments. In anticipation of financial strain, organizations could be more likely to adopt practices that they otherwise reconsider due to opposition. Findings show that as the recent financial crisis incurred extraordinary losses or caused such concerns, organizations were far more likely to adopt a noncompete agreement with their CEOs."
2019,"Local Upper-Class Clubs as Backstages: The Diffusion of Stock Backdating We examined the diffusion of stock option backdating, an unethical corporate practice about which public information was virtually absent until 2005. In contrast to corporate practices accessible to outsiders, this invisible practice did not diffuse through board interlocks. Rather, stock option backdating spread through geographic proximity, indicating the importance of localized interactions among members of the business elite. We offer a nuanced analysis of these interactions by exploring local upper-class clubs as backstages for invisible practices and differentiating types of local upper-class clubs. We find that the impact of geographic proximity on the diffusion of backdating is enhanced by the presence of golf clubs but weakened by the presence of professional clubs, service clubs, and religious clubs. Together these findings suggest that invisible corporate practices could follow some unique diffusion patterns."
2019,"The Fitful Diffusion of a Mandated Policy: Antecedents and Consequences of No Child Left Behind This study analyzes how and why well-defined and seemingly well-regarded policies/practices may diffuse only fitfully, along with the performance outcomes associated with such a diffusion process. By seeking to identify the multiple antecedents associated with the uneven acceptance and modification (or even transmogrification) of a newly articulated policy, the study endeavors to shed light on the socio-economic, socio-cultural, and socio-political factors that affect the specific diffusion path of a major policy. We advance the notion of a normative and multi-dimensional policy/adopter fit, highlighting how and why specific differences in technical, cultural, and political imply predictable differences in both policy implementation and policy success. We contextualize our analysis by examining the rise (and partial fall) of a major U.S. educational policy initiative known as No Child Left Behind (NCLB) from its inception in 2003 to its end as an identifiable policy in 2015. In particular, we analyze the path from global policy formulation to local policy adaptation/implementation, explaining how and why the interpretation and implementation of NCLB varied significantly across adopting states, along with its consequences for relevant targeted stakeholders (schools and students). We conclude with a discussion of our theoretical perspective and empirical findings for research on the uneven diffusion of practices and policies."
2019,"When Knowledge Sharing Spreads Bad Ideas Strategic decisions can be hard, and when facing hard problems, individuals commonly seek others advice. But what makes a problem hard  incomplete data, ambiguous outcomes, foggy causality  can also frustrate the search for a good advisor. Although individuals must seek others for knowledge, they are often imperfect judges of advice quality. Relying on empirical evidence, we identify a mechanism that can cause the spread of bad advice, even without malintent or pressures for conformity. We begin by reviewing how individuals consistently misjudge relative performance, misestimating their own performance compared to others. We suggest that such misjudgment can occur in organizational and entrepreneurial environments. To understand possible outcomes, we craft computational studies from empirical results, examining how advice taking affects individual and organizational outcomes. Under realistic assumptions of environment and behaviors, we find, advice taking does not make individuals better  but similar. Top performers, particularly vulnerable to bad advice, can be extirpated. Surprisingly, the risk decreases with behaviors often portrayed negatively, such as inertia, in-group bias, and social clustering. For scholars of organizations and knowledge, we offer a novel mechanism rooted in evidence. It is distinct from prior concerns about conformity, and thus may be resistant to proposed remedies. For practitioners, we sound a warning against the risks of popular managerial and entrepreneurial practices."
2019,"Logic Multiplicity and Organizational Competitiveness Researchers predict that organizations that integrate highly conflicting logics into their core activities are less likely to succeed than organizations that prioritize institutional templates. This paper studies two cases that challenge these predictions, investigating how, and under what conditions, the instantiation of conflicting logics affect organizations competitiveness. The results show that organizations that present high logic centrality access a broader set of alternative market strategies, which may translate into a higher competitive agility and a privileged access to primary resources, which are essential for the organizations commercial success. However, while at the strategy level such organizations access a multiplicity of options, at the practice level the compromise amongst conflicting logics translates into a reduced set of available actions, pushing organizations towards a compromise zone lock-in effect. In volatile and highly competitive markets, where non-commercial constituents provide a primary resource, the benefits of increased competitive agility and privileged access to primary resources might overcome the costs of being locked into the compromise zone. Under these conditions, organizations that present high logic centrality may be more competitive than organizations that have a clear logic hierarchy."
2019,"Institutional Complexity and the Process of Innovation This paper addresses the question of how organization operating in complex institutional environments secure innovative benefits from dynamically combining rather than blending or decoupling competing institutional logics. To contribute a novel perspective to theoretical debate, we focus on the innovation process within firms. We draw on the findings from an empirical study of three biotechnology firms, and show how tensions between science, commercial and regulatory logics are experienced primarily through the different temporal orientations they bring to the innovation process. Through improvised bridging strategies of expanding, intensifying and focusing, the firms in our study were able to accommodate these orientations by dynamically allocating time to project activities; sustaining the integrity of different logics, but limiting the time available for their application. Our study thus contributes to theory development by outlining a model of the temporal coupling of competing logics within the innovation process."
2019,"Institutional Complexity as a Strategic Resource: Navigating the Field Following a Disruption We investigated how actors navigate an organizational field marked by prolonged institutional complexity following changes initiated by a government reform. In fields marked by prolonged complexity, individuals can meaningfully engage with multiple logics available to them to respond to change. When changes in the external environment disrupt previously forged pragmatic collaborations, actors may be forced to renegotiate their field positions. Through the analysis of a multiple case study, we show how actors navigated the field and renegotiated their position by engaging with institutional logics as tools. We uncover the use of three key strategies: defending, co-opting, and reframing. Depending upon which strategies are used following a disruption, the formation of new collaborations, particularly when power dynamics have shifted, may prove to be difficult. We contribute to the literature on institutional complexity and logics, showing how actors strategically engage with logics to navigate fields marked by prolonged complexity, and the effect of these strategies on the formation of pragmatic collaborations."
2019,"Liberalization and Legitimacy: Relationship Formation in a Newly Liberalized Market In this study, we examine how and why private and state organizations in the post liberalization period form relationships. The Chinese bond market liberalization in 2007 provides a natural setting to explore whether liberalization promotes competitive, resource-based relationships among organizations or rather, perpetuates the prior legitimacy of state organizations in market relations. Probit models show that private firms generally rely on state banks for raising bond finance. However, private firms with stock exchange listing are less likely to rely on state banks. State firms neither rely on state banks nor rely on private banks exclusively to raise bond finance, demonstrating their overriding legitimacy and access in the market. Thus, firms without prior legitimacy (either through being a state firm or through stock market listing) continue to rely on state banks to raise finance. The results hold even after we account for firms financial characteristics, industries, geographic locations, and market environment factors. Overall, the present research shows that the prior legitimacy (or lack thereof) drives the pattern of relationship formation observed in a newly liberalized market segment."
2019,"What do Social Activists Look for? Identifying Configurations of the Corporate Opportunity Structure Prior research on the corporate opportunity structure for social activism has yet to consider the possibility that social activists are likely to perceive and evaluate the attractiveness of firms as viable targets holisticallythat is, as complex configurations (i.e., prototypes) of characteristics, rather than as lists of independent factors. As such, extant research on the corporate opportunity structure has not addressed why and how configurations of firm characteristics cause some firms to be more highly targeted than others. I seek to develop a comprehensive understanding of configurations of the corporate opportunity structure for social activism; that is, combinations of firm characteristics that make such firms more highly targeted by social activists than others. To do so, I integrate extant theory and research on the key features of corporations that impact the likelihood of a firm being targeted by social activists. I use fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to investigate the combinations of corporations' features that exist among S&P; 500 firms that increase the likelihood that such firms will be targeted by social activism. From this analysis, I develop an initial typology of different corporate opportunity structures and thus, offer a mid-range theory of the corporate opportunity structure for social activism."
2019,"Tweet, Frame and Repeat: Evidence on Individual Mobilization Outcomes from an Online Health Campaign Social movement research has long been part of studying how framing processes and emotional involvement influence participation in collective action. However, little is known about how these micro-level mechanisms affect individual mobilization outcomes in online social movement campaigns. In this study, I first explore how social movement organizations framing, through the use of language, symbols, and slogans, characterizes movement members discourse in social media and the extent to which the movements dominant framing becomes hegemonic during online mobilization. Then, I investigate how movement members adoption of the movements dominant framing in the online discourse and their level of emotional involvement in the framing process influence individual fundraising outcomes during a health-related campaign on Twitter. By combining automated text analysis, the use of a plagiarism detector, network visualizations, and regression analysis, I find that almost one-third of the discourse that movement members generated on Twitter during the campaign aligns with the Movember Foundations dominant framing. However, the more movement members use the movements language, slogans, and frames in their tweets, the less they collected in donations. By contrast, the use of emotional language in framing processes was positively associated with the amount collected in donations. In this way, I show the importance of the authenticity of communication and emotions as important micro-mobilization dynamics related to individual participation in online social movement campaigns. This study contributes to research on social movements, organizations, media, and communication."
2019,"Inertia Busters: Social Movement Influence on Impervious Incumbents facing Environmental Turbulence Environmental change pressures incumbent organizations to decide when to adapt and exit from investments in a declining technology. As the alternatives become more economically feasible, companies will vary in how responsive they are to the shifting competitive circumstances. We investigate how contentious activism can prod recalcitrant companies to hasten their exit. This mechanism helps to account for movement influence on targets that are otherwise impervious to activism. It also broadens research on incumbent adaptation and strategic change to consider external stakeholders that accelerate rather than delay change. We find support for our theory from an analysis of coal plant retirements in the U.S. from 2008-2015."
2019,"A Performative Perspective On Institutional Disruption: Investigating Regulatory De-Capturing... We conducted a longitudinal case study on the disruption of the institutionalized neoliberal belief system that had contributed to regulatory capture in the corporate taxation field in the United Kingdom. Specifically, we investigated why the problematizations communicated by one public interest group succeeded in gaining the public attention and support necessary for challenging and disrupting the institutional quo and why the problematizations communicated by a previous public interest group, despite their similar ideational content, failed to do so. Our comparative analysis led us toward developing a performative perspective on challengers problematization work which highlights the critical role of dramatic enactments in gaining sufficient attention and support in the public sphere for institutional disruption to occur."
2019,"We Are All Made of Glitter: Emotional Contagion, Empathy, and Legitimacys Double-Edged Sword Legitimacy is critical to the formation and expansion of nascent fields because it lends credibility and recognizability to once overlooked actors and practices, drawing resources and organizations to the field. At the same time, legitimacy can be a double-edged sword precisely because it facilitates field growth, attracting actors with discrepant practices and creating pressures for differentiation that may lead to factionalization and undermine the coherence of the fields collective identity. In this paper, we investigate how organizations can mitigate the downside of legitimation by eliciting emotions that align increasingly heterogeneous actors and commit them to an inclusive collective identity. We leverage fieldwork and computational text analysis to examine the relationship between legitimation, collective identity coherence, and emotions in the context of the Makers, a nascent field of do-it-yourself hobbyists and technology hackers. We find that legitimation was associated with increased field heterogeneity but that leading organizations in the Maker field aligned actors from different backgrounds by sponsoring collective events that aroused emotional contagion and empathy among actors. These emotions reconciled tensions among increasingly diverse actors and served to maintain the coherence of the Maker collective identity by aligning the stories that were told about the field. We conclude by discussing how theories of emotion can contribute to research on cultural entrepreneurship, optimal distinctiveness, field-configuring events, and social movements and markets."
2019,"The Evolutionary Story of Labels in a New Market Space: Through the Lens of Crowds Prior research focuses on how categories form to define a new market. The present study directs attention at how, before the category formation, a shared sense of comparability emerges in the absence of central coordinating forces that can drive the market conversation in a certain way (cf., social movement theory). From the crowds uncoordinated and massively distributed production and consumption of new labels, how do social codes emerge and get elaborated? Why are some labels more likely than others to be noticed (i.e., variation) and remembered (i.e., selective retention) to be used as part of firms organizational discourse (i.e., organizational retention)? Using over 33.9 million social media posts relating to the Internet of Things (IoT) between July 2009 and March 2017 and real-time identity accounts of 1,767 IoT-related ventures since their founding, the study finds that shifts in the distribution of labels, some of which prevail and get recorded into collective memory, are driven by the ways in which different labels co-evolve in the context of one another and the communicators who repeat them. Furthermore, empirical analyses find that the crowds semantic evolution is completed when the coded labels are propagated across new ventures identity statements, thereby giving categorical structure to the otherwise catastrophic label-verse."
2019,"Collective Identity Formation in a New Technical Field: The Case of Grid Computing How can diverse organizational participants in emerging fields coalesce around a collective identity when they are embedded in different cultures, traditions, and institutional logics? Specifically, what factors can enhance the emergence of a collective identity within a nascent field and what issues can cause such an identity to break down? This paper examines these questions using the case of Grid computing, a field that developed the technological precursor of todays disruptive Cloud Computing technology. Drawing on field work conducted at the Open Grid Forum  a major voluntary standards institution within the Grid field  as well as interviews, historical documents, and participation indicators, this paper suggests that fields composed of organizations that hold widely different perspectives use a form of flexible standards development that we call dance patterns to coordinate the construction of a pluralistic collective identity. Moreover, this paper show this pluralistic identity can fragment in response to pressures originating from competing fields."
2019,"When the Time Never Comes: Temporality and Legitimacy in a Nascent Field Perceptions of temporality have a significant impact on the legitimacy of a nascent field. Expectations play a particular role in legitimation in such contexts, and research identifies other types of temporal perceptions and dynamics that relate to change and the persistence of institutions. However, a coherent understanding of how temporality and legitimacy are intertwined in the development of nascent fields is still lacking. Drawing on a grounded study of the emergence of a solar energy field in a northern country where legitimation has been particularly challenging, we develop a framework for sustained temporal illegitimacy in nascent fields. We find that legitimation in temporal terms is apparent in their momentum, and that illegitimacy is produced by two types of asynchronicity that reduce momentum  asynchronicity in the perceived rhythm of local field development as reflected against the rhythm of an acute global challenge, and asynchronicity in the timing of engagement among participating communities. These two types produce a lack of concerted action and stalling momentum. We discuss the implications of our findings for studies on temporality and institutions in the legitimation of nascent fields, as well as for related research on expectations and hypes related to the emergence of a new field."
2019,"Ontological Drifts, Implications for Practice, and Legitimacy in Management Research Many leading management journals require authors to discuss the implications of their research for practice. We elaborate why this requirement creates an ontological challenge that may force authors to engage in ontological drifting. We consider the broader context into which such ontological drifts are embedded, where academics and fields struggle for legitimacy, coping with demands for both rigor and relevance. Building on institutional theory, we suggest that drifting might be more prevalent in management than in other fields, and is most evident in its emerging sub-fields. We argue that ontological drifts are a case of institutional work, a tactic of institutional entrepreneurs, and play an important role in field renewal of established field, and emergence of new fields."
2019,"Translating Verve: The Institutional Work of the Bossa Nova Crossover, 1955-1967 We conduct a historical study of the translation of Bossa Nova from the musical genres origin in Brazil to the United States, where it became a major influence on Jazz and popular forms of music. We found that across three periods the types of work performed by actors varied across four types: creating, evangelizing, shepherding, and blaspheming. These actions by distributed sets of actors advanced the genre, ensured the integrity of the genre, and slowed its spread. This work was not limited to mediators and parties in the recipient context, but to creators in the original context that sought to promote and safeguard their cultural product. This suggests that the translation process, particularly when concerning cultural products, might fluctuate between being a hand off between parties but a flow ebbed and driven by interests that may grow to span boundaries."
2019,"The Role of Professional Values in the Institutional Work of Heterogeneous Actors In this paper, we explore how French biologists and gynaecologists engage in institutional work to both challenge and change existing institutional arrangements primarily related to the regulations of their practices. As the French regulation is more restrictive as compared to other European countries, in March 2016, around 200 French gynaecologists and biologists actively contested the regulation and pushed for radical change. The French Bioethical Laws, which go under revision every 5-7 years, are up for revision and we took this opportunity to conduct an inductive study based primarily on interviews and observations of fifty actors actively working to disrupt them. In our study, we demonstrate the key role of professional values and meta-narratives as uniting devices of heterogeneous actors and the role these diverse actors play in interpreting differently the meanings associated with these values, allowing them to push different strategies while collaborating informally. We also provide a study of the ongoing process by which actors elaborate their day to day practices to perform institutional work, without taking into account the successes or unintended consequences of their actions."
2019,"Large-Scale Institutional Work: How Interveners Seed Human Rights Values and Practices in China While research has investigated institutional work at the field and organizational level, few research has looked into attempts by institutional interveners to shape societal-level institutions. Due to the scale involved in such attempts, the institutional intervener cannot conduct institutional work alone but has to mobilize actors across the society to seed change. Using a historical case study of the Ford Foundations grantmaking in China (1975-2008), we explore how an institutional intervener (the Foundation) seeded human rights values and practices in an authoritarian society. We find that the Foundation selected local embedded actors in sub-elite social positions and took purposeful actions (exposure, socialization, and experimentation) to trigger reflexivity in these actors. We also document how these actors moved to more prominent social and/or subject positions to promote rights-based values and practices in multiple fields. We label this approach the middle-out strategy and suggest that it allows interveners to cultivate and leverage sub-elites social position to trickle out large-scale change."
