Welcome to my personal website. I am assistant professor of Strategic Management and Entrepreneurship at the Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University Rotterdam. My research focuses on two related domains: 1) the question of how the two defining criteria of creativity—usefulness and novelty—relate to one another and shape the performance of individuals and organizations, and 2) the question of how different organizations strive to be from competitors to attain optimal performance (so-called ‘optimal distinctiveness’). This research agenda is positioned at the intersection of institutional theory, entrepreneurship, and strategic management. I supplement these lines of work with a strong methodological background—having published research on state-of-the-art methodologies such as curvilinear relationships and text analysis using machine learning. 

On this website, you can read more about my [research](https://rfjhaans.github.io/publications/) and [teaching](https://rfjhaans.github.io/teaching/), as well as materials related to theorizing and testing [curvilinear relationships](https://rfjhaans.github.io/ushapes/) and [topic modeling](https://rfjhaans.github.io/topicmodeling/).

In addition, I am currently the Data Analytics Chair for the Organization and Management Theory Division of the Academy of Management. You can find more information about my activities for the division [here](https://rfjhaans.github.io/omt/).
