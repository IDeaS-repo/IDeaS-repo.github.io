The IDeaS group is an emerging working group, coming out of a collaboration between the University of Alberta and University of British Columbia. Amongst others, we offer workshops that provides management doctoral students and faculty members working in the areas of data science, data analysis, Big Data, and artificial intelligence an opportunity to discuss and advance their ongoing research. Distinctively, we aim to draw together three interrelated topics that are more normally studied in separate scholarly communities:

- The reflexive and theoretically informed use of new data analytic techniques in the social sciences that leverage sophisticated algorithms such as topic modeling, natural language processing, and other forms of machine learning.
- The everyday work of data analysts in organizations – how they construct knowledge practices, and the epistemic infrastructures of organizations; both as an interesting ethnographic and qualitative topic in its own right, and as a means of encouraging our own reflexivity.
- The societal, social, and cultural transformations attending the rise of data and analytics including changing forms and interpretations of privacy and governmentality – to which social scientists should be able to speak.
