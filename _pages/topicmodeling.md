This is an adjusted version of a repository for literature on and applications of the topic modeling methodology. 
This repository was originally designed for the workshops on topic modeling that took place at the 2017 and 2018 Academy of Management Meeting, but is open to anyone interested. The original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/RFJHaans/topicmodeling)

Much of the ideas on this page are closely intertwined with ongoing work with the organizers of the PDW, most recently expressed our article in the <i>Academy of Management Annals</i>. The full paper can be found [here](https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/annals.2017.0099) and more information can be accessed [here](https://rfjhaans.github.io/publications/2019-topic-modeling/).

Please see [this page](https://github.com/RFJHaans/topicmodeling/blob/master/Output/Other/Getting%20code%20into%20R.md) for a step-by-step overview of using the repository. 

The set of slides from the various presentations during the 2018 PDW can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/RFJHaans/topicmodeling/raw/master/AoM-PDW-TModel_18_all_v3_1.pdf).
